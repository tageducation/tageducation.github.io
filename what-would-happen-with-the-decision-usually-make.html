Finding new information, being updated and aware to many different topics are some of their benefits. What would happen to our decision making if all of these do not exist? It would be really hard because there would be no more accurate source of news and information for us to base our decisions with. Without these important things, we would face a hard time making a quick and easy comparison between options, it would be hard for us to seek out expert and peer advice that enables us to act with greater confidence.</p><p></p><p></p><br />
