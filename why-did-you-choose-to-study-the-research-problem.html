                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>1</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong>In 2016, the proportion of 15 to 19 years old students in OECD countries who worked part-time while studying shows some variance. In countries like France, Italy, Japan, Mexico, and Chile, the number of people studying and working varied from less than 10% to more than 40% in Denmark, the Netherlands, and Switzerland (OECD 2018), while several countries have encouraged policies allowing young people to study without  working (for exmaple, Brazils Belsa Familia conditional cash transfer program), others have created programs encouraging young people to work while attending school (e.g. the 1994 School-to-work opportunities Act in the U.S)</p><p></p><p><strong>2</strong><strong>.</strong> According to the theory of time allocation (Becker, 1995), students who work and study at the same time have a negative impact on their academic success. The same findings are backed by other scientific structures (Signalling theory, spence, 1973, Socila Network theory, Granovetter, 1973, and  Screening approach stiglitz, 1975). Working when learning can be used as a signal of students liquidity limitations, which may lead to prejudice against students fron less advantaged social background,  according to the Statistical Discrimination model (Arrows, 1973). 3 working might have an effect in the amount of time spent on academic learning and activities (Busch et al 2012, Dustman and van Soest, 2007, kalengkoski and Pabilonia, 2010). However students who work part-time whilst in school do not actually do less academically than full-time students if they are able to affectively manage their time allowance, as in the case of substituting leisure for labor (Dundes and Marx, 2006, Butler, 2007).</p><p></p><p><strong>3</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong>According to the survey lead by Endsleigh (2015), eight noy of ten (77%) understudies are now employed part-time to assist with their financial needs in education. Working as a student is possibly stressfull because it involves managing your social life, family time, education, and work. Handling the tension that comes with being a working undergrad and knowing that you get at least one night offering week will reduce the stress levels considerable (Mitchell, 2016). According to CHED (2010), only half of the employed students can finish college, as many cannot concentrate on their studies, while other, have poor Heath, and other give up because of financial problem.</p><p></p><p><strong>4</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong>Around 216, 000 understudies in the Philippines are right now juggling School and work, the most recent information from the commission on Higher Education (CHED). About 8% out of total number of college students in the Philippines is a working students (ABS-CBN News 2010). In Davao Region, the low rates of the study accomplisment are the central concerns of the Department of Education (DepEd). The study of Ramento (2011), states that the low education attainment of the students in the city of Davao were due to a low salary which leads the students to combine working and studying. Thus, the students that have financial problems are sprending more time working than studying and because of this, they attained poor grade and poor performances in School.</p><p></p><p><strong>5</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong>The Research's objective is to find out how working while learning affects students. The study tend to look at and classify student's job experiences.</p><p></p><p><strong>Hope</strong><strong> </strong><strong>it</strong><strong> </strong><strong>helps</strong></p><p><strong>Good</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Luck</strong></p><p><strong>Pa</strong><strong> </strong><strong>brainlest</strong><strong> </strong><strong>and</strong><strong> </strong><strong>follow</strong><strong> </strong><strong>na</strong><strong> </strong><strong>din</strong></p><p></p><br />
