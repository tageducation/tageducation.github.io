                                            Here are a few tips to help prepare you for the defense:• Learn about the structureAsk your advisor about how the defense will be organized. Most defenses begin with a public presentation by the student, followed by a question and answer period alone with your committee. Know what to expect!•Outline the parts you'll presentKnow your research forwards and backwards. Rather than writing out your opening statement verbatim, use an outline to plan yout main and supporting points. In the opening statement you'll want to introduce your project, the questions that drove your research, your methods, and your results (and how your results are significant).•Attend another defenseChances are good that you've attended colleagues' defenses for the last few years. If you haven't, attend a few so you can see what they're like—from the format to the types of questions that are asked.•Talk to colleagues who've successfully defendedLearn more about the dynamics in the defense and how defenses have gone in the past. Their experiences (and living proof that students survive this experience!) can help you feel more comfortable with your own. •Anticipate possible questionsSpend time thinking about what your committee might ask (keep their own areas of interest in mind!), and outline how you can address concerns they might raise. As with outlining the introduction, think about the main points you want to address when you answer the question.•Practice, Practice, PracticeAs you prepare, don't just write down what you plan to say during your presentation, or answers to potential questions. Speak aloud to get comfortable with the flow of ideas. This practice may make it easier for you to anticipate how others will respond to your thoughts, and that in turn will help you be better prepared.•Dress the partHow you present yourself affects how your committee members see you and also how you see yourself. Whether you invest in a whole new outfit or simply a pair of shoes that are your "defense shoes," make an effort to present "the best you."•Have an answer ready (for questions you don't know the answer to)Your committee will be trying to identify the edge of what you know, and gauging your response when you're confronted with it. It's best to recognize and admit  it when your research didn't address this topic, or if you just don't know the answer. If you're not sure you understood the question, rephrase it. If appropriate, you might explain why your dissertation research didn't address the specific point, that the posed question could lead to further research, and you might improvise what a project designed to answer the question might look like. By showing that you could synthesize an answer, even while acknowledging that you do not know the answer, shows that you can effectively think on your feet and know the ways your field can be expanded.•Don't interruptIf the members of your committee are hashing things out over a smaller detail of your work or they're discussing tangential topics, use the time to sit back, take a sip of water, and regroup.​</a>

Previously, the company had never outsourced a temporary recruitment agency domestically for their staffing motives, however due to the exigency, the company executives decided to tie up with human resource staffing agencies. High number of competent workers needed is the main reason of the decision of company to come up in partnering with staffing firms to acquire the lack of workforce they had locally in their Human Resource department. The competency, educational attainment, and job experience of the needed employees were an extensive range which requires various recruitment personnel to handle each. The following job vacancies include purchasing, sales, warehouse managers, general labours and clerical employees. Time frame of two weeks was set up to deliver a total of 175 employees in the first month. Questions: 1. Describe the main challenge/s of Deca MaGarne Da Construction Inc.?​</a>

Sneezing is a reflex that your body doesautomatically That means you cannot make yourself sneeze or stop oneonce it has started. When you sneeze, your body is trying to get rid of badthings in your nose, such as bacteria. You have extra germs when you havea cold, so you sneeze a lot more. You might also sneeze when you smellpepper! Inside your nose, there are hundreds of tiny hairs. These hairs filterthe air you breathe. Sometimes dust and pollen find their way throughthese hairs and bother your nasal passages. The nerves in the lining of yournose tell your brain that something is invading your body. Your brain,lungs, nose, mouth, and the muscles of your upper body work together toblow away the invaders with a sneeze. When you sneeze, germs from yournose get blown into the air. Using a tissue or "sneezing into your sleeve"captures most of these germs. It is very important to wash your hands afteryou sneeze into them, especially during cold and flu season. Do you eversneeze when you walk into bright sunlight? About 25% of people experiencethis phenomenon. Scientists believe that the brain gets confused whensignals from the optic nerve trigger the sneezing reflex in direct sunlight.This usually runs in families. If someone nearby sneezes, remember to tellthem "Gesundheit!" That is a funny looking word which is pronounced "gezz-oont-hite." It is the German word that wishes someone good health aftersneezing.Learning Task 1: Note details by answering the questions below. Writeyour answers in your notebook.1. Which parts of your body work together when you sneeze?2. What does the German word gesundheit mean?a. I wish you good health. b. I wish you God's blessings.c. I wish you a good day. d. I wish you would stop sneezing.3. Why do some people sneeze when they walk into bright sunlight?​</a>

                            7. Here are a few tips to help prepare you for the defense:• Learn about the structureAsk your advisor about how the defense will be organized. Most defenses begin with a public presentation by the student, followed by a question and answer period alone with your committee. Know what to expect!•Outline the parts you'll presentKnow your research forwards and backwards. Rather than writing out your opening statement verbatim, use an outline to plan yout main and supporting points. In the opening statement you'll want to introduce your project, the questions that drove your research, your methods, and your results (and how your results are significant).•Attend another defenseChances are good that you've attended colleagues' defenses for the last few years. If you haven't, attend a few so you can see what they're like—from the format to the types of questions that are asked.•Talk to colleagues who've successfully defendedLearn more about the dynamics in the defense and how defenses have gone in the past. Their experiences (and living proof that students survive this experience!) can help you feel more comfortable with your own. •Anticipate possible questionsSpend time thinking about what your committee might ask (keep their own areas of interest in mind!), and outline how you can address concerns they might raise. As with outlining the introduction, think about the main points you want to address when you answer the question.•Practice, Practice, PracticeAs you prepare, don't just write down what you plan to say during your presentation, or answers to potential questions. Speak aloud to get comfortable with the flow of ideas. This practice may make it easier for you to anticipate how others will respond to your thoughts, and that in turn will help you be better prepared.•Dress the partHow you present yourself affects how your committee members see you and also how you see yourself. Whether you invest in a whole new outfit or simply a pair of shoes that are your "defense shoes," make an effort to present "the best you."•Have an answer ready (for questions you don't know the answer to)Your committee will be trying to identify the edge of what you know, and gauging your response when you're confronted with it. It's best to recognize and admit  it when your research didn't address this topic, or if you just don't know the answer. If you're not sure you understood the question, rephrase it. If appropriate, you might explain why your dissertation research didn't address the specific point, that the posed question could lead to further research, and you might improvise what a project designed to answer the question might look like. By showing that you could synthesize an answer, even while acknowledging that you do not know the answer, shows that you can effectively think on your feet and know the ways your field can be expanded.•Don't interruptIf the members of your committee are hashing things out over a smaller detail of your work or they're discussing tangential topics, use the time to sit back, take a sip of water, and regroup.​</h2><br />

Case Study Deca MaGarne Da Construction Inc. is the leading wholesale distributor of construction supplies in the Philippines, and one of the country's largest distributors of hardware equipment, tools, and other interior and exterior building commodities and related products. The business started in late 1980's and grown its countrywide organization with more than 369 facilities and branches in most of the cities in the Philippines. The business venture reached over P50 billion sales and has existing four ISO certifications, certificates which issued to companies with enhanced quality management system. It has over 8,000 direct-hired employees who stayed for an average of 12 years in the company due to better staffing approach and retention programs. Deca MaGarne Da Construction Inc. in Pampanga market, which included 12 different stores, required instantaneous provisional workers to convene their staffing demands due to natural hazards and risks such as typhoon and earthquakes that happened in Pampanga in the summer of 2019. Previously, the company had never outsourced a temporary recruitment agency domestically for their staffing motives, however due to the exigency, the company executives decided to tie up with human resource staffing agencies. High number of competent workers needed is the main reason of the decision of company to come up in partnering with staffing firms to acquire the lack of workforce they had locally in their Human Resource department. The competency, educational attainment, and job experience of the needed employees were an extensive range which requires various recruitment personnel to handle each. The following job vacancies include purchasing, sales, warehouse managers, general labours and clerical employees. Time frame of two weeks was set up to deliver a total of 175 employees in the first month. Questions: 1. Describe the main challenge/s of Deca MaGarne Da Construction Inc.?​</h2><br />

This involves the process of noting essential information that textswritersYouAchooby Cynthia SherwoodWe all sneeze sometimes. Sneezing is a reflex that your body doesautomatically That means you cannot make yourself sneeze or stop oneonce it has started. When you sneeze, your body is trying to get rid of badthings in your nose, such as bacteria. You have extra germs when you havea cold, so you sneeze a lot more. You might also sneeze when you smellpepper! Inside your nose, there are hundreds of tiny hairs. These hairs filterthe air you breathe. Sometimes dust and pollen find their way throughthese hairs and bother your nasal passages. The nerves in the lining of yournose tell your brain that something is invading your body. Your brain,lungs, nose, mouth, and the muscles of your upper body work together toblow away the invaders with a sneeze. When you sneeze, germs from yournose get blown into the air. Using a tissue or "sneezing into your sleeve"captures most of these germs. It is very important to wash your hands afteryou sneeze into them, especially during cold and flu season. Do you eversneeze when you walk into bright sunlight? About 25% of people experiencethis phenomenon. Scientists believe that the brain gets confused whensignals from the optic nerve trigger the sneezing reflex in direct sunlight.This usually runs in families. If someone nearby sneezes, remember to tellthem "Gesundheit!" That is a funny looking word which is pronounced "gezz-oont-hite." It is the German word that wishes someone good health aftersneezing.Learning Task 1: Note details by answering the questions below. Writeyour answers in your notebook.1. Which parts of your body work together when you sneeze?2. What does the German word gesundheit mean?a. I wish you good health. b. I wish you God's blessings.c. I wish you a good day. d. I wish you would stop sneezing.3. Why do some people sneeze when they walk into bright sunlight?​</h2><br />
