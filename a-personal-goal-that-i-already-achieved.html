We waited for the elevator to move. A few minutes passed by, it started moving, unusually slow. Then, without warning, it halted. 2. Hard work is shown by doing a task eagerly. People need to work so they can earn a living. Parents need to work so they can send their children to school and buy them the things they need. It is very important that as early as now, children like you already know how to work. You can do chores at home to help your parents. You can also do your homework diligently to show that you are industrious. Your parents will be glad to see you grow up to be a hardworking person. Lazy people do not succeed in life. Be lazy and you will not achieve your goal. Work hard and reach for your dreams. 15Need napo plss​</a>

People need to work so they can earn a living. Parents need to work so they can send their children to school and buy them the things they need. It is very important that as early as now, children like you already know how to work. You can do chores at home to help your parents. You can also do your homework diligently to show that you are industrious. Your parents will be glad to see you grow up to be a hardworking person. Lazy people do not succeed in life. Be lazy and you will not achieve your goal. Work hard and reach for your dreams. 15​</a>

                                            Do not envy those people who were born great but rather, make yourself great through hardwork. Perhaps, we all grow through the process. Just like the flower, it needs proper care, right amount of water until it grows and becomes a beautiful flower that everyone will admire it. And you, you are like a flower who grows every single day of your life. You are like an art that even it is not colourful and it is just simple, you can still call it a masterpiece. You are flawed by design, your imperfections is what makes you perfect. You deserve all the love and not to be swathe by dilemmas, that even though you were destructed by many, loving yourself is still eternity.I used to envy someone people for the fact that they have the things that I want. Will they call me plagiarist for the fact that I am trying to copy them because all people love them? Will they sue me for committing mistake and that is to hate someone because of too much envious of that person? Because of toxic high standards in our society I became someone that isn’t really me. And I realized something, as I keep on growing each day, starting to comprehend things everyday. I realized that—Never let their wordsmakes you doubt aboutyourself and change you.Never let their glancemakes you scared of them.Never let them take offyour self-confidence.And never let them controlyour decisions in life.“Do not change yourself for others and let others change for you. You don't need to adjust yourself just to fit yourself with them.”Today, I woke up loving thyself— negative thoughts already left and I am embracing myself for who really I am. Today, I’m starting to do what I really want for myself and what really makes me happy. I don’t need wings to fly because I am already a fairy, achieving my goals in life with my own hand. I don't need super power to attain everything that I want because I’ve realized that myself will never leave me and I don’t need someone for I have myself. Today, I don’t need to envy those perfect character in the noble that I always read, I became happy in my life knowing that I am the leading lady of my own story.I’ve realized that I don’t need someone to fulfill the things that I want because I have me. I am the writer of my life and I am the one who’s doing my fate. Today, I am looking at the mirror, I’m happy knowing that this is me, the someone that I used to hate before is now loving herself for who really she was.​</a>

                                            Read the following persuasive essay carefully. Encircle the verbs, box the adjectives, and underline the adverbs that express strong or pressing points. Why People Should Exercise In the past, I have never been inclined to participate in sports. Honestly, I did not like it, but many persons whom I lived with kept telling me every day how good it was. Since the peer pressure was growing, I decided to go to the gym. It was not until then that I could really understand people when they said exercise really helped a person get organized and keep yourself healthy, physically and mentally. For starters, when you are a lazy person, it is difficult to take the first step, but it is all a matter of committing yourself to something that will provide you a lot of positive feedback. Once you start doing exercise and observing positive results, you enjoy it. It takes a lot of effort and strong will, but it's worth it. The principal thing to do is to participate in an activity you like. If you do you’ll start organizing your day in a way that enables you to do everything you have to, including exercising. You will no longer be a person stressed-out without time to carry on with all your activities. Second, it is obvious that once you exercise you will have a better condition. You will be healthier in a physical way. It is probable that you will lose weight and your muscles will get stronger and stronger. Your body will feel good, full of energy and it will respond immediately to any action you want to do, any activity that has to be done with high spirits. The third reason why exercising is good is that it affects you positively in a mental and psychological way. Doing exercise helps you set specific goals which along with strong will can be achieved. When you do that, you are aware of your abilities, accept your weaknesses, and your self-esteem goes up. Any sport distracts you because it helps you not to think about school, friends, problems, among other things. It brings you time to think about yourself and no one else. It helps you keep your mind busy and to avoid dangerous habits like drugs. Doing exercise is very important to any person of any age. The positive effects of exercising, which I’ve already mentioned, are like a chain. Once you do a sports activity that you like, you get organized; therefore, you start doing things the right way and get enormous benefits which make you feel good as a whole human being. You start living your life happily. ​</a>

People need to work so they can earn a living. Parents need to work so they can send their children to school and buy them the things they need.

                            13. Do not envy those people who were born great but rather, make yourself great through hardwork. Perhaps, we all grow through the process. Just like the flower, it needs proper care, right amount of water until it grows and becomes a beautiful flower that everyone will admire it. And you, you are like a flower who grows every single day of your life. You are like an art that even it is not colourful and it is just simple, you can still call it a masterpiece. You are flawed by design, your imperfections is what makes you perfect. You deserve all the love and not to be swathe by dilemmas, that even though you were destructed by many, loving yourself is still eternity.I used to envy someone people for the fact that they have the things that I want. Will they call me plagiarist for the fact that I am trying to copy them because all people love them? Will they sue me for committing mistake and that is to hate someone because of too much envious of that person? Because of toxic high standards in our society I became someone that isn’t really me. And I realized something, as I keep on growing each day, starting to comprehend things everyday. I realized that—Never let their wordsmakes you doubt aboutyourself and change you.Never let their glancemakes you scared of them.Never let them take offyour self-confidence.And never let them controlyour decisions in life.“Do not change yourself for others and let others change for you. You don't need to adjust yourself just to fit yourself with them.”Today, I woke up loving thyself— negative thoughts already left and I am embracing myself for who really I am. Today, I’m starting to do what I really want for myself and what really makes me happy. I don’t need wings to fly because I am already a fairy, achieving my goals in life with my own hand. I don't need super power to attain everything that I want because I’ve realized that myself will never leave me and I don’t need someone for I have myself. Today, I don’t need to envy those perfect character in the noble that I always read, I became happy in my life knowing that I am the leading lady of my own story.I’ve realized that I don’t need someone to fulfill the things that I want because I have me. I am the writer of my life and I am the one who’s doing my fate. Today, I am looking at the mirror, I’m happy knowing that this is me, the someone that I used to hate before is now loving herself for who really she was.​</h2><br />

                            19. Read the following persuasive essay carefully. Encircle the verbs, box the adjectives, and underline the adverbs that express strong or pressing points. Why People Should Exercise In the past, I have never been inclined to participate in sports. Honestly, I did not like it, but many persons whom I lived with kept telling me every day how good it was. Since the peer pressure was growing, I decided to go to the gym. It was not until then that I could really understand people when they said exercise really helped a person get organized and keep yourself healthy, physically and mentally. For starters, when you are a lazy person, it is difficult to take the first step, but it is all a matter of committing yourself to something that will provide you a lot of positive feedback. Once you start doing exercise and observing positive results, you enjoy it. It takes a lot of effort and strong will, but it's worth it. The principal thing to do is to participate in an activity you like. If you do you’ll start organizing your day in a way that enables you to do everything you have to, including exercising. You will no longer be a person stressed-out without time to carry on with all your activities. Second, it is obvious that once you exercise you will have a better condition. You will be healthier in a physical way. It is probable that you will lose weight and your muscles will get stronger and stronger. Your body will feel good, full of energy and it will respond immediately to any action you want to do, any activity that has to be done with high spirits. The third reason why exercising is good is that it affects you positively in a mental and psychological way. Doing exercise helps you set specific goals which along with strong will can be achieved. When you do that, you are aware of your abilities, accept your weaknesses, and your self-esteem goes up. Any sport distracts you because it helps you not to think about school, friends, problems, among other things. It brings you time to think about yourself and no one else. It helps you keep your mind busy and to avoid dangerous habits like drugs. Doing exercise is very important to any person of any age. The positive effects of exercising, which I’ve already mentioned, are like a chain. Once you do a sports activity that you like, you get organized; therefore, you start doing things the right way and get enormous benefits which make you feel good as a whole human being. You start living your life happily. ​</h2><br />
