He knew that he has failed all of his subjects and had to be retained in the same grade level.

Now, he realized that he has to take schooling seriously if he wants to move up to higher grade level and succeed in his academic life. What can you say about the narrative? Formulate three (3) statements of assertion or opinion based on Carlo's experience. 1. 2. 3.​</a>

                                            He Left So I Could Learn It was my second day on the job. I was sitting in my seemingly gilded cubicle, overlooking Manhattan, and pinching my right arm to make sure it was real. I landed an internship at Condé Nast Traveler. Every aspiring writer I’ve ever known secretly dreamt of an Anthony Bourdain lifestyle. Travel the world and write about its most colorful pockets. When my phone rang, and it was Mom telling me Dad had a heart attack. He didn’t make it. I felt as though the perfectly carpeted floors had dropped out from under me. Now that I’ve come out the other side, I realize Dad left me with a hefty stack of teachings. Here are three ideals I know he would’ve liked for me to embrace. First, you have to stand on your own two feet. As much as our parents love and support us, they can’t go to our school and confess to the principal that we stole a candy bar from Sara. We have to do that. Neither can they walk into the Condé Nast office and nail a job interview for us. At some point, we have to put on our “big girl pants” and be brave, even if we’re not. Also, there’s a difference between love and co-dependence. Being grateful to have someone to turn to for love and support is not the same as needing someone to turn to for love and support. With the loss of my father, I’ve also lost my sounding board. All I can glean from that is it’s time to look within myself and make proper assessments. If I can’t make sound decisions with the tools already in my kit, then I risk falling for anything. Finally, memories are, perhaps, the only item that cannot be taken away from us. Will I miss my father? Every single day. What can I do in those times? I can open up our suitcase of memories, pick out my favorite one, and dream about it, talk about it, or write about it. Maybe I can’t pick up the phone and call him anymore, but that doesn’t mean he’s gone. Next week, I’m off to Istanbul to explore their art scene. As soon as I read the email from my editor, I picked up my phone to call Dad. Then, I realized he’ll never answer my calls again. I fought back the tears, got up to make a cup of peppermint tea, and added a new note to my iPhone titled, “Istanbul Packing List.” In the end, life goes on. I’m not sure why he had to leave during the single most poignant chapter in my life. So, I won’t dwell on that. Instead, I’ll hold tightly to these three ideals and write about Karaköy in Istanbul’s Beyoğlu district. Dad will be with me every step of the way.

School uniforms are good for the development of children. First of all, everyone is dressed unified. So no one has"better” clothes than others and no one can threaten others only because of their clothes. In many schools ganging up on othersbecause of what they are wearing is already normal and uniforms are a way to protect the children from such acts.School uniforms also keep everyone from having to buy expensive brand of clothes to be part of the society, which relievesespecially the parents and takes the pressure of being "cool" awayfrom the children. School uniforms also help to put, off children being overly concerned about keeping up with the latestfashions. This gives young children more time to concentrate on more important developmental things. Of course, there arealso critics, who say that school uniforms make the children lose their own individuality but in general it is possible to say, thatschool uniforms have a good influence on most children. (Expository)2. The school fair is right around the corner, and tickets have just gone on sale. We are selling a limited number of ticketsat discounts, so move fast and get yours while they are still available. This is going to be an event you will not want to miss!(Persuasive)3. Perhaps, since I am a high school student, somebody might say that I have my entire life ahead of me, with all of itsbeautiful experiences. But, despite being so young, I already have a personal breathtaking experience, which I am sure I willcarry with me until my last days. What I am talking about here is my first hike to the mountains. (Narrative)4. Studies have shown that lucky people tend to be far more open to new experiences. Those who are unlucky arecreatures of habit, never varying from one day to the next. If you want to be lucky, add some variety to your life. Meet newpeople, go to the new places, and increase the possibility of those chance opportunities the “lucky' people always seem to runinto. (Persuasive)5. Pat Mora's poem, "Echoes," vividly describes the meaning and mood of the poem by using sensory images. At thebeginning of the poem it was talking about white wine and cool dresses which give you a feel of upperclass elegance. Yet when itwent from the white wine to the white uniform it changed the class of the hostess and the maid. When it mentioned that themaid's smile wavered when the speaker started to talk to her, it showed the level of amazement that the maid felt. However, theend, when it talks about hearing the cruel comment of “just drop the cups and plates / on the grass," it gave the poem a feelingof darkness as the poem told how the speaker stood in silence which describes her contradicting feelings. Towardsthe end of the poem the roar and flash help the reader envision the speaker's rage for the cruelty that is being calmed in a racistsociety. (Explanatory)D.

                            14. He Left So I Could Learn It was my second day on the job. I was sitting in my seemingly gilded cubicle, overlooking Manhattan, and pinching my right arm to make sure it was real. I landed an internship at Condé Nast Traveler. Every aspiring writer I’ve ever known secretly dreamt of an Anthony Bourdain lifestyle. Travel the world and write about its most colorful pockets. When my phone rang, and it was Mom telling me Dad had a heart attack. He didn’t make it. I felt as though the perfectly carpeted floors had dropped out from under me. Now that I’ve come out the other side, I realize Dad left me with a hefty stack of teachings. Here are three ideals I know he would’ve liked for me to embrace. First, you have to stand on your own two feet. As much as our parents love and support us, they can’t go to our school and confess to the principal that we stole a candy bar from Sara. We have to do that. Neither can they walk into the Condé Nast office and nail a job interview for us. At some point, we have to put on our “big girl pants” and be brave, even if we’re not. Also, there’s a difference between love and co-dependence. Being grateful to have someone to turn to for love and support is not the same as needing someone to turn to for love and support. With the loss of my father, I’ve also lost my sounding board. All I can glean from that is it’s time to look within myself and make proper assessments. If I can’t make sound decisions with the tools already in my kit, then I risk falling for anything. Finally, memories are, perhaps, the only item that cannot be taken away from us. Will I miss my father? Every single day. What can I do in those times? I can open up our suitcase of memories, pick out my favorite one, and dream about it, talk about it, or write about it. Maybe I can’t pick up the phone and call him anymore, but that doesn’t mean he’s gone. Next week, I’m off to Istanbul to explore their art scene. As soon as I read the email from my editor, I picked up my phone to call Dad. Then, I realized he’ll never answer my calls again. I fought back the tears, got up to make a cup of peppermint tea, and added a new note to my iPhone titled, “Istanbul Packing List.” In the end, life goes on. I’m not sure why he had to leave during the single most poignant chapter in my life. So, I won’t dwell on that. Instead, I’ll hold tightly to these three ideals and write about Karaköy in Istanbul’s Beyoğlu district. Dad will be with me every step of the way.

What were the ideals did her father left her with? 2. Why did she opted to stand rather fumble as she loses her dad? 3. How did she overcome with such ordeal? 4.

Then, on the space provided before the number, write N if the paragraph isNarrative, E if Expository, P if Persuasive and EX if Explanatory.1. School uniforms are good for the development of children. First of all, everyone is dressed unified. So no one has"better” clothes than others and no one can threaten others only because of their clothes. In many schools ganging up on othersbecause of what they are wearing is already normal and uniforms are a way to protect the children from such acts.School uniforms also keep everyone from having to buy expensive brand of clothes to be part of the society, which relievesespecially the parents and takes the pressure of being "cool" awayfrom the children. School uniforms also help to put, off children being overly concerned about keeping up with the latestfashions. This gives young children more time to concentrate on more important developmental things. Of course, there arealso critics, who say that school uniforms make the children lose their own individuality but in general it is possible to say, thatschool uniforms have a good influence on most children. (Expository)2. The school fair is right around the corner, and tickets have just gone on sale. We are selling a limited number of ticketsat discounts, so move fast and get yours while they are still available. This is going to be an event you will not want to miss!(Persuasive)3. Perhaps, since I am a high school student, somebody might say that I have my entire life ahead of me, with all of itsbeautiful experiences. But, despite being so young, I already have a personal breathtaking experience, which I am sure I willcarry with me until my last days. What I am talking about here is my first hike to the mountains. (Narrative)4. Studies have shown that lucky people tend to be far more open to new experiences. Those who are unlucky arecreatures of habit, never varying from one day to the next. If you want to be lucky, add some variety to your life. Meet newpeople, go to the new places, and increase the possibility of those chance opportunities the “lucky' people always seem to runinto. (Persuasive)5. Pat Mora's poem, "Echoes," vividly describes the meaning and mood of the poem by using sensory images. At thebeginning of the poem it was talking about white wine and cool dresses which give you a feel of upperclass elegance. Yet when itwent from the white wine to the white uniform it changed the class of the hostess and the maid. When it mentioned that themaid's smile wavered when the speaker started to talk to her, it showed the level of amazement that the maid felt. However, theend, when it talks about hearing the cruel comment of “just drop the cups and plates / on the grass," it gave the poem a feelingof darkness as the poem told how the speaker stood in silence which describes her contradicting feelings. Towardsthe end of the poem the roar and flash help the reader envision the speaker's rage for the cruelty that is being calmed in a racistsociety. (Explanatory)D.
