                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><strong>How are your stress signals differ for different types of stressors?</strong><p></p><p>It depends on your maturity and the gravity of the stressors that occur. Your stress signals will tell you that you are experiencing stress. Different people have different stress signals in different situations and they deal with it differently and uniquely compared to others. You cannot expect a person to act the same on the stressors. Others deal with it immediately while others make take some time overcoming stress. </p><strong>Typical stressors that everyone experiences:</strong>Life-changing situations - this is the most common stressor everybody experiences. Since we have the tendencies to make routinary activities that will become habits soon, unexpected or abrupt changes in this area becomes a great stressor. Examples of these are death of a loved one, forced separation from family, or engagement in military battles.Unexpected situations - these happen without any plan and most of the time, you are caught unaware of it. Because you are surprised with it, the stress may rise up due to the pressure from people around you. Depending on the personality of the person, though it may be as simple as it is to most of us, they have the tendency to panic thus leading to poor decision making. Environment - it pertains to the group or community you belong. Different groups of people have different perspectives and different styles and methods of dealing a particular event in life. Culture, customs, and traditions are some of the examples under this category. <p>Since everyone has their own means and methods of dealing things, we cannot expect someone to do what you are expecting from them. It may be easy for them to deal their stress while others look at it as the biggest decision they have to make. Some of the factors might be:</p>Personality - depending on his temperament, one may deal it with full confidence that they can bear it while others may need the help of the people around him to be strong enough to face life challenges.Values - our dealing with stress varies depending on the set of values a person have. His values and priorities in life greatly affects a person's decision-making process. Mental maturity - one's mental condition also affects how a stressor is faced. A person may be looking fine but we really don't know what's going on in his mind. People who needs mental care and support should always be considered. The choice of words and actions will greatly help them in facing their stressors.<strong>How can you help others in dealing with stress:</strong>Find someone you can trust, a friend maybe, and share life experiences with them. A constant conversation with others will help you build trust and confidence in yourself. This will also lead to self-acceptance.Choose appropriate words and actions and do it in the proper time. Though people may seem they need help, learn the art of proper timing in doing so. Those who suffer great loss after a tragedy are too sensitive that one inappropriate word may trigger them to anger and resentment. Always let them feel that they are loved, they are not alone, and you are always available when they need someone. Your actions can also bridge gaps in relationships. You may not say anything but people who are stressed really appreciate people who are there for them.<p>There are more ways on how we can handle stress.

                            10. prioritize your stressors from most  stressful to least stressful​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Accept how you feel instead of judging yourself.</p><p>One of the most detrimental effects of stress is that people tend to get down on themselves about how they feel. You already have a handful of anxiety-provoking things on your mind. What you need least is the addition of a judgmental voice arguing you shouldn't be stressed.</p><p></p><p>Instead, accept how you feel. Don't hate yourself for it; this is your reality. When you do that, you're taking away any negative energy spent judging. It will allow you to instead observe how you feel. You will be able to objectively see what's stressing you out and why.</p><p></p><p>Over time, you can develop this habit and begin to see patterns that lead to stress. That will be extremely helpful in overcoming those feelings and learning how to prevent them in the first place.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Related: 5 Ways to Stop Worrying What Others Think</p><p></p><p>2. Write down everything you need to get out.</p><p>Take the less than five minutes required to do a mind dump. Get everything bothering you out on paper. Write down what's stressing you out, all that you have to do and the other thoughts or ideas occupying your mind. This will eliminate the urge to keep everything inside your head. Doing so will immediately lessen your stress levels; there will be less to hold onto, and your mind will be free to occupy other tasks and ideas.</p><p></p><p>Related: The Amazing Side Benefit of Writing a Daily To-Do List</p><p></p><p>3. Take a break.</p><p>Despite the mountain of items you might need to accomplish, you should first take a break when you're feeling overly stressed. It can even be for just a few minutes. On top of helping you feel better, it will end up making you more productive. After an effective break, you will be able to better focus on the tasks at hand and home in on what you need to accomplish.</p><p></p><p>This break looks different for everyone. You could listen to music, do breathing exercises, read a book, play with your kids or pet or go for a walk around your block. If you don't know what's most effective at cooling you down, try different activities. See when you feel most relaxed so you can do those things more frequently.</p><p></p><p>Having these relaxing activities, even if it's just for a few minutes, can be a great way to eliminate stress and get back on task.</p><p></p><p>Related: 5 Reasons Science Says You Seriously Need to Take a Break</p><p></p><p>4. Spend 10 minutes prioritizing.</p><p>In addition to writing down all that's on your mind, spend 10 minutes prioritizing your tasks. What's the most urgent? What can wait for a week? Is there anything you can eliminate altogether? Doing this will allow you to spend your time working on what's most important.</p><p></p><p>When we have so much on our to-do lists, it's often easiest to pick the simplest tasks or the ones we want to do the most. While that knocks something off, it's not always the right thing. You can end up spending hours working on items you don't even need until next week and neglecting things needed today. By prioritizing, you'll help yourself focus on those of utmost importance.</p><p></p><p>Related: First Things First: The 5 Secrets to Prioritization</p><p></p><p>5. Laugh with somebody about something.</p><p>Laughter is a powerful medicine. This is especially true when you're stressed. Whether it's a TV show, a YouTube channel or one of your loved ones, try to find ways to laugh. It will put your stress in a larger context and lighten your load.</p><p></p><p>Related: The Surprising Benefits of Laughter</p><p></p><p></p><p>6. Exercise</p><p>Even if you're only committing to some jumping jacks or running in place, getting your body moving will reduce stress. You'd be surprised at the many ways your body can hold stress. If there are areas where you feel tight, stretch them out; it's likely you're holding stress in those places.</p><p></p><p>If you have more time, longer workouts will also release endorphins that are beneficial for stress levels and will leave you feeling much more energized.</p><p></p><p>Related: 7 Reasons Every Entrepreneur Should Start the Day With Exercise</p><p></p><p>7. Put it in a larger context.</p><p>Try to take a step back from all you have going on. Despite how heavy, scary and important the tasks on your plate might feel, it's likely not the end of the world. If you fall a bit short in one place or are not able to give a different task your all, things tend to work out just fine. For some, it helps to play out the worst scenario -- the worst possible outcome is often not as bad as you're imagining.</p><p></p><p>Letting the back-and-forth rhythm of life deeply affect you and ruin your daily experience isn't worth it. Instead, realize how you are feeling; try to accept it. The act of realization and putting your stress into the bigger picture of life, as well as remembering how much good you have going on, can help you feel immediately better.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                            21. How are you stress signals different for different types of stressors</h2><br />
                        It depends on your maturity and the gravity of the stressors that occur. Your stress signals will tell you that you are experiencing stress. Different people have different stress signals in different situations and they deal with it differently and uniquely compared to others. You cannot expect a person to act the same on the stressors. Others deal with it immediately while others make take some time overcoming stress.<br />Typical stressors that everyone experiences:<br />Life-changing situations - this is the most common stressor everybody experiences. Since we have the tendencies to make routinary activities that will become habits soon, unexpected or abrupt changes in this area becomes a great stressor. Examples of these are death of a loved one, forced separation from family, or engagement in military battles.<br />Unexpected situations - these happen without any plan and most of the time, you are caught unaware of it. Because you are surprised with it, the stress may rise up due to the pressure from people around you. Depending on the personality of the person, though it may be as simple as it is to most of us, they have the tendency to panic thus leading to poor decision making.<br />Environment - it pertains to the group or community you belong. Different groups of people have different perspectives and different styles and methods of dealing a particular event in life. Culture, customs, and traditions are some of the examples under this category.<br />Since everyone has their own means and methods of dealing things, we cannot expect someone to do what you are expecting from them. It may be easy for them to deal their stress while others look at it as the biggest decision they have to make. Some of the factors might be:<br />Personality - depending on his temperament, one may deal it with full confidence that they can bear it while others may need the help of the people around him to be strong enough to face life challenges.<br />Values - our dealing with stress varies depending on the set of values a person have. His values and priorities in life greatly affects a person's decision-making process.<br />Mental maturity - one's mental condition also affects how a stressor is faced. A person may be looking fine but we really don't know what's going on in his mind. People who needs mental care and support should always be considered. The choice of words and actions will greatly help them in facing their stressors.<br />How can you help others in dealing with stress:<br />Find someone you can trust, a friend maybe, and share life experiences with them. A constant conversation with others will help you build trust and confidence in yourself. This will also lead to self-acceptance.<br />Choose appropriate words and actions and do it in the proper time. Though people may seem they need help, learn the art of proper timing in doing so. Those who suffer great loss after a tragedy are too sensitive that one inappropriate word may trigger them to anger and resentment.<br />Always let them feel that they are loved, they are not alone, and you are always available when they need someone. Your actions can also bridge gaps in relationships. You may not say anything but people who are stressed really appreciate people who are there for them.<br /><br />Pa brainliest po:)<br />Ty sa points<br />

                            30. How are you stress signals different for different types of stressor? own answers lang po:)​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>It depends on your maturity and the gravity of the stressors that occur. Your stress signals will tell you that you are experiencing stress. Different people have different stress signals in different situations and they deal with it differently and uniquely compared to others. You cannot expect a person to act the same on the stressors. Others deal with it immediately while others make take some time overcoming stress.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong> My own way to deal with it</strong></p><p>Find someone you can trust, a friend maybe, and share life experiences with them. A constant conversation with others will help you build trust and confidence in yourself. This will also lead to self-acceptance.</p><p></p><p><strong>Other examples of how you deal it:</strong></p><p>-Choose appropriate words and actions and do it in the proper time. Though people may seem they need help, learn the art of proper timing in doing so. Those who suffer great loss after a tragedy are too sensitive that one inappropriate word may trigger them to anger and resentment.
</p><p>-Always let them feel that they are loved, they are not alone, and you are always available when they need someone. Your actions can also bridge gaps in relationships. You may not say anything but people who are stressed really appreciate people who are there for them.</p><br />
