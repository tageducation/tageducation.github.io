                                            1. Before clocks were made, people kept track of time by other means. In ancient Egypt, people used a water clock. Water dripped slowly from one clay pot into another. People measured time according to how long it took one pot to empty and the other one to fill. Candle clocks were common during the Middle Ages. As such, when a candle burned, marks on its side showed about how much time had passed. A final ancient way to measure time was the sundial, which used the movement of the sun across the sky. The shadows moving across the face of the sundial showed the current time.What is the main idea? a. As such, when a candle burned, marks on its side showed about how much time had passed b. Before clocks were made, people kept track by other means. c. In ancient Egypt, people used a water clock. d. All the above. 2. (1) One common example of instinct is the spider's spinning of its intricate web. (2) No one teaches a spider how to spin: its inborn instinct allows it to accomplish the task. (3) Another example of instinctive behavior is the salmon's struggle to swim upstream to lay eggs. (4) It would be much easier for the salmon to follow the current downstream, but instinct overrides all other considerations. (5) Instinct is clearly a strong influence on animal behavior. What is the main idea? a. Sentence 1 b. Sentence 2 c. Sentence 3 d. Sentence 5 3. (1) In response to customers' bitter complaints about long lines, banks are trying new ways to shorten the wait or at least to make it more pleasant. (2) One bank provides coffee and cookies so customers can munch while they wait. (3) Other banks show action movies on a large video screen. (4) One daring bank in California will pay a customer five dollars if he or she must wait more than five minutes for service. (5) Still other banks offer the most obvious solution of all...they simply hire more bank tellers. a. Sentence 3 b. Sentence 4 c. Sentence 1 d.

                                            About Invertebrates- Invertebrates are animals without a backbone or bony skeleton.They range in size from microscopic mites and almost invisible flies to giant squid with soccer-ball-size eyes.This is by far the largest group in the animal kingdom: 97 percernt of all animals are invertebrates. So far. 1.25 million species have been described, most of which are insects, and there are millions more to be discovered. The total number of invertebrate species could be 5, 10, or even 30 million, com- pared to just 60,000 vertebrates.One reason for the success of inverfebrates is how quickiy they reproduce. Sponges and corals, for example, produce both eggs and sperm. Social insects such as ants and bees lay eggs that can develop without fertilization-they become the workers.Insects in.particulgr.gre successful because they are so adaptable. They are opportunistic eaters, feeding on plants, animals, and decayingorganic maferial. Ihey are.gble.to, survive in extreme environments, including very hot, dry habitats. And many can fly-either to escapepredators or fo find new sources of food, water, and shelter.Like vertebrates, inveriebrates are classified based upon their body structure, life cycle, and evolutionary history.QUESTION:ldentify the text structure used in the selection and give five (5) important key points. ​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Answer:In several products, eggs are used to form emulsions or foams. For example, eggs are used in salad dressings, e.g., mayonnaise, to stabilise an oil-in-water emulsion. In meringue and sponge cakes, the function of the egg is to stabilise the foam, i.e., the air in the liquid dispersion.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>Uses of egg</strong></p><p>ENHANCES THE NUTRITIONAL VALUE OF</p><p>OTHER FOODS</p><p>Eggs are rich in nutrients and by adding them to vegetables, pastas, wheat and bread, the nutritionally balanced meal when an egg is added.</p><p></p><p>RAISING AGENT</p><p>Whisked egg white includes air to form fine foam. The air bubbles expand with heat, as in sponge cakes, meringues or soufflés and thus acts as raising agent.</p><p></p><p>BINDING SUBSTANCE AND COATING</p><p>Because eggs set when heated, they bind loose crumbly ingredients together, for example in croquettes and fillings. By dipping fritters in beaten egg before frying, the surface is sealed which prevents the food from soaking up the oil in which it is fried.</p><p></p><p>THICKENING AGENTS</p><p>Whipped egg is used as thickening agent in pie fillings, custard sauces and baked custard. When heated for too long, however, liquid is discharged and the egg forms a sticky clot.</p><p></p><p>EMULSIFYING AGENT</p><p>Egg yolk keeps liquid like oil in an emulsion by encircling oil particles, thus preventing them from sticking together. mayonnaise is an excellent example. The addition of vinegar or lemon juice stabilises the emulsion.</p><p></p><p>GLAZING AND SEALING</p><p>Whisked egg white glazes baking beautifully. Raw pastry crust won't become mushy from the moisture in the filling if it is cooked with egg white before the filling is poured into it.</p><p></p><p>ADDING COLOUR AND FLAVOURING</p><p>The egg yolk gives cakes a very attractive colour. Eggs also enhance the flavour of any dish to which they are added.</p><br />

                            11. 1. Before clocks were made, people kept track of time by other means. In ancient Egypt, people used a water clock. Water dripped slowly from one clay pot into another. People measured time according to how long it took one pot to empty and the other one to fill. Candle clocks were common during the Middle Ages. As such, when a candle burned, marks on its side showed about how much time had passed. A final ancient way to measure time was the sundial, which used the movement of the sun across the sky. The shadows moving across the face of the sundial showed the current time.What is the main idea? a. As such, when a candle burned, marks on its side showed about how much time had passed b. Before clocks were made, people kept track by other means. c. In ancient Egypt, people used a water clock. d. All the above. 2. (1) One common example of instinct is the spider's spinning of its intricate web. (2) No one teaches a spider how to spin: its inborn instinct allows it to accomplish the task. (3) Another example of instinctive behavior is the salmon's struggle to swim upstream to lay eggs. (4) It would be much easier for the salmon to follow the current downstream, but instinct overrides all other considerations. (5) Instinct is clearly a strong influence on animal behavior.

                            13. About Invertebrates- Invertebrates are animals without a backbone or bony skeleton.They range in size from microscopic mites and almost invisible flies to giant squid with soccer-ball-size eyes.This is by far the largest group in the animal kingdom: 97 percernt of all animals are invertebrates. So far. 1.25 million species have been described, most of which are insects, and there are millions more to be discovered. The total number of invertebrate species could be 5, 10, or even 30 million, com- pared to just 60,000 vertebrates.One reason for the success of inverfebrates is how quickiy they reproduce. Sponges and corals, for example, produce both eggs and sperm. Social insects such as ants and bees lay eggs that can develop without fertilization-they become the workers.Insects in.particulgr.gre successful because they are so adaptable. They are opportunistic eaters, feeding on plants, animals, and decayingorganic maferial. Ihey are.gble.to, survive in extreme environments, including very hot, dry habitats. And many can fly-either to escapepredators or fo find new sources of food, water, and shelter.Like vertebrates, inveriebrates are classified based upon their body structure, life cycle, and evolutionary history.QUESTION:ldentify the text structure used in the selection and give five (5) important key points. ​</h2><br />

2. Many plants are sources of products that people use, including food 
items, fibers (for cloth), paper, paper, rubber, and medicines. They also 
provide some of our energy needs such as coal, oil for cooking, and fuel 
for cars (ethanol). In some parts of the work wood is used by people to 
cook their food and heat their homes.
3. The first thing we had to do was build a frame for the floor of the 
house. Then we used a rope to raise all the wood up into the 
tree. Afterward, we carefully nailed the board to the frame, and soon we 
had a floor.
4. Plants convert light energy from the sun into food. They produce the 
food that people and animals eat. The animals that give us such as 
chickens and cows eat grass, oats, corn, and other plants.

then condensing the water vapor from boiling water. Bacteria are 
removed by passing water through a filter. But the best way of purifying 
water at home is by boiling it. When water is boiled, the bacteria in it 
one surely killed.
