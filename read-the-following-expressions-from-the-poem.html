I love thee to the level of everyday's Most quict need, by sun and candle-light. I love thee frechy, as men strive for Right; I love thee purely, as they furn from Praise. I love thee with the passion put to use in my old griefs, and with iny childhood's faith. I love thee with a love l seemned to lose my lost saints, I love thee with the breath, Smiles, tears, of all my life!-and, if God choose, I shall but love thee befter after death. 1.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. I could feel the feeling of the speaker unending passion for her beloved. </p><p></p><p>2. Because the speaker is proclaiming her unending passion for her beloved. Even though death comes into the poem at the end as the speaker talks about the length and durability of their relationship. She hopes that God will allow her to love her partner even in death. </p><p></p><p>3. Intimate, loving and sincere</p><p></p><p>4. (I don't quite understand the question here.) </p><p></p><p>5. In the poem "How Do I Love Thee," Browning writes about the love she feels for him. It is a beautiful love poem. She goes into great detail about how much she does love him. "I love thee with the breadth, smiles, tears, of all my life; and, if God choose, I shall but love thee better after death."</p><p></p><p>6. Yes. Becuase From the poem's first lines, the speaker describes her love in terms that sound spiritual or religious. She asserts: “I love thee to the depth and breadth and height / My soul can reach.” You can feel the unending passion for love as you felt it to, to someone very special to you. (Think of someone that you can give your unending passion for love and describe it as what you felt for) </p><p></p><p>Hope this could help</p><br />

                            14. C. Assesstment/Application/Outputs Directions: Read the excerpt from the poem The Road Not Taken by Robert Frost and answer the questions that follow 3 Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, * And sorry I could not travel both And be one traveler, long I stood And looked down one as far as I could To where it bent in the undergrowth B I shall be telling this with a sigh Somewhere ages and ages hence: Two roads diverged in a wood, and I I took the one less traveled by, 10 And that has made all the difference. 1. What line in the poem expresses the poet's decision? 2. How does the line contribute to his purpose? 3. how does the line help you in making decisions? 4. what does the speaker mean in "and sorry I could not travel both"? 5. what type of choices do you think the road less traveled represents to the speaker?​</h2><br />
                        <p>Answer:</p><p>1. In the last two lines of the poem the poet tells that the road he opted for is less travelled.</p><p>2. You can use lines to convey movement and create texture. Lines provide emphasis and define shape. They can be used to convey mood and emotion.</p><p>3. ( I dont know )</p><p>4. It means that it is the limitation of a human being that one person can not take two paths even if both looks attractive so a choice has to be made. So, the poet says that I could not travel both.</p><p>5. The diverging roads may be read as being an extended metaphor for two kinds of life choices in general: the conventional versus the unconventional. By choosing the less-traveled path over the well-traveled path, the speaker suggests that he or she values individualism over conformity</p><p>Explanation:</p><p>Yan beh sana makatulong sayo</p><br />

                            15. II. Directions: Read the poem: "To Helen " by Edgar Allan Poe and answer thequestions that follow.To HelenBY EDGAR ALLAN POEHelen, thy beauty is to meLike those Nicéan barks of yore,That gently, o'er a perfumed sea,The weary, way-worn wanderer boreTo his own native shore.On desperate seas long wont to roam,Thy hyacinth hair, thy classic face,Thy Naiad airs have brought me homeTo the glory that was Greece,And the grandeur that was Rome.Lo! in yon brilliant window-nicheHow statue-like I see thee stand,The agate lamp within thy hand!Ah, Psyche, from the regions whichAre Holy-Land!1.Identify and write the line in the poem where the author makescomparison with flowers?2.Who do you think is the wanderer in the last two lines of the first stanza?3.What does the author trying to imply in these lines:Lo! in yon brilliant window-nicheLow statue-like I see thee stand,4.What is the tone of the poem as expressed by the author?5.Was the life of the author shown in the poem? In what way?6."To Helen" is a lyric poem extolling the beauty of a woman.Is this type ofexpressions still exist in our modern times? Why do you say so?please need kopo ng answer​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.	Identify and write the line in the poem where the author makes
</p><p>comparison with flowers?
</p><p>
</p><p>Answer:  Helen, thy beauty is to me  </p><p>Like those Nice'an barks of yore,
</p><p>-This line is like flowers whenever you see it, its makes beauty and nice to your eyes.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>2.Who do you think is the wanderer in the last two lines of the first stanza?
</p><p>Answer: It’s Helen.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>3.What does the author trying to imply in these lines:
</p><p>Lo! in yon brilliant window-niche
</p><p>Low statue-like I see thee stand,
</p><p>
</p><p>•	Answer: The speaker is floored by Helen's beauty as he sees her standing in the "window niche" (like a nook). Saying "Lo" is like saying OMG when you all of a sudden see something astonishing. Helen is standing "statue-like," which means both that she resembles a work of art and that she is not moving at all.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>4.What is the tone of the poem as expressed by the author?
</p><p>Answer: The tone of the poem is written in admiration in a heavenly and dreamy language towards the stellar features of the legendary Helen of Troy set in the picturesque ancient Greek where various aspects of creativity and theory developed. It also shows the underlying love Poe has for his first lady, Jane Stanard.
</p><p>
</p><p>5.Was the life of the author shown in the poem? In what way?
</p><p>Answer: Yes, it has shown there through his stanzas you could tell how he described Helen and how their lives together as well as his life being with Helen.
