Terminology helps students comprehend the main message of the research to transmit the content more effectively. It will be easier if the researcher is familiar with the mechanics in forming a good research title.
Guidelines in formulating research title:
1. The title needs to be very specific in nature.
2. In spite of being specific, it should also have the expressive power to show the entire scale of the research study in those few words.
3. It should tell the total nature of the subject.
4. It needs to be very definite and clear.
5. The title needs to be attractive and interesting enough to catch the attention of the readers.
Directions: Formulate a research title using the above guidelines from the issue you have 
 identified from the previous activity that can be used as your research topic.
Criteria 
Relevance of the Topic 5 points
Uniqueness of the Topic 5 points
Appropriateness of Elements 5 points
TOTAL 15 points

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The Covid-19 pandemic has greatly affected various aspects of normal life, including going to office and school. As a result, schools have been forced to forego traditional classes and shift to online classes instead.</p><p></p><p>Currently, conducting online classes is the only way out, to keep imparting knowledge. It involves the use of digital services to create a virtual classroom. The teacher and students sign into a communication app and sit in front of their devices. This new system did encounter a few hiccups initially, but things have been smoothened out.</p><p></p><p>The challenge for the teacher lies in maintaining class decorum, especially when it comes to unmuted microphones. Unwanted noise can disturb the entire class. Also, the teacher needs to peer at each child's video stream to ensure that the children are paying attention.</p><p></p><p>Further, since the children themselves are at home, in an informal environment, they find it easier to get distracted, especially since not everyone has sufficient space for family members on different online meetings. Yet, most students have been able to adapt and attend online classes with sincerity.</p><p></p><p>A very strong disadvantage of online classes is the lack of interaction with peers. However, fortunately today's generation has access to data networks and voice and video calls are possible with ease. Though it is not the same as face-to-face conversations, it allows students to interact with friends and even teachers. Teachers have gone out of the way to help students and are on duty practically all day.</p><p></p><p>Overall, online classes have their own set of challenges, including correcting notebooks virtually, but they have also brought out some qualities in everyone. Irrespective of whether one is a student or a teacher, one has to demonstrate greater patience levels, be more attentive and responsible than during traditional classes.</p><p><strong>Explaination</strong><strong>:</strong></p><p><strong>#</strong><strong>I</strong><strong> </strong><strong>HOPE</strong><strong> </strong><strong>IT</strong><strong> </strong><strong>HELPSSS</strong><strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>#</strong><strong>B</strong><strong>R</strong><strong>A</strong><strong>I</strong><strong>N</strong><strong>L</strong><strong>I</strong><strong>E</strong><strong>S</strong><strong>T</strong><strong>B</strong><strong>U</strong><strong>N</strong><strong>C</strong><strong>H</strong><strong>!</strong></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The Covid-19 pandemic has greatly affected various aspects of normal life, including going to office and school. As a result, schools have been forced to forego traditional classes and shift to online classes instead.
</p><p>
</p><p>Currently, conducting online classes is the only way out, to keep imparting knowledge. It involves the use of digital services to create a virtual classroom. The teacher and students sign into a communication app and sit in front of their devices. This new system did encounter a few hiccups initially, but things have been smoothened out.
</p><p>
</p><p>The challenge for the teacher lies in maintaining class decorum, especially when it comes to unmuted microphones. Unwanted noise can disturb the entire class. Also, the teacher needs to peer at each child's video stream to ensure that the children are paying attention.
</p><p>
</p><p>Further, since the children themselves are at home, in an informal environment, they find it easier to get distracted, especially since not everyone has sufficient space for family members on different online meetings. Yet, most students have been able to adapt and attend online classes with sincerity.
</p><p>
</p><p>A very strong disadvantage of online classes is the lack of interaction with peers. However, fortunately today's generation has access to data networks and voice and video calls are possible with ease. Though it is not the same as face-to-face conversations, it allows students to interact with friends and even teachers. Teachers have gone out of the way to help students and are on duty practically all day.
</p><p>
</p><p>Overall, online classes have their own set of challenges, including correcting notebooks virtually, but they have also brought out some qualities in everyone. Irrespective of whether one is a student or a teacher, one has to demonstrate greater patience levels, be more attentive and responsible than during traditional classes.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong>online learning</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>Topic: <strong>Life </strong><strong>before and during the advent of COVID-19</strong></p><p></p><p>COVID-19 brought many challenges in our lives. Its impact goes through other sectors including our livelihood as well as health, economy, and education. The proliferation of fatality rates associated with this disease has altered not only businessmen and private individuals, but is rather an issue that concerns the government in general. In response, various programs were implemented at the local, regional, and provincial levels as precautionary or preventive measures to address the problem. Among these are swab testing, massive vaccination, provision of quarantine facilities, and placing various areas into Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ) as well.</p><p></p><p>In order to reduce contagion, a lockdown was imposed on us. The whole nation was astonished. It has decimated jobs and placed millions of livelihoods at risk. The situation also led most to anxiety and dilemma. Panic buying was emerged throughout varying places, particularly in the Philippines. A few months after the first confirmed COVID-19 case in the country, the Malacañang suddenly declared to put high-risk areas in the country under enhanced community quarantine (ECQ). By then, all social activities were postponed. Citizens were required to stay home except for emergencies and primary needs. Quarantine passes were supplied and allocated by the government to an individual in each house and permits them to go out for an appropriate reason. It was tough.</p><p></p><p>I was devastated, upset, and ecstatic at the same time. I felt bad for the people who were going through a lot in the course of the disease outbreak. Although, I thought to myself, how difficult could staying at home be? Well, it was easy, not until the reality of the situation began to sink in into my mind. I started to miss my “pre-COVID” activities. I also had to put a dot in socializing with other people, aside from my family. There was definitely plenty of which the lockdown changed or worse, damaged. </p><p></p><p>However, over time, I became used to the new living system. I realized that the lockdown was actually an advantage to take a short break from work and value every little things in life. It was also an opportunity for us to spend time with our loved ones. Yes, those times were challenging, despair was all around, but eventually we found a way out of it. As the world now starts to come on track again, it is important to understand and appreciate the life lessons which the period of lockdown has given us.</p><p></p><p>sorry for the unorganized spacing ^^</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>ano ba sagot jan di ko rin alam eh</p><br />

                            18. think of a familiar topic or issue you may use as a subject in writing repository essay in online learning​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The Covid-19 pandemic has greatly affected various aspects of normal life, including going to office and school. As a result, schools have been forced to forego traditional classes and shift to online classes instead.
</p><p>
</p><p>Currently, conducting online classes is the only way out, to keep imparting knowledge. It involves the use of digital services to create a virtual classroom. The teacher and students sign into a communication app and sit in front of their devices. This new system did encounter a few hiccups initially, but things have been smoothened out.
</p><p>
</p><p>The challenge for the teacher lies in maintaining class decorum, especially when it comes to unmuted microphones. Unwanted noise can disturb the entire class. Also, the teacher needs to peer at each child's video stream to ensure that the children are paying attention.
</p><p>
</p><p>Further, since the children themselves are at home, in an informal environment, they find it easier to get distracted, especially since not everyone has sufficient space for family members on different online meetings. Yet, most students have been able to adapt and attend online classes with sincerity.
</p><p>
</p><p>A very strong disadvantage of online classes is the lack of interaction with peers. However, fortunately today's generation has access to data networks and voice and video calls are possible with ease. Though it is not the same as face-to-face conversations, it allows students to interact with friends and even teachers. Teachers have gone out of the way to help students and are on duty practically all day.
</p><p>
</p><p>Overall, online classes have their own set of challenges, including correcting notebooks virtually, but they have also brought out some qualities in everyone. Irrespective of whether one is a student or a teacher, one has to demonstrate greater patience levels, be more attentive and responsible than during traditional classes.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />
