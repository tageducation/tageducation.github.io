                                            THE FREE BIRD AND THE CAGE BIRD
The tame bird was in a cage; the free bird was in the forest.
They met when the time came, it was a decree of fate.
The free bird cries, 'O my love, let us fly to the wood.'
The cage bird whispers, 'Come hither, let us both live in the cage.'
Says the free bird, 'Among bars, where is there room to spread one's wings?'
'Alas,' cries the caged bird, 'I should not know where to sit perched in the sky.'
The free bird cries, 'My darling, sing the songs of the woodlands.'
The cage bird sings, 'Sit by my side, I'll teach you the speech of the learned.'
The forest bird cries, 'No, ah no! songs can never be taught.'
The cage bird says, 'Alas for me, I know not the songs of the woodlands.'
There love is intense with longing, but they never can fly wing to wing.
Through the bars of the cage they look, and vain is their wish to know each
other.
They flutter their wings in yearning, and sing, 'Come closer, my love!'
The free bird cries, 'It cannot be, I fear the closed doors of the cage.'
The cage bird whispers, 'Alas, my wings are powerless and dead.

STORM Jaime Jesus Borlagdan This is the weight stripped off by the sky mixed are the earth and water.If the disorder will be put back in place or traced, It would be like peeling away from a sticky embrace.Twisted are the limbs of electricity and branches, broken by strain slumped at each other.The leaves, the pebbles which tore the windows.Scratches, sap were the solidified tracks.Marks of the gushing path Of the ocean which walked the earth,Last night under the twister moon Whose beam was inward to its own gloom. The embrace of the Habagat, south wind, was a whipping tight Brutal pressure whose desire is to devour The world in one clenched hand. Almost without fear, almost close to be like love Which enveloped all. On the roads, in the veins The waited which was met By anxiety Wafted like untamed horses, At the clearing of dust The morning was a crumpled sheet. Remained was the soil naked. There in the falling of the flower To the dirt which nursed the root, Bloomed the scent Of the trampled upon grass. In the surfacing of light Clarity again is formed. In the shattered container this alone Is what is kept In the long digging This is what's in the pit. 1. What is the poem about? 2. How did find reading the poem? 3. How did the author describe the aftermath of the storm? 4. If you were the author, are you also going to illustrate the situation after a storm in same way? Why or why not? 5. How is his poem significant to the lives of the Bicolanos?​</a>

                                            A Christian female student met a Jewish male student at university in Canada. They were both from the same country, and shared many interests and truly loved each other. They felt they could overcome their religious differences. However, both sets of parents forbade them to get married. The Christian parents knew that followers of Judaism did not believe the same things about Jesus, who they felt was the most important person in Christian history. The Jewish parents did not trust the Christians. How would an ethnocentric person and a cultural relativist respond to this issue? Example: You are being asked to try crickets. Ethnocentric Response - It's weird and gross! Cultural Relativist Response - I haven't tried eating crickets. Can you tell me why you like them?

                                            Why There is High Tide during a Full Moon
Long, long ago only gods lived in this world, the earth, seas, and sky were ruled by three different powerful gods.
The sun god, who ruled the sky, had a very beautiful daughter, Luna, the moon. Luna enjoyed going around the heavens in her golden chariot. One day she found herself taking another path which led her outside her kingdom. She wandered on until she reached the place where the sky met the sea. Beautiful and unusual sights greeted her eyes. As she was admiring the beautiful things around, a voice startled her. It asked, "Where has thou come from, most beautiful one?"
Turning around she saw a young man who looked much like her father though fairer. She wanted to run away, but when she looked at him again, she saw that he was smiling at her. Taking courage she answered, "I am Luna, daughter of the sun god."
The young man smiled at her and answered, "I am Mar, the son of the sea god. Welcome to our kingdom." Soon the two became good friends. They had many interesting stories to tell each other. When it was time for Luna to go, they promised to see each other as often as they could, for they has many more tales to tell. They continued meeting at the same spot until they realized that they were in love with each other.
One day after one of their secret meetings, Luna went back to the heavens full of joy. She was so happy that she told her secret to one of her cousins. The cousin, jealous of her beauty and her happiness, reported the affair to the sun god. The sun god was angered at his daughter's disobedience to the immortal laws. He shut her in their garden and did not allow her to get out. Then he sent a messenger to the sea god informing him that his son Mar disobeyed the immortal law. The sea god, who was also angered by his son's disobedience, imprisoned him in one of his sea caves.
Luna stayed in the garden for sometime. She was very sad at not being able to see Mar. She longed to be with him again. Feeling very restless one day, she escaped from the garden. She took her golden chariot and rushed to their meeting place. Mar, who was imprisoned in the sea cave, saw her reflection on the water. He wanted to get out to meet her. He tried hard to get out of his cave causing unrest in the sea. Luna waited for Mar to appear, but he did not come. Then she went back home very sad. Each time she remembered Mar, she would rush out in the golden chariot to the meeting place in hopes of seeing him again.
The fishermen out in the sea believe that each time Luna, the moon, appears, the sea gets troubled. "It is Mar trying to escape from his cave," they say.

He knew that she had found out where the crocodile and the lady were, and he asked with his eyes, "Which one?" She quickly lifted her hand to the right. The young man approached the door on the right. He had no idea what was held inside, but either would make him unhappy. He only wanted the princess. He slowly opened the door.

                            13. THE FREE BIRD AND THE CAGE BIRD
The tame bird was in a cage; the free bird was in the forest.
They met when the time came, it was a decree of fate.
The free bird cries, 'O my love, let us fly to the wood.'
The cage bird whispers, 'Come hither, let us both live in the cage.'
Says the free bird, 'Among bars, where is there room to spread one's wings?'
'Alas,' cries the caged bird, 'I should not know where to sit perched in the sky.'
The free bird cries, 'My darling, sing the songs of the woodlands.'
The cage bird sings, 'Sit by my side, I'll teach you the speech of the learned.'
The forest bird cries, 'No, ah no! songs can never be taught.'
The cage bird says, 'Alas for me, I know not the songs of the woodlands.'
There love is intense with longing, but they never can fly wing to wing.
Through the bars of the cage they look, and vain is their wish to know each
other.
They flutter their wings in yearning, and sing, 'Come closer, my love!'
The free bird cries, 'It cannot be, I fear the closed doors of the cage.'
The cage bird whispers, 'Alas, my wings are powerless and dead.

Student: Hello ma'am, I'm okay, thank you. Yes ma'am, I'm a transferee from Cagayan Valley. Teacher: Why did you transfer here? Student: My parents are settling here for good ma'am. My father's family are here. Teacher:I heard people from Cagayan Valley are mostly inhabited by Ilokano. And they're known to be "kuripot" accordingly. Is this true? Student:Yes ma'am, but I can't affirm nor deny your statement because Ilocanos are just the same with other tribes. They portray different set of values and culture. Teacher:okay. Thank you and welcome to our school._____________________________________________________________________________________. B. A dialogue between two friendsFRIEND A: You know my friend, I really love to watch Korean Movies. The actors and actress are so  cute and adorable.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The first dialogue shows the prejudice of the teacher towards the transferred student. The teacher said that the Ilocanos are known as kuripot, or cheap in the English language, which clearly shows a prejudice. The teacher "knows" that the Ilocanos from the Cagayan valley are cheap and asked a question afterwards if it was true. The teacher has no experience of the Ilocanos being cheap and has shown that the teacher's knowledge of the Ilocanos is merely steroetyped, one of the most well-known prejudices that exists.</p><p></p><br />

what message can you draw from the information that you gathered from parents or the couples?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>answer:</strong></p><p><strong>for the first question:</strong><strong> </strong><strong>because they know each other well and they trust each other they also share thoughts about something or someone that’s why they like or love each others.</strong></p><p><strong>second question:</strong><strong> To other couples, they may have started their relationship with courtship or dating. This the stage when you get to know the other person's objective. Some could get to know the other person really well, but during this stage, the assurance to be committed depends on whether both would agree on. Mostly, during courtship and dating, the man always puts his best foot forward. They can eat out every night, watch movies together, travel, and talk about the next level of relationship they could get into.Well, for me, the foundation of marriage should be friendship, not just because this is the strongest kind of relationship but it's because you can show the other person who you really is. The person would accept the imperfections of the other one and wouldn't expect the other person to change. </strong></p><p><strong>third question: </strong><strong>Yes. Because courtship and dating are the most important element in finding the right one. In this way you can truly know what is the color or the true attitude of your partner. If he/she can be the best or not. Choosing your life partner is one of the most important decisions you'll make in your life.</strong></p><p><strong>fourth question:</strong><strong> courtship is important for them to know each other better</strong></p><strong></strong><br />

STORM Jaime Jesus Borlagdan This is the weight stripped off by the sky mixed are the earth and water.If the disorder will be put back in place or traced, It would be like peeling away from a sticky embrace.Twisted are the limbs of electricity and branches, broken by strain slumped at each other.The leaves, the pebbles which tore the windows.Scratches, sap were the solidified tracks.Marks of the gushing path Of the ocean which walked the earth,Last night under the twister moon Whose beam was inward to its own gloom. The embrace of the Habagat, south wind, was a whipping tight Brutal pressure whose desire is to devour The world in one clenched hand. Almost without fear, almost close to be like love Which enveloped all. On the roads, in the veins The waited which was met By anxiety Wafted like untamed horses, At the clearing of dust The morning was a crumpled sheet. Remained was the soil naked. There in the falling of the flower To the dirt which nursed the root, Bloomed the scent Of the trampled upon grass. In the surfacing of light Clarity again is formed. In the shattered container this alone Is what is kept In the long digging This is what's in the pit. 1. What is the poem about? 2. How did find reading the poem? 3.

                            28. Why There is High Tide during a Full Moon
Long, long ago only gods lived in this world, the earth, seas, and sky were ruled by three different powerful gods.
The sun god, who ruled the sky, had a very beautiful daughter, Luna, the moon. Luna enjoyed going around the heavens in her golden chariot. One day she found herself taking another path which led her outside her kingdom. She wandered on until she reached the place where the sky met the sea. Beautiful and unusual sights greeted her eyes. As she was admiring the beautiful things around, a voice startled her. It asked, "Where has thou come from, most beautiful one?"
Turning around she saw a young man who looked much like her father though fairer. She wanted to run away, but when she looked at him again, she saw that he was smiling at her. Taking courage she answered, "I am Luna, daughter of the sun god."
The young man smiled at her and answered, "I am Mar, the son of the sea god. Welcome to our kingdom." Soon the two became good friends. They had many interesting stories to tell each other. When it was time for Luna to go, they promised to see each other as often as they could, for they has many more tales to tell. They continued meeting at the same spot until they realized that they were in love with each other.
One day after one of their secret meetings, Luna went back to the heavens full of joy. She was so happy that she told her secret to one of her cousins. The cousin, jealous of her beauty and her happiness, reported the affair to the sun god. The sun god was angered at his daughter's disobedience to the immortal laws. He shut her in their garden and did not allow her to get out. Then he sent a messenger to the sea god informing him that his son Mar disobeyed the immortal law. The sea god, who was also angered by his son's disobedience, imprisoned him in one of his sea caves.
Luna stayed in the garden for sometime. She was very sad at not being able to see Mar. She longed to be with him again. Feeling very restless one day, she escaped from the garden. She took her golden chariot and rushed to their meeting place. Mar, who was imprisoned in the sea cave, saw her reflection on the water. He wanted to get out to meet her. He tried hard to get out of his cave causing unrest in the sea. Luna waited for Mar to appear, but he did not come. Then she went back home very sad. Each time she remembered Mar, she would rush out in the golden chariot to the meeting place in hopes of seeing him again.
The fishermen out in the sea believe that each time Luna, the moon, appears, the sea gets troubled. "It is Mar trying to escape from his cave," they say.
