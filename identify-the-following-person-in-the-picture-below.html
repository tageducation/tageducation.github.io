B. Subject Covered: Math
Directions/Instructions:
1. Read and understand the given scenario and fill out the table with the required
data below.
2. Follow the procedure carefully to get the desired result.
Shopping Spree
The students of Nemesio I. Yabut Elementary School will be shopping for their immediate
families for this project! It doesn’t matter what your background is or in what you believe.
It is always a great feeling to give back to your favorite people.
Your objective:
Purchase gifts for your immediate family with a budget of Php 10, 000.00
Procedure:
1. Identify and list each member of your household by name and age. The age is
important so that your gift is appropriate. Any person over 18 years of age should
be identified by “adult”.
2. Budget the amount you can spend on each family member. Take Php 10, 000 and
divide it amongst the number of people in your immediate family (not including
yourself). This will represent the amount of money you can spend on each person.
For example, if there are 12 people in your family, you want to know what 1/12 of
Php 10, 000 is. You can do that by dividing Php 10,000 ÷ 12).
3. Write the budgeted amount for each person next to their name using a table.
4. Search the internet using a variety of websites (Lazada, Shoppee, etc.) to find a gift
for each member. Make sure to capture the picture or do a print screen of your gift
to prove your price. Paste them below.
5. List each gift and the price on the table
6. Total the amount spent after you have selected your gifts for every family member.
7. Check your total to make sure that you have stayed within your budget.

A. Title: Shopping Spree
B. Subject Covered: Math
Directions/Instructions:
1. Read and understand the given scenario and fill out the table with the required
data below.
2. Follow the procedure carefully to get the desired result.
Shopping Spree
The students of Nemesio I. Yabut Elementary School will be shopping for their immediate
families for this project! It doesn’t matter what your background is or in what you believe.
It is always a great feeling to give back to your favorite people.
Your objective:
Purchase gifts for your immediate family with a budget of Php 10, 000.00
Procedure:
1. Identify and list each member of your household by name and age. The age is
important so that your gift is appropriate. Any person over 18 years of age should
be identified by “adult”.
2. Budget the amount you can spend on each family member. Take Php 10, 000 and
divide it amongst the number of people in your immediate family (not including
yourself). This will represent the amount of money you can spend on each person.
For example, if there are 12 people in your family, you want to know what 1/12 of
Php 10, 000 is. You can do that by dividing Php 10,000 ÷ 12).
3. Write the budgeted amount for each person next to their name using a table.
4. Search the internet using a variety of websites (Lazada, Shoppee, etc.) to find a gift
for each member. Make sure to capture the picture or do a print screen of your gift
to prove your price. Paste them below.
5. List each gift and the price on the table
6. Total the amount spent after you have selected your gifts for every family member.
7. Check your total to make sure that you have stayed within your budget.
