Refers to the resistance of a liquid to flow.  4.	Is temperature at which the liquid starts to boil.  5.	Defined as the pressure exerted by a substance when in its gaseous state. 6.	The ability of a substance to be dissolved in another substance to form a solution.  7.

The floating of ice on liquid water is an indication that ice has higher density    than liquid water. 12.	The volatility of a substance depends on its vapor pressure.  13.	Alcohol is less volatile than vinegar.  14.	Between water (H2O) and carbon tetrachloride (CCl4), water has higher boiling     point. 15.	Vapor pressure is inversely proportional to the strength of intermolecular   forces present.  ​</h2><br />
