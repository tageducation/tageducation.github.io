                                            Objective In this activity, you should be able to describe in words the position of an object Procedure Describing through visuals The position of an object can be described in many ways. You can use words, like what you did in Activity 1. You can also use visuals, like diagrams or graphs, Use the examples to explore how these help in providing accurate descriptions of positions of objects. Using diagrams Consider the diagram in Figure 1. The positions of the objects are described in the diagram by their coordinates along the number line. 40 Figure 1 Q1. What is the position of the dog? -10 Q2. What is the position of the tree? 5m Q3. What is the position of the dog with respect to the house? 10m Q4. What is the position of the tree with respect to the dog? Here is another example. In this diagram, the positions of the ball rolling are shown at equal intervals of time. You can use the diagram to describe the position of the ball at any given time. 00 01 Figure 1 Where Is It? Q5. What is the initial position of the ball? Q6. What is its final position? 27. What is the position of the ball at 10 seconds? 28. At what time is the position of the ball equal to 3 meters? Using graphs Another way to describe the motion of the ball is by the use of motion graphs. Convert the diagram in Figure 2 to graph by following the guide below. I. Fill up Table 1 using the data in Figure 2. Note that the positions of the ball are shown every 5 seconds. Table 0 Position of the ball vs time Position of the ball (m) II. Plot the values in Table 1 as points on the graph in Figure 3. Note that time is plotted on the X-axis while position is plotted on the Y-axis. ACTIVITY #3 Fun Walk Objective In this activity you should be able to gather data to determine who walks fastest. Procedure 1. In a spacious place, mark on the ground the starting line for walking 2. All participants must start walking from the starting line upon receiving the go signal. 3. Participants must start to walk as fast as they could. The other members should observe closely as the participants walk and determine who walks fastest 5. Collect and record data to support your conclusion. Time Speed Name Distance Q1. What quantities did you measure for your data? Q2. How did you combine these quantities to determine how fast each participant was walking? Q3. How did you use the result to determine who walked fastest? Q4. At constant distance, how is speed related to the time of travel? Q5. At constant time to travel, how is speed related to the distance travelled? Q6. Who was travelling faster than the other, a person who covered 10 meters in 5 seconds or the one wh took 10 seconds to cover 20 meters?​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>1.  The packet of my dog 2. Making it seem likes it's our idea  when its isn't 3. Distance for leap of dog is 2m against 1m long leap of the dog , if the dog makes two leaps to the dog , three at what distance from A ,will  the dog catch up = 20 m4. A  straigth line path of the initial and final position of body =5m 5. Since the dog has comeback to its starting positions ,its displacements is zero and the solutions is (10 m to starting points, final point =0m displacements 6.  yes The displacements can be zero even if the distance is not zero and Circular motion of body result in zero displacements is cannot be zero 7. The  distance travelled is the path taken by a body to get from an initial point to an , end point in a given period of time , at a certains velocity if the velocity is constant : DISTANCE = TIME ^ VLOCITY = 15m 8.When the motion of the body is towards the initials position9. No,The only way that the displacements and distance for motions of the same objects, over the same time period would be equal and would be if the motion is in a straigth line.10.A Single displacements reaction, also known  as a single replacements all simple reactions , are single displacements  its representative of compounds <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><strong>UP TO 14 PO YAN hehe or kung up to 8 yan  lang okay lang </strong>sana makatulong pa brainlest nalang poe # hope its help    love u HAHA CHOOSS   iam a boy and iam not girl ,    ginagamit kolang po itong acc ng , haha nevermind  # see you soon<br />

                            8. Objective In this activity, you should be able to describe in words the position of an object Procedure Describing through visuals The position of an object can be described in many ways. You can use words, like what you did in Activity 1. You can also use visuals, like diagrams or graphs, Use the examples to explore how these help in providing accurate descriptions of positions of objects. Using diagrams Consider the diagram in Figure 1. The positions of the objects are described in the diagram by their coordinates along the number line. 40 Figure 1 Q1. What is the position of the dog? -10 Q2. What is the position of the tree? 5m Q3. What is the position of the dog with respect to the house? 10m Q4. What is the position of the tree with respect to the dog? Here is another example. In this diagram, the positions of the ball rolling are shown at equal intervals of time. You can use the diagram to describe the position of the ball at any given time. 00 01 Figure 1 Where Is It? Q5. What is the initial position of the ball? Q6. What is its final position? 27. What is the position of the ball at 10 seconds? 28. At what time is the position of the ball equal to 3 meters? Using graphs Another way to describe the motion of the ball is by the use of motion graphs. Convert the diagram in Figure 2 to graph by following the guide below. I. Fill up Table 1 using the data in Figure 2. Note that the positions of the ball are shown every 5 seconds. Table 0 Position of the ball vs time Position of the ball (m) II. Plot the values in Table 1 as points on the graph in Figure 3. Note that time is plotted on the X-axis while position is plotted on the Y-axis. ACTIVITY #3 Fun Walk Objective In this activity you should be able to gather data to determine who walks fastest. Procedure 1. In a spacious place, mark on the ground the starting line for walking 2. All participants must start walking from the starting line upon receiving the go signal. 3. Participants must start to walk as fast as they could. The other members should observe closely as the participants walk and determine who walks fastest 5. Collect and record data to support your conclusion. Time Speed Name Distance Q1. What quantities did you measure for your data? Q2. How did you combine these quantities to determine how fast each participant was walking? Q3. How did you use the result to determine who walked fastest? Q4. At constant distance, how is speed related to the time of travel? Q5. At constant time to travel, how is speed related to the distance travelled? Q6. Who was travelling faster than the other, a person who covered 10 meters in 5 seconds or the one wh took 10 seconds to cover 20 meters?​</h2><br />
