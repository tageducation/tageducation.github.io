                        <p>1. DO SOMETHING YOU BELIEVE IN</p><p>The first tip on our list is to try to improve in the area you really believe is important. Why did we say that? Well, it turns out that people need a big motive in order to stay focused long-term. </p><p></p><p>2. FOCUS ON IMPORTANT TASKS</p><p>We bet you can think of dozens of self-improvement goals. From learning languages to computer programming, everybody wants to advance in a number of different ways. However, we recommend you focus on important tasks only.</p><p></p><p>3. BE REALISTIC</p><p>It’s okay to dream of big achievements, but only if you really think it could happen. Don’t waste your time on goals that are impossible to reach when there are so many other things you can do in your life.</p><p></p><p></p><p>4. WRITE IT DOWN</p><p>It may sound strange, but writing down your plans gives you a much higher chance of converting on them vs. just talking about your wishes. It’s a small but notable psychological trick that helps you to narrow down the options and concentrate on concrete actions. At the same time, a written plan gives you clear milestones to follow, so you simply cannot lose focus somewhere in the process.</p><p></p><p>5. BREAK IT UP</p><p>Now that you have a plan, you should take an extra step and break larger tasks into a series of smaller units. Mark Baines, a lifecoach at Aussie writing, claims that people are afraid of huge projects: “This usually leads to negative reactions and procrastination. ”</p><p></p><p> </p><p>6. MAKE A CALENDAR OF ACTIVITIES</p><p>Another way to achieve goals faster is to make a calendar of activities. Create your own personal planner to avoid procrastination and make sure that you cover every little aspect of your project in a timely manner.</p><p></p><p>7. TELL YOUR FRIENDS OR FAMILY</p><p>Sometimes, we all need a little support from the people around us to get the job done faster and more effectively. That’s why you should tell your friends or family about your self-improvement plans. </p><p></p><p>8. LOOK FOR PROFESSIONAL HELP</p><p>This tip goes hand-in-hand with the previous one. If you are entering uncharted territory, perhaps you could look for professional help, too.</p><p></p><p>9. TAKE A BREAK</p><p>Consistency is critical if you want to achieve goals faster, but don’t forget to take a break occasionally. Don’t consider it a waste of time, but rather think of it as a natural part of the process. </p><p></p><p> </p><p>10.VISUALIZE SUCCESS</p><p>Visualization is a powerful psychological technique that helps top-performers to achieve their goals. The technique is particularly popular among athletes, but you can use it in all other fields of work just as well. </p><p></p><p>brainliest</p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><br />
