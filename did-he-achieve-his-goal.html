                        1. Beowulf went to Heorot because he heard what Grendel had been doing to the people in Heorot. He wanted to save Hrothgar's people and he might have wanted to test his skills and bravery so he went to Heorot to prove that he could beat Grendel.<br /><br />2. He achieved his goal, slayed Grendel and proved himself. He wanted to kill Grendel with bare hands and save Hrothgar's people and he did.<br /><br />3. He managed to escape and went back to his cave while injured from his battle with Beowulf. Grendel's mother saw the state his son was in so she, driven with anger, went to Heorot to avenge his son's defeat. She was defeated by Beowulf and he eventually killed Grendel then brought their heads back to Heorot.<br /><br />4. King Hrothgar presented Beowulf with gifts as a token of gratitude for helping them get rid of the evil monster that were terrorizing him and his people for twelve years. He gifted him an embroidered banner, breast-mail, an embossed helmet, and a sword. Last, but definitely not the least, Hrothgar gives Beowulf eight horses with gold bridles, one of which has a fancy saddle designed for a king in battle.<br /><br />5. The epic and the movie were very different. In comparison, the epic was a lot better but the movie version was good too. There were a lot of differences between the movie and the epic such as the fact that Grendel's mother was Angelina Jolie in the movie and he (Beowulf) lied about killing her.<br /><br /><br />

A hero of the Geats, comes to the aid of Hroðgar, the king
of the Danes, whose mead hall in Heorot has been under attack by a monster
known as Grendel. After Beowulf slays him, Grendel's mother attacks the hall
and is then also defeated. Victorious, Beowulf goes home to Geatland (Götaland
in modern Sweden) and later becomes king of the Geats. After a period of fifty
years has passed, Beowulf defeats a dragon, but is fatally wounded in the
battle. After his death, his attendants bury him in a tumulus, a burial mound,
in Geatland.

<br /><br />Beowulf's battle between Grendel:<br />

Beowulf and his men spend the night in Heorot. Beowulf
refuses to use any weapon because he holds himself to be the equal of Grendel.During
the battle, Beowulf has been feigning sleep and leaps up to clench Grendel's
hand. The two battle until it seems as though the hall might collapse.
Beowulf's retainers draw their swords and rush to his aid, but their blades
cannot pierce Grendel's skin. Finally, Beowulf tears Grendel's arm from his
body at the shoulder and Grendel runs to his home in the marshes and slowly
dies.

<br /><br />(The second battle is between Grendel's mother and the third battle was the slaying of the dragon.)<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
