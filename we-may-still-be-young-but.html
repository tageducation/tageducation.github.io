Although I disagree with much that those who oppose animal testing say, I fully endorsetheir final conclusion that there are many better alternatives to animal testing. The Foodand Drug Administration has stated that they support the development and use ofalternatives to animal testing.

Compare the views of the author.From an essay...Respect is the first positive step in building a relationship and relationships are central to conflict transformation. One does not have to like a person or understand his viewpoint to accord him respect. Respect comes with the belief that a person or culture can have beliefs contradictory to ours and we should still honor them, as basic respect is a fundamental right of all human beings. In addition, goals and concessions become easier to attain when the element of respect is present As Bill Richardson, the US permanent representative to the UN put it. "You have to be a human being. You cannot be arrogant... If you treat each individual with respect, each nation with dignity, you can get a lot further than trying to muscle them". ""Excerpt quoted from. Respect by Sana Farid https://www.beyondintractability.org/essay/respectFrom a research paper...eeWe believe that respectful children and adolescents tend to become respectful, civil, and tolerant adults. Conversely, we assume that the origins of incivility, disrespect, intolerance, and other problems of adults are formed in childhood and adolescence. For example, lacking respect for parents or authorities, a young child may not be receptive to what one can learn at home or at school. Brought up to disrespect other people based on social status or race, a child may become prejudiced. With a lack of respect for oneself, an adolescent may develop a negative self-concept and a lack of respect for others. Growing up with disrespect for older people, a young adult may be unable to keep a job in the work world that requires understanding the authority of others. Respect and disrespect indeed have relevance across the entire life span, for instance, in respect for the elderly and respect for the dignity of the dying.""Excerpt quoted from: Research and Theory on Respect and Disrespect: Catching Up with the Public and Practitioners by David W.

                                            paki sagutan Ang nasa picture Ladies and gentlemen,Teenage pregnancy is a serious issue that affects not only the young mother and father, but also their families and society as a whole. It is important that we address this issue and work to prevent teenage pregnancies.First of all, teenage pregnancy can have negative effects on the health of the mother and the baby. Pregnancy at a young age can increase the risk of complications such as preterm labor, low birth weight, and lack of prenatal care. It is also important to consider the emotional and psychological effects of teenage pregnancy. Many young mothers face social stigma, financial stress, and difficulty in completing their education.Secondly, teenage pregnancy can also have economic consequences. Raising a child is a significant financial burden, and it can be especially difficult for young parents who are still in school or have limited job prospects. The cost of raising a child can have a long-term impact on the parents' financial stability and their ability to provide for their family.Finally, teenage pregnancy can also have societal consequences. It can lead to a cycle of poverty and underachievement, as young parents may struggle to complete their education and secure good jobs. This can have a ripple effect, as their children may also face challenges in their own education and future prospects.In conclusion, teenage pregnancy is a complex issue that requires a multifaceted approach to prevention and support. We must work together to provide young people with the education, resources, and support they need to make informed and responsible decisions about their sexual health. Thank you.​</a>

Text #1 It is physically impossible for a well-educated, intellectual, or brave man to make money the chief object of his thoughts just as it is for him to make his dinner the principal object of them. All healthy people like their dinners, but their dinner is not the main object of their lives. So all healthy minded people like making money ought to like it and enjoy the sensation of winning it; it is something better than money. A good soldier, for instance, mainly wishes to do his fighting well. He is glad of his pay-very properly so and justly grumbles when you keep him ten years without it-till, his main mission of life is to win battles, not to be paid for winning them. So of clergymen. The clergyman's object is essentially baptize and preach not to be paid for preaching. So of doctors. They like fees no doubt-ought to like them; yet if they are brave and well-educated the entire object to their lives is not fees. They on the whole, desire to cure the sick; and if they are good doctors and 26 Summary a Precis and the choice were fairly to them, would rather cure their patient and lose their fee than kill him and get it. And so with all the other brave and rightly trained men: their work is first, their fee second-very important always; but still second.  Text #2 Home is the young, who known "nothing of the world and who would be forlorn and sad, if thrown upon it. It is providential, shelter of the weak and inexperienced, who have to learn as yet to cope with the temptations which lies outside of it. It is the place of training of those who are not only ignorant, but have no yet learnt how to learn, and who have to be taught by careful individual trail, how to set about profiting by the lessons of teacher. And it is the school of elementary studies-not of advances, for such studies alone can make master minds. Moreover, it is the shrine of our best affections, the bosom of our fondest recollections, at spell upon our after life, a stay for world weary mind and soul; wherever we are, till the end comes. Such are attributes or offices of home, and like to these, in one or other sense or measure, are the attributes and offices of a college in a university.  Text #3 Teaching is the noblest of professions. A teacher has a sacred duty to perform. It is he on whom rests the responsibility of moulding the character of young children. Apart from developing their intellect, he can inculcate in them qualities of good citizenship, remaining neat and clean, talking decently and sitting properly. These virtues are not easy to be imbibed. Only he who himself leads a life of simplicity, purity and rigid discipline can successfully cultivate these habits in his pupils.

Explain the possible causes of successes or failures of these goals. 1. In this critical period of our history, we need the heart, the soul, and  the vigor of the youth of our land to help us build our country on the  most enduring basis of brotherhood and solidarity of all Filipinos.  2. The youth of the land may be not only a strong factor in supporting this  government and in making this Republic an enduring nation but also  so that with the help and cooperation and loyalty of the Filipino youth,  we may be in a position to transmit as a heritage to future generations  a country, a people, compact and united in the bonds of a common  affection. 3. As ye sow, so shall ye reap. Are the Filipino young men and women of  today sowing the seeds of peace and prosperity so that they will reap  the fruits of progress and tranquility? 4. The Republic is not of this generation to keep, but it is particularly for  the young generation and future generations to preserve and to enjoy. 5. “You do not know how to sacrifice the present for a useful, fruitful  future.” How does this speech may affect the  disposition, aspirations, state policies, and lives of the citizens in general?The speech of President Jose P. Laurel, is it still relevant to our country now? Why?  ​</a>

                                            Read the following paragraphs and underline main idea.
1. The circle is the symbol of our existence and our life. It doesn’t have
beginning or ending and undoubtedly goes forever. Round and round
it goes, like a wheel that spins us for mysteries of human life.
2. Poverty has many hands, many forms. One of the hands has a foil and
to other, for many young people its bliss and escape, another hand
gambles. The most receptive reaches into the purses and bags in
search of cell phones and money. You may cut off all these hands
literally but still the problem is there. Government must do something
to eradicate poverty by all means to fully achieve development.
3. Enormous energy, enthusiasm, and organization drove the reform
efforts in America in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries,
much of it a result of social crises and political movements in the
United States. But the “age of reform,” as some scholars have called it,
was not an American phenomenon alone. It was part of a wave of
social experimentation that was occurring through much of the
industrial world. “Progressivism” in other countries influenced the
social movements in the United States. And American reform, in turn,
had significant influence on other countries as well.
4. The real Filipino is being early or on the dot. We arrive at our offices
early; if there are people who come late, they are merely exceptions to
the rule and probably have their reasons behind it. Let’s stop insulting
ourselves by thinking that “Filipino time” is hopeless; being late does
not coil from race, color or origin. Surely there will be individual who
becomes late – Filipino or not.
5. Man is distinct from all other life forms in his intellectual faculties and
speech. He is born with highly planned and structured social system.
His brain and sensory organs are perfectly designed for
communication and cohabitation with others. This is a social
dimension of man that never stops to challenge every aspect of his
being.</a>

For many months, he had admired a beautiful sports car in a dealer's showroom,and knowing his father could well afford it, he told him that it was all he wanted.As graduation day was approaching, the young man awaited signs that his father had purchased the car. Finally, on the morningof his graduation, his father called him into his private study room. His father told him how much he loved him. He handed his sona beautiful wrapped gift box Curious but somehow disappointed, the young man opened the box and found a lovely leather-boundBible. Angrily, he raised his voice at his father and said,"With all your money, you give me a Bible?" and stormed out of the house, leaving the holy book.Many years passed and the young man was very successful in his business. He had a beautiful home and a wonderful family.He realized his father was very old and thought perhaps he should go to him. He had not seen him since that graduation day. Beforehe could make arrangements, he received a telegram telling him his father had passed away and willed all of his possessions to hisson. He needed to come home immediately and took care of things.When he arrived at his father's house, sudden sadness and regret filled his heart. He began to search his father's importantpapers and saw the still new Bible, just as he had left it few years ago. With tears, he opened the Bible and began to turn pages. Ashe read those words, a car key dropped from an envelope taped behind the Bible. It had a tag with the dealer's name, the same dealerwho had the sports car he had desired. On the tag was the date of his graduation, and the words... PAID IN FULL.How many times do we miss God's blessings because they are not packed as what we expected?~~~The EndI.

Each of these different codes of ridicule. do not, it is looked upon with amusement or seems reasonable to those who practice it, but to those whoIn much of India and the Muslim world women still veilthe face as well as the body; in Europe they cover the bòdybut expose the face; in many parts of Africa and the SouthSeas they leave the breąstß bare, and in some regions they goentirely neked. In each case, no shame is felt by the peoplethemselves, though we think veiling the face is stùpid and bar-ing the bòdy improper. When Chinese and Eskimo women nowear trousers, we think it quaint, yet in Europe women maywear them for sports or work because they are more practical.Differences in more fundamental sëxx relations aròùße ourdeep emotions. In Western civilization monogamy is the idealform of marriage, enforced by the lay and the Church. Else-where, polygamy, often common, is thought disgusting andimmoral, though some countries allow it by their religion, andothers justify it for economic reasons or for the preservationof the health of the growing child. In Europe again, the moralcode upholds chastity for both sêxès before marriage, thoughin practice it is relaxed for men and is now less strict thanformerly for women. In many native communities premaritalsêxx relations are expected of young people. They hold that inthese matters experience teaches, while we feel that in refer-ence to this, a little learning is a dangerus thing.The religions of the world, in spite of their many commonelements, show equally deep-seated differences of belief andpractice. Philosophers and theologians may agree upon thefundamentals of faith, but the ordinary man clings to his ta-boos in the conviction that they are sensible and right. Thestrict Moslim may eat no pork, the strict Hindu, no beef; butthe strict Christiann may eat both-except perhaps on Fridays.The Brahmanic bull of Hindu India swings through the ba-zaars and eats his fill; the European sees in him a wastefulconcession to religious prejudice and thinks how much betterhe would be occupied in pulling a plough or converted intosteaks. The protest of the Hindu Orthodox groups of North-ern India against public ox-roasting, proposed in 1937 tocelebrate the coronation of their Majesties in Great Britain,must have seemed comic to many Englishmen. A tradition ofbeef-eating, plus a religion deeply imbued with the symbol-ism of sacrifice and of communion through partaking of fleshand bluud, finds it difficult to appreciate the sincerity of a faithwhich believes in bluudless offerings and in the venerationof a sacred animal. A cynical Hindu might say, on the otherhand, that the only calf we venerate is a golden one.litnu fon lud bom nem amo​</a>

Although I disagree with much that those who oppose animal testing say, I fully endorsetheir final conclusion that there are many better alternatives to animal testing. The Foodand Drug Administration has stated that they support the development and use ofalternatives to animal testing. Moreover many scientists have developed methods to testcosmetics and other personal products that are faster, cheaper and more accurate thantraditional animal testing. In other words there are better alternatives to animal testing andthe FDA agrees. Some readers may challenge the view that animal testing can be doneaway with. After all many believed that it is impossible to eliminate the need for animals inresearch. Nonetheless, my discussion of alternatives to animal testing is in fact addressingthe larger issue of choice. If we don't need to use animals, why should we?BRIC1.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. It is clearly an argumentative paragraph because even though the writer is on the animal's side and disagreeing about animal testing, he/she is also stating the pros and cons of animal testing which is the right thing to do because in writing an argumentative essay or paragraph, the writer must always voice out the pros and cons of both sides. The writer is also using the larger population who are against animal testing as an evidence to prove his/her point about the issue and that'll make him/her more convincing because a lot of people symphatized with animals because just like humans, animals have feelings too, can feel other emotions such as pain and they also have a family to go home to. Animals are not invincible and it's just so old-fashioned and inhumane to put them up as testers to products such as make ups.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>YEEE SAGOT NG UYAB KO YAN </p><br />

                        <p><strong>We must build up our healthy lifestyle and avoid some other things that could lead to future damage and death</strong></p><p></p><p>Explanation:</p><p>At a <strong>young age is actually a phase or period where an individual build his lifestyle to the future</strong>. Behavior and habits in youth can certainly be a benchmark for daily activities that have implications for the next 10-20 years such as<strong> sleep patterns, eating patterns, cigarette and alcohol consumption as well as the frequency of physical activity so that there needs to be habituation of healthy lifestyles starting from a young age. </strong>Moreover, at a young age a person often has more free time to be able to build positive life patterns and habits for health as the foundation of a healthy life. So that over time when an individual increases his activities, family and society, a healthy lifestyle that has been built can still become a habit or lifestyle because it is based on a strong foundation.</p><p>This isimportant to be applied by the entire <strong>younger generation considering that currently the threat of various deadly diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, heart attack, cancer, stroke and others often begins to attack at a relatively young age.</strong> If in the past these diseases were only identical with the elderly, now 20-30 years of age already have a potential enough risk to be attacked by diseases that have implications for future damages and even death in some cause.</p><p>Economic progress and technological convenience are some of the factors that decrease the quality of healthy lifestyles in society where food products are increasingly varied but come with poor nutritional value and various substances that are harmful to the body such as sugar, oil and various preservatives. The younger generation also tends to be lazy with easy access to transportation and changes in industrial patterns that increasingly rely on machine and computer technology. Therefore, there <strong>must be a high awareness, especially in the younger generation, where modernization in the global world should not make the potential for future damage and death </strong>in the younger generation also more potential.</p><p><strong>Learn More About :</strong></p><p>How lifestyle related to health? https://brainly.ph/question/8690550</p><p>#SPJ2</p><br />

Compare the views of the author.From an essay...Respect is the first positive step in building a relationship and relationships are central to conflict transformation. One does not have to like a person or understand his viewpoint to accord him respect. Respect comes with the belief that a person or culture can have beliefs contradictory to ours and we should still honor them, as basic respect is a fundamental right of all human beings. In addition, goals and concessions become easier to attain when the element of respect is present As Bill Richardson, the US permanent representative to the UN put it. "You have to be a human being. You cannot be arrogant... If you treat each individual with respect, each nation with dignity, you can get a lot further than trying to muscle them". ""Excerpt quoted from. Respect by Sana Farid https://www.beyondintractability.org/essay/respectFrom a research paper...eeWe believe that respectful children and adolescents tend to become respectful, civil, and tolerant adults. Conversely, we assume that the origins of incivility, disrespect, intolerance, and other problems of adults are formed in childhood and adolescence. For example, lacking respect for parents or authorities, a young child may not be receptive to what one can learn at home or at school. Brought up to disrespect other people based on social status or race, a child may become prejudiced. With a lack of respect for oneself, an adolescent may develop a negative self-concept and a lack of respect for others. Growing up with disrespect for older people, a young adult may be unable to keep a job in the work world that requires understanding the authority of others. Respect and disrespect indeed have relevance across the entire life span, for instance, in respect for the elderly and respect for the dignity of the dying.""Excerpt quoted from: Research and Theory on Respect and Disrespect: Catching Up with the Public and Practitioners by David W.

                        <p>Shout-out to our beloved mayor! As a student leader of <strong>(insert name of your school)</strong>, I have observed the following disaster hazards <strong>that frequently affect our cherished community - improper waste disposal, unexpected community fire, and flash/urban floods. These disasters pose risk to those with limited knowledge in how to prepare themselves in case they encounter these disasters anytime.</strong></p><p></p><p>May I respectfully suggest the following measures to prevent future deaths:</p><strong>Every constituent must be aware of the disaster risks in our area. In order to do so, every barangay must properly furnish a DRM (Disaster Risk Management) and conduct training and meetings with their citizens to keep them updated on these hazardous risks, what escape plans and emergency responses are available, and what alternatives can be done if these disasters unexpectedly happen.</strong><strong>Every household should be inspected or evaluated especially those in high-risk areas.</strong><strong>Each barangay must impose strict policies and practices in their area. If it is appropriate and needed, a penalty may be issued (as long as no rights are being violated.)</strong><p><strong>These measures should be done for the said disaster risks. For each risk, I suggest the following measures:</strong></p><strong>A Clean and Green Project with the combined forces of the government and the citizens must be done from time to time (e.g. every two or three months) to at least reduce the water level of flash floods in the area. This project aims to remove garbages in creeks and rivers as well as to push the citizens to clean their surroundings.</strong><strong>A proper compost pit should be implemented with the segregation of different wastes. Every household should learn to separate wastes at home and not wait for the garbage collectors to do that to them. Initiative in this matter is a must.</strong><strong>Fires can happen due to various causes. To at least reduce these unexpected fires, the fire department may conduct surprise inspections especially to those houses with no firewalls.</strong><strong>The teenagers in the community may be invited to workshops that may boost or encourage them to think of researches, strategies, and solutions to alleviate these disaster risks in the community.</strong><p></p><p>We may still be young but <strong>we can make these things happen and be successful in reducing these disaster risks in our beloved community. Everyone's cooperation is needed to do this, so everyone should be properly informed on the procedures it takes to prevent deaths and losses. I, as a student leader, together with my team, am willing to step up and help in any projects that may help our community to be safe for every resident. Some of these suggestions may or may not work out due to other factors, but I believe that we can accomplish our goal and employ good development to the benefit of the residents and future generations.</strong></p><p></p><p>Happy studying!</p><p>Feel free to add and re-construct the passages (and also correct my grammar if there is an error.) </p><br />

                            23. paki sagutan Ang nasa picture Ladies and gentlemen,Teenage pregnancy is a serious issue that affects not only the young mother and father, but also their families and society as a whole. It is important that we address this issue and work to prevent teenage pregnancies.First of all, teenage pregnancy can have negative effects on the health of the mother and the baby. Pregnancy at a young age can increase the risk of complications such as preterm labor, low birth weight, and lack of prenatal care. It is also important to consider the emotional and psychological effects of teenage pregnancy. Many young mothers face social stigma, financial stress, and difficulty in completing their education.Secondly, teenage pregnancy can also have economic consequences. Raising a child is a significant financial burden, and it can be especially difficult for young parents who are still in school or have limited job prospects. The cost of raising a child can have a long-term impact on the parents' financial stability and their ability to provide for their family.Finally, teenage pregnancy can also have societal consequences. It can lead to a cycle of poverty and underachievement, as young parents may struggle to complete their education and secure good jobs. This can have a ripple effect, as their children may also face challenges in their own education and future prospects.In conclusion, teenage pregnancy is a complex issue that requires a multifaceted approach to prevention and support. We must work together to provide young people with the education, resources, and support they need to make informed and responsible decisions about their sexual health. Thank you.​</h2><br />

                            24. Directions: Choose one article and make a precis and give a suitable title. Use the given organizer at the end of the articles in organizing your answers. Text #1 It is physically impossible for a well-educated, intellectual, or brave man to make money the chief object of his thoughts just as it is for him to make his dinner the principal object of them. All healthy people like their dinners, but their dinner is not the main object of their lives. So all healthy minded people like making money ought to like it and enjoy the sensation of winning it; it is something better than money. A good soldier, for instance, mainly wishes to do his fighting well. He is glad of his pay-very properly so and justly grumbles when you keep him ten years without it-till, his main mission of life is to win battles, not to be paid for winning them. So of clergymen. The clergyman's object is essentially baptize and preach not to be paid for preaching. So of doctors. They like fees no doubt-ought to like them; yet if they are brave and well-educated the entire object to their lives is not fees. They on the whole, desire to cure the sick; and if they are good doctors and 26 Summary a Precis and the choice were fairly to them, would rather cure their patient and lose their fee than kill him and get it. And so with all the other brave and rightly trained men: their work is first, their fee second-very important always; but still second.  Text #2 Home is the young, who known "nothing of the world and who would be forlorn and sad, if thrown upon it. It is providential, shelter of the weak and inexperienced, who have to learn as yet to cope with the temptations which lies outside of it. It is the place of training of those who are not only ignorant, but have no yet learnt how to learn, and who have to be taught by careful individual trail, how to set about profiting by the lessons of teacher. And it is the school of elementary studies-not of advances, for such studies alone can make master minds. Moreover, it is the shrine of our best affections, the bosom of our fondest recollections, at spell upon our after life, a stay for world weary mind and soul; wherever we are, till the end comes. Such are attributes or offices of home, and like to these, in one or other sense or measure, are the attributes and offices of a college in a university.  Text #3 Teaching is the noblest of professions. A teacher has a sacred duty to perform. It is he on whom rests the responsibility of moulding the character of young children. Apart from developing their intellect, he can inculcate in them qualities of good citizenship, remaining neat and clean, talking decently and sitting properly. These virtues are not easy to be imbibed. Only he who himself leads a life of simplicity, purity and rigid discipline can successfully cultivate these habits in his pupils. Besides a teacher always remain young. He may grow old in age, but not in spite. Perpetual contact with budding youths keeps him happy and cheerful. There are moments when domestic worries weigh heavily on his mind, but the delightful company of innocent children makes him overcome his transient moods of despair. ​</h2><br />

                            27. Read the following paragraphs and underline main idea.
1. The circle is the symbol of our existence and our life. It doesn’t have
beginning or ending and undoubtedly goes forever. Round and round
it goes, like a wheel that spins us for mysteries of human life.
2. Poverty has many hands, many forms. One of the hands has a foil and
to other, for many young people its bliss and escape, another hand
gambles. The most receptive reaches into the purses and bags in
search of cell phones and money. You may cut off all these hands
literally but still the problem is there. Government must do something
to eradicate poverty by all means to fully achieve development.
3. Enormous energy, enthusiasm, and organization drove the reform
efforts in America in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries,
much of it a result of social crises and political movements in the
United States. But the “age of reform,” as some scholars have called it,
was not an American phenomenon alone. It was part of a wave of
social experimentation that was occurring through much of the
industrial world. “Progressivism” in other countries influenced the
social movements in the United States. And American reform, in turn,
had significant influence on other countries as well.
4. The real Filipino is being early or on the dot. We arrive at our offices
early; if there are people who come late, they are merely exceptions to
the rule and probably have their reasons behind it. Let’s stop insulting
ourselves by thinking that “Filipino time” is hopeless; being late does
not coil from race, color or origin. Surely there will be individual who
becomes late – Filipino or not.
5. Man is distinct from all other life forms in his intellectual faculties and
speech. He is born with highly planned and structured social system.
His brain and sensory organs are perfectly designed for
communication and cohabitation with others. This is a social
dimension of man that never stops to challenge every aspect of his
being.</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>A young man was getting ready to graduate from college. For many months he had admired a beautiful sports car in a dealer’s showroom, and knowing that his father could well afford it, he told him that was all he wanted.
</p><p>
</p><p>As Graduation Day approached the young man awaited signs that his father had purchased the car for him. Finally on the day he was to graduate his father called him into his private study, told him how proud he was to have such a fine son and how much he loved him. He then handed him a beautifully wrapped gift box.
</p><p>
</p><p>Curious, but somewhat disappointed the young man opened the box and found a lovely leather bound Bible with his name embossed on it in gold. He was angry so he raised his voice to his father and said, "With all of your money you give me a Bible rather than the sports car I wanted.” He then stormed out of the house leaving the Bible behind.
</p><p>
</p><p>Many years passed and the young man was very successful in the business he went in. He had a beautiful home and a wonderful family but realized when he thought about his father that he was very old. He then decided that perhaps he should go to see him because he had not seen him since that graduation day.
</p><p>
</p><p>However, before he could make arrangements to go he received a phone call from a funeral home director telling him that his father had passed away and had willed all of his possessions to him. He was told that he needed to come home immediately and take care of things.
</p><p>
</p><p>When the son arrived at his father’s house sadness and regret filled his heart. He began to search through his father’s important documents and saw the Bible his father had given him for graduation. The Bible looked new just as it was years ago when he was given it.
</p><p>
</p><p>With tears in his eyes he opened the Bible and began to turn through the pages. His father had carefully underlined a verse which was Matthew 7:11 which reads, "And if ye being evil know how to give good gifts to your children how much more shall your Heavenly Father which is in Heaven give to those who ask Him.”
</p><p>
</p><p>As the son read those words a car key dropped from the back of the Bible. It had a tag on it with the car dealer’s name, the same dealer who had the sports car that he wanted so badly for his college graduation. On the tag was the date of his graduation and the words written in large print "PAID IN FULL.”
</p><p>
</p><p>Many times during our lifetime we miss God’s blessings because they are not packaged as we expected them to be.
</p><p>
</p><p>If this true story has touched your heart and you have a son or daughter graduating from high school or college this year give them what they want if you can afford it but also give them a Bible as well with their name engraved on the front of it.
</p><p>
</p><p>Graduates, may I tell you what opportunity is and when it knocks. Opportunity will never knock. You can wait your entire life listening and hoping that the right opportunity for you will knock, but rest assured that it will not knock.
</p><p>
</p><p>You are a high school or college graduate now and you are opportunity and you must knock on the door that you wish will lead you to where you wish to go in life.
</p><p>
</p><p>By graduating you have prepared yourself to recognize the opportunity you wish to pursue so siege that opportunity as you develop the strength of your personality and build a self-image with which you are able to live with.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

In Western civilization monogamy is the idealform of marriage, enforced by the lay and the Church. Else-where, polygamy, often common, is thought disgusting andimmoral, though some countries allow it by their religion, andothers justify it for economic reasons or for the preservationof the health of the growing child. In Europe again, the moralcode upholds chastity for both sêxès before marriage, thoughin practice it is relaxed for men and is now less strict thanformerly for women. In many native communities premaritalsêxx relations are expected of young people. They hold that inthese matters experience teaches, while we feel that in refer-ence to this, a little learning is a dangerus thing.The religions of the world, in spite of their many commonelements, show equally deep-seated differences of belief andpractice. Philosophers and theologians may agree upon thefundamentals of faith, but the ordinary man clings to his ta-boos in the conviction that they are sensible and right. Thestrict Moslim may eat no pork, the strict Hindu, no beef; butthe strict Christiann may eat both-except perhaps on Fridays.The Brahmanic bull of Hindu India swings through the ba-zaars and eats his fill; the European sees in him a wastefulconcession to religious prejudice and thinks how much betterhe would be occupied in pulling a plough or converted intosteaks. The protest of the Hindu Orthodox groups of North-ern India against public ox-roasting, proposed in 1937 tocelebrate the coronation of their Majesties in Great Britain,must have seemed comic to many Englishmen. A tradition ofbeef-eating, plus a religion deeply imbued with the symbol-ism of sacrifice and of communion through partaking of fleshand bluud, finds it difficult to appreciate the sincerity of a faithwhich believes in bluudless offerings and in the venerationof a sacred animal. A cynical Hindu might say, on the otherhand, that the only calf we venerate is a golden one.litnu fon lud bom nem amo​</h2><br />
