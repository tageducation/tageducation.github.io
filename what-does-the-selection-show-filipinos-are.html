                                            What is It This module talks about the representative music selections of Mindanao. Surely, you will get amazed how the ensemble of Mindanao becomes popular and how it contributes to the preservation of Mindanao's culture and tradition. Origin When we hear the distinct ringing sound of the Kulintang, we immediately think of Mindanao, Muslims to be exact. But where does the kulintang come from? Is it an original Filipino instrument? Is it related to Islam? Historians say that this instrument is connected to the other types of "gongs in a row" in other parts of southeast Asia. Long before the arrival of the Spaniards in the Philippines, traders from neighboring countries in the south like Borneo and Indonesia were actively engaged in various commercial and cultural activities with the natives of Sulu and other islands in the southern part of the archipelago. The map below shows the general picture of Gong and Chime culture in southeast Asia. We can see that there are three major ensemble types that emerged in the region long time ago. The Piphat ensemble of Thailand, the Gamelan ensemble of Indonesia, and the Kulintang ensemble of Borneo. It is obvious that the term Kulintang is also used by our neighboring countries.

                            25. What is It This module talks about the representative music selections of Mindanao. Surely, you will get amazed how the ensemble of Mindanao becomes popular and how it contributes to the preservation of Mindanao's culture and tradition. Origin When we hear the distinct ringing sound of the Kulintang, we immediately think of Mindanao, Muslims to be exact. But where does the kulintang come from? Is it an original Filipino instrument? Is it related to Islam? Historians say that this instrument is connected to the other types of "gongs in a row" in other parts of southeast Asia. Long before the arrival of the Spaniards in the Philippines, traders from neighboring countries in the south like Borneo and Indonesia were actively engaged in various commercial and cultural activities with the natives of Sulu and other islands in the southern part of the archipelago. The map below shows the general picture of Gong and Chime culture in southeast Asia. We can see that there are three major ensemble types that emerged in the region long time ago. The Piphat ensemble of Thailand, the Gamelan ensemble of Indonesia, and the Kulintang ensemble of Borneo. It is obvious that the term Kulintang is also used by our neighboring countries.
