                                            The Last Letter from Your Lover
Questions and Topics for Discussion
1. What similarities are there between Ellie and Jennifer? How do their experiences reflect their
respective eras? Of the two women, with whom do you empathize or identify the most?
2. Have you ever written or received a love letter? Have you ever sent a romantic e-mail or text?
Do you think electronic communication has changed the nature of expression? How does the
emotional weight of a love letter compare with that of spoken words?
3. Does Laurence love Jennifer? Imagine yourself in his position. What were his motives in lying to
Jennifer about 'Hare's death?
4. How did your opinion of O'Hare develop over the course of the novel? Is he a traditional
romantic hero?
5. If Jennifer and O'Hare had run away together, what would their lives have been like?
6. Jennifer's friends and her mother are reluctant to tell her much about her life before the accident,
urging her to focus on the future. Why? Do you believe they knew about her affair?
7. Why does Yvonne react the way she does to Jennifer's decision to leave Laurence?
8. Think of Jennifer's many roles as mother, daughter, wife, lover, and friend. Is it possible to fill all
those roles at once? Should any one role be a priority and, if so, which one? With this in mind, did
Jennifer make the right choice in pursuing O'Hare?
9. Examine the female friendships in the novel, particularly the interactions between Ellie and her
girlfriends. Had you been friends with Ellie, what advice would you have given her about John?
What would you say to John?
10. Rory argues that being in love doesn't excuse someone from being responsible for their actions,
that "everyone makes a choice" to do either the right or the wrong thing (page 332). Ellie disagrees,
believing that people can be swept away by emotion. What do you think?
11. Did you find the ending satisfactory? What happens next for Jennifer and Ellie?</a>

FACE: Okay, tell me. . . who among did it?
WHEELS AND WEIGHTS [Aloud]: Surely not we!
HANDS: Don’t look at us. It’s not we either.
PENDULUM [Sheepishly]: I did it! The truth is. . . I’m tired of tick-tocking and swaying for
fifty years. I give up!
FACE [Angrily]: You lazy thing! How could you!
PENDULUM: It is easy for you, Lady Face, to set yourself above me and accuse me of laziness.
You do nothing but look pretty and stare at people and watch all that go in and on in the kitchen.
How would you like to be in the dark closet and do nothing but wag back and forth year after
year like I do? I’m tired of my life. After thinking it over last night, I figured out how many
times in a month do I have to tick while the Hour Hand just goes around once. Do you have
any idea how many times that is?
MINUTE HAND [Brightly speaking up]: Forty-three thousand two hundred times!
PENDULUM: Right! And in one week, how many times must I wag?
MINUTE HAND [Thinking]: Ten thousand eighty.
PENDULUM: Exactly! And in one year?
3
MINUTE HAND [Thinking harder]:. .Er-r-r. Let me think.
HOUR HAND: Take your time, dear; you can do it.
MINUTE HAND [Shouting]: Thirty-one million four hundred and forty-nine thousand six
hundred! Half ticks and half ticks. There is silence. Everyone waits for the Pendulum to say
whether the answer is correct or not. And then. .
PENDULUM: Very good, smart fellow! Now, you all see why I’m tired of ticktocking. It’s too
much to ask of anyone. So please count me out.
FACE: Mr. Pendulum, would you mind wagging six times, only six times to please a lady?
PENDULUM: With pleasure! Here. . . tick-tock, tick-tock.
FACE: Thank you, I hope it did not tire you.
PENDULUM: Of course not. Sixty times would not tire me, nor six hundred, nor six thousand,
but when it comes to thirty-one million. . . ugh! That’s too much to ask of anyone.
FACE: It tires you to think about all those wags, but it does not tire you to wag one wag at a
time. Isn’t that true?
PENDULUM: Yes, but thirty-one million!
FACE: You say it in a minute, but you have to do it a whole long year---winter, summer, spring,
and fall. Think about it. Nobody hurries you.
HOUR HAND: Look at it this way. Spring cannot come until you have comfortably tick-tocked
so many million more times.
MINUTE HAND: And the leaves cannot turn red in autumn, and Jack Frost cannot appear
before you give the signal.
FACE: You see. Time is in your hands and so much depends on you. Would you rather let
people down?
PENDULUM [Overjoyed]: That’s so! I’m an important person! [Jumping] Ye-hey! You’re
right! I don’t have to rush. There’s always a year’s tick-tocking. So, all get back to work.
ALL: Yeah, back to work!
With this, the Wheels begin to turn; the Hands begin to move. Lady Face smiles brightly and
the Pendulum proudly sways back and forth---tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock---as if nothing
Happened.

                                            El Verdadero Decalogo
Apolinario Mabini
First. Love God and your honor above all things: God as the fountain of all truth, of all justice and of all activity; and your honor, the only power that will oblige you to be faithful, just and industrious.
Second. Worship God in the form that your conscience may deem most righteous and worthy: for God speaks in the conscience that condemns your evil deeds and praises your good ones.
Third. Cultivate the special gifts that God granted you, working and studying according to your ability, never leaving the path of righteousness and justice, in order to attain your own perfection by which means you shall contribute to the progress of humanity; fulfill the mission to which God has appointed you in this life, and by so doing shall be honored, and being honored, you glorify God.
Fourth. Love your country after God and your honor more than yourself: for she is the only Paradise which God has given you in this life, the only patrimony of your race, the only inheritance of your ancestors, and the only hope of your posterity; because of her you have life, love and interests, happiness, honor and God.
Fifth. Strive for the happiness of your country before your own, making of her the kingdom of reason, of justice and of labor: if she is happy, your family shall likewise be happy.
Sixth. Strive for the independence of your country: for only you can have any real interest in her advancement and exaltation, because her independence constitutes your own liberty; her advancement, your perfection; and her exaltation, your own glory and immortality.
Seventh. Do not recognize in your country the authority of any person who has not been elected by you and your countrymen; for authority emanates from God, and as God speaks in the conscience of every man, the person designated and proclaimed by the conscience of a whole people is the only one who can use true authority.
Eighth. Strive for a Republic and never for a monarchy in your country: for the latter exalts one or several families and founds a dynasty; the former makes a people noble and worthy through reason, great through liberty, and prosperous and brilliant through labor.
Ninth. Love thy neighbor as yourself: for God has imposed upon him, as well as upon you, the obligation to help and not to do unto you what he would not have done unto him; but if your neighbor, failing in this sacred duty, attempts against your life, liberty and interests, then destroy and annihilate him for the Supreme Law of self-preservationprevails.
Tenth. Consider countrymen more than your neighbor; see him as friend, brother, or at least comrade, with whom you are bound by one fate, by the same joys and sorrows and by common aspirations and interests.
“Therefore, as long as national frontiers subsist, raised and maintained by the selfishness of race and of family, with your countryman alone shalt you unite in perfect solidarity of purpose and interest, in order to have force, not only to resist the common enemy but also to attain all the aims of human life.”

                                            Dear Younger "Self” You learned from the previous lessons that "Self" is a "Reflective Project". We do reflective assessment, and we keep on trying to change ourselves for what we think is the best. Big part of the reflecting process is considerations like how you think people perceive you. However, sometimes you could get so caught up with a lot of things that you tend to fail to formally project yourself to others. This performance task will open the chance for you to tell everything that you want to say to your younger self. Create a letter for your younger self telling him/her about what you wish you knew when you were younger. Share all the lessons you learned, your discovered characteristics, habits, and experiences that you want your younger self to know. Dear_______,​</a>

                            14. The Discontented Pendulum
FACE: Okay, tell me. . . who among did it?
WHEELS AND WEIGHTS [Aloud]: Surely not we!
HANDS: Don’t look at us. It’s not we either.
PENDULUM [Sheepishly]: I did it! The truth is. . . I’m tired of tick-tocking and swaying for
fifty years. I give up!
FACE [Angrily]: You lazy thing! How could you!
PENDULUM: It is easy for you, Lady Face, to set yourself above me and accuse me of laziness.
You do nothing but look pretty and stare at people and watch all that go in and on in the kitchen.
How would you like to be in the dark closet and do nothing but wag back and forth year after
year like I do? I’m tired of my life. After thinking it over last night, I figured out how many
times in a month do I have to tick while the Hour Hand just goes around once. Do you have
any idea how many times that is?
MINUTE HAND [Brightly speaking up]: Forty-three thousand two hundred times!
PENDULUM: Right! And in one week, how many times must I wag?
MINUTE HAND [Thinking]: Ten thousand eighty.
PENDULUM: Exactly! And in one year?
3
MINUTE HAND [Thinking harder]:. .Er-r-r. Let me think.
HOUR HAND: Take your time, dear; you can do it.
MINUTE HAND [Shouting]: Thirty-one million four hundred and forty-nine thousand six
hundred! Half ticks and half ticks. There is silence. Everyone waits for the Pendulum to say
whether the answer is correct or not. And then. .
PENDULUM: Very good, smart fellow! Now, you all see why I’m tired of ticktocking. It’s too
much to ask of anyone. So please count me out.
FACE: Mr. Pendulum, would you mind wagging six times, only six times to please a lady?
PENDULUM: With pleasure! Here. . . tick-tock, tick-tock.
FACE: Thank you, I hope it did not tire you.
PENDULUM: Of course not. Sixty times would not tire me, nor six hundred, nor six thousand,
but when it comes to thirty-one million. . . ugh! That’s too much to ask of anyone.
FACE: It tires you to think about all those wags, but it does not tire you to wag one wag at a
time. Isn’t that true?
PENDULUM: Yes, but thirty-one million!
FACE: You say it in a minute, but you have to do it a whole long year---winter, summer, spring,
and fall. Think about it. Nobody hurries you.
HOUR HAND: Look at it this way. Spring cannot come until you have comfortably tick-tocked
so many million more times.
MINUTE HAND: And the leaves cannot turn red in autumn, and Jack Frost cannot appear
before you give the signal.
FACE: You see. Time is in your hands and so much depends on you. Would you rather let
people down?
PENDULUM [Overjoyed]: That’s so! I’m an important person! [Jumping] Ye-hey! You’re
right! I don’t have to rush. There’s always a year’s tick-tocking. So, all get back to work.
ALL: Yeah, back to work!
With this, the Wheels begin to turn; the Hands begin to move. Lady Face smiles brightly and
the Pendulum proudly sways back and forth---tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock---as if nothing
Happened.

It may sound absolutely discouraging but have a think about it: if there is nothing to hold you back, everything is possible. With this in mind, make a bold, confident, and reckless step in the life, hurry to fall, 9)_________ the sooner you will do this, the more time you will have for getting back to the top. 10)________ do not let the obstacles and failures stop you as they are just other twists of a great life adventure you are to embark on and we are looking forward to witness.

                            17. El Verdadero Decalogo
Apolinario Mabini
First. Love God and your honor above all things: God as the fountain of all truth, of all justice and of all activity; and your honor, the only power that will oblige you to be faithful, just and industrious.
Second. Worship God in the form that your conscience may deem most righteous and worthy: for God speaks in the conscience that condemns your evil deeds and praises your good ones.
Third. Cultivate the special gifts that God granted you, working and studying according to your ability, never leaving the path of righteousness and justice, in order to attain your own perfection by which means you shall contribute to the progress of humanity; fulfill the mission to which God has appointed you in this life, and by so doing shall be honored, and being honored, you glorify God.
Fourth. Love your country after God and your honor more than yourself: for she is the only Paradise which God has given you in this life, the only patrimony of your race, the only inheritance of your ancestors, and the only hope of your posterity; because of her you have life, love and interests, happiness, honor and God.
Fifth. Strive for the happiness of your country before your own, making of her the kingdom of reason, of justice and of labor: if she is happy, your family shall likewise be happy.
Sixth. Strive for the independence of your country: for only you can have any real interest in her advancement and exaltation, because her independence constitutes your own liberty; her advancement, your perfection; and her exaltation, your own glory and immortality.
Seventh. Do not recognize in your country the authority of any person who has not been elected by you and your countrymen; for authority emanates from God, and as God speaks in the conscience of every man, the person designated and proclaimed by the conscience of a whole people is the only one who can use true authority.
Eighth. Strive for a Republic and never for a monarchy in your country: for the latter exalts one or several families and founds a dynasty; the former makes a people noble and worthy through reason, great through liberty, and prosperous and brilliant through labor.
Ninth. Love thy neighbor as yourself: for God has imposed upon him, as well as upon you, the obligation to help and not to do unto you what he would not have done unto him; but if your neighbor, failing in this sacred duty, attempts against your life, liberty and interests, then destroy and annihilate him for the Supreme Law of self-preservationprevails.
Tenth. Consider countrymen more than your neighbor; see him as friend, brother, or at least comrade, with whom you are bound by one fate, by the same joys and sorrows and by common aspirations and interests.
“Therefore, as long as national frontiers subsist, raised and maintained by the selfishness of race and of family, with your countryman alone shalt you unite in perfect solidarity of purpose and interest, in order to have force, not only to resist the common enemy but also to attain all the aims of human life.”
