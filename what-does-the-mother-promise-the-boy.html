                                            What I Can Do Read the story and do what is asked. The Legend of the Lizard Long ago, there was a mother who loved her only son deeply. She was a pious woman and her son imitated most of her good deeds, which were many. Her son was good at heart, but young. The woman knew that he still had much to learn before he could fully adopt saintly ways. God decided to test this young son's piety and love for his mother. He sent a beautiful woman to capture the young man's eager heart. The beautiful woman urged the son to keep their meetings a secret from his mother, and though it pained the boy to do so, for he never kept secrets from his mother, he obeyed. But the real challenge had not yet been failed. The beautiful woman beguiled the boy so that she was able to make him promise that he would do anything she asked. She therefore asked that he should - if he loved her as truly as he declared - cut out his mother's heart and bring it to her. The young man, blinded by love, dutifully slaughtered his beloved mother. It was exactly six o'clock in the evening, and his mother was reciting the Angelus then. He held the still beating heart in his hands as he rushed to where he knew the girl stood waiting. But when he got to their meeting-place, the girl was not there. Nothing was there - save for the realization of what he had done. The heart still beat, though it tarried long in the hands of the prodigal son. And then it began to speak. In his shock, the boy dropped the heart, and it fell into a crack in the ground. "Are you in pain, my child?" the mother's heart inquired. "Let me sing you a lullaby, to soothe you to sleep." The heart softly started singing, as lovingly as its owner would have done. And in the son's remorse he fell flat on his belly and kissed the ground that the heart lay on. The boy was so filled with guilt and grief that he did not notice himself changing, growing smaller, losing all his hair and clothing so that he was a tiny web-footed thing, that kissed and kissed at the ground as if begging for someone's forgiveness. At exactly six o'clock every night, when the Angelus strikes, the lizard comes down from the walls of the house, and crawls down to the floor, where it would make slight ticking sounds like quick kisses. It has been said that the lizard has not yet redeemed itself in its own eyes, and that with its tiny ears it could hear an ancient beating, and a lullaby that does not end Directions: After reading a story, write about how the story is similar or different from your own life by using the questions in the chart.

                                            What I Can Do Read the story and do what is asked. The Legend of the Lizard Long ago, there was a mother who loved her only son deeply. She was a pious woman and her son imitated most of her good deeds, which were many. Her son was good at heart, but young. The woman knew that he still had much to learn before he could fully adopt saintly ways. God decided to test this young son's piety and love for his mother. He sent a beautiful woman to capture the young man's eager heart. The beautiful woman urged the son to keep their meetings a secret from his mother, and though it pained the boy to do so, for he never kept secrets from his mother, he obeyed. But the real challenge had not yet been failed. The beautiful woman beguiled the boy so that she was able to make him promise that he would do anything she asked. She therefore asked that he should - if he loved her as truly as he declared - cut out his mother's heart and bring it to her. The young man, blinded by love, dutifully slaughtered his beloved mother. It was exactly six o'clock in the evening, and his mother was reciting the Angelus then. He held the still beating heart in his hands as he rushed to where he knew the girl stood waiting. But when he got to their meeting-place, the girl was not there. Nothing was there - save for the realization of what he had done. The heart still beat, though it tarried long in the hands of the prodigal son. And then it began to speak. In his shock, the boy dropped the heart, and it fell into a crack in the ground. "Are you in pain, my child?" the mother's heart inquired. "Let me sing you a lullaby, to soothe you to sleep." The heart softly started singing, as lovingly as its owner would have done. And in the son's remorse he fell flat on his belly and kissed the ground that the heart lay on. The boy was so filled with guilt and grief that he did not notice himself changing, growing smaller, losing all his hair and clothing so that he was a tiny web-footed thing, that kissed and kissed at the ground as if begging for someone's forgiveness. At exactly six o'clock every night, when the Angelus strikes, the lizard comes down from the walls of the house, and crawls down to the floor, where it would make slight ticking sounds like quick kisses. It has been said that the lizard has not yet redeemed itself in its own eyes, and that with its tiny ears it could hear an ancient beating, and a lullaby that does not end Directions: After reading a story, write about how the story is similar or different from your own life by using the questions in the chart.

                                             The next week Mother become very ill.She was rushed to the hospital. I was allowed to see her only after a day Father said she was too weak to even speak. When l come in her hospital room i saw her hugging a doll . An awfully ugly little doll binked several times and raised its slimy little  hands to Mother. My Mother. What's THAT?lwrinkled my nose in disgust. Why honey, she's your little baby sister. You are a big brother now! And she hugged up again! Yuck My lips curled and i ran out out of the room. I wiped the tears that rolled down my cheeks. I was jealous. My father found me and scolded me. He said I should go and apologize to Mother for upsetting her After some spanking. I obeyed. I went book to her room "You're a liar. - you told me you love me. I do, sweetie.. Then, why? Aren't shouted at Mother. you happy you have a sister to play with a now "No." And that was that, Mother tried hard to establish ties between the ugly doll and me. But really don't ike it. 's no fun at all, not like Mother, I can't cimb trees, it can't run fast, it wets the bed it keeps on crying every time it trips and.it's always with Mother. It's stealing Mother away from me. Mother had two more ugly dolls the next year. She said they're "eye-dental things. Maybe because their eyes and teeth look the same. In fact, they looked like so much that I can't tell one ugly doll from another. I often saw Mother take different colored stones. Father said it should stop Mother from making more ugly dolls. But I didn't think that it worked because in the next seven years, nine screaming ugly dolls, some with long hair, others with short hair, surrounded me. Some are colored like chocolates, others milky, and still some are the color of coffee. There are thin ums and fat 'ums. but all of them are annoyingly noisy. And unbearably ugly, They even drool like my dog. Tagpi. I despised them all and I promised myself that when I grow up. i would develop a medicine to stop mothers from having ugly dolls. The witch doctors and faith healers in our town couldn't stop Mother from moking ugly dols. but I will. And now have grown up. In my quest to stop mothers from making ugly babies (my father threatened to stop me from schooling if i continue calling Mother's girls as ugly dolls. so now! call them ugly babies instead). I ended up in medical school. I become on obstetrician-gynecologist. I'm on my way to the delivery room for my first time to deliver an ugly baby. I still loathe babies. Ugly dolls that they are. Five hours later, I tapped the back of the newborn and a cry is heard. I stared at the helpless thing not realizing that tears are rolling down my cheeks again. This time, I smiled.

                            8. What I Can Do Read the story and do what is asked. The Legend of the Lizard Long ago, there was a mother who loved her only son deeply. She was a pious woman and her son imitated most of her good deeds, which were many. Her son was good at heart, but young. The woman knew that he still had much to learn before he could fully adopt saintly ways. God decided to test this young son's piety and love for his mother. He sent a beautiful woman to capture the young man's eager heart. The beautiful woman urged the son to keep their meetings a secret from his mother, and though it pained the boy to do so, for he never kept secrets from his mother, he obeyed. But the real challenge had not yet been failed. The beautiful woman beguiled the boy so that she was able to make him promise that he would do anything she asked. She therefore asked that he should - if he loved her as truly as he declared - cut out his mother's heart and bring it to her. The young man, blinded by love, dutifully slaughtered his beloved mother. It was exactly six o'clock in the evening, and his mother was reciting the Angelus then. He held the still beating heart in his hands as he rushed to where he knew the girl stood waiting. But when he got to their meeting-place, the girl was not there. Nothing was there - save for the realization of what he had done. The heart still beat, though it tarried long in the hands of the prodigal son. And then it began to speak. In his shock, the boy dropped the heart, and it fell into a crack in the ground. "Are you in pain, my child?" the mother's heart inquired. "Let me sing you a lullaby, to soothe you to sleep." The heart softly started singing, as lovingly as its owner would have done. And in the son's remorse he fell flat on his belly and kissed the ground that the heart lay on. The boy was so filled with guilt and grief that he did not notice himself changing, growing smaller, losing all his hair and clothing so that he was a tiny web-footed thing, that kissed and kissed at the ground as if begging for someone's forgiveness. At exactly six o'clock every night, when the Angelus strikes, the lizard comes down from the walls of the house, and crawls down to the floor, where it would make slight ticking sounds like quick kisses. It has been said that the lizard has not yet redeemed itself in its own eyes, and that with its tiny ears it could hear an ancient beating, and a lullaby that does not end Directions: After reading a story, write about how the story is similar or different from your own life by using the questions in the chart.

                            14.  The next week Mother become very ill.She was rushed to the hospital. I was allowed to see her only after a day Father said she was too weak to even speak. When l come in her hospital room i saw her hugging a doll . An awfully ugly little doll binked several times and raised its slimy little  hands to Mother. My Mother. What's THAT?lwrinkled my nose in disgust. Why honey, she's your little baby sister. You are a big brother now! And she hugged up again! Yuck My lips curled and i ran out out of the room. I wiped the tears that rolled down my cheeks. I was jealous. My father found me and scolded me. He said I should go and apologize to Mother for upsetting her After some spanking. I obeyed. I went book to her room "You're a liar. - you told me you love me. I do, sweetie.. Then, why? Aren't shouted at Mother. you happy you have a sister to play with a now "No." And that was that, Mother tried hard to establish ties between the ugly doll and me. But really don't ike it. 's no fun at all, not like Mother, I can't cimb trees, it can't run fast, it wets the bed it keeps on crying every time it trips and.it's always with Mother. It's stealing Mother away from me. Mother had two more ugly dolls the next year. She said they're "eye-dental things. Maybe because their eyes and teeth look the same. In fact, they looked like so much that I can't tell one ugly doll from another. I often saw Mother take different colored stones. Father said it should stop Mother from making more ugly dolls. But I didn't think that it worked because in the next seven years, nine screaming ugly dolls, some with long hair, others with short hair, surrounded me. Some are colored like chocolates, others milky, and still some are the color of coffee. There are thin ums and fat 'ums. but all of them are annoyingly noisy. And unbearably ugly, They even drool like my dog. Tagpi. I despised them all and I promised myself that when I grow up. i would develop a medicine to stop mothers from having ugly dolls. The witch doctors and faith healers in our town couldn't stop Mother from moking ugly dols. but I will. And now have grown up. In my quest to stop mothers from making ugly babies (my father threatened to stop me from schooling if i continue calling Mother's girls as ugly dolls. so now! call them ugly babies instead). I ended up in medical school. I become on obstetrician-gynecologist. I'm on my way to the delivery room for my first time to deliver an ugly baby. I still loathe babies. Ugly dolls that they are. Five hours later, I tapped the back of the newborn and a cry is heard. I stared at the helpless thing not realizing that tears are rolling down my cheeks again. This time, I smiled.
