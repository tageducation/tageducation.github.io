Imagine that you’re planning to take a trip. You begin by choosing a destination, and then you may consider the following questions: How will I get there? Where will I stay? What do I want to do when I arrive?
Conducting research is like planning for a trip. You begin by choosing a topic, so you know where you are headed with your research. Then you consider research questions to narrow the focus of your research to a central idea.
Write two possible research topics that you’re interested in learning more about, and explain why you are interested in these topics. Then write three research questions about each topic.</a>

                        <p><strong>Research questions are questions that must be answered by researchers in a research project, where the answers to research questions will help solve the research problem.</strong></p><p></p><p>To create a research question, the researcher must first determine what type of research will be carried out, whether it is <strong>qualitative, mixed,or quantitative research.</strong> the factors that can influence the research question are the timing of the research, how the research will be carried out, methodological approach,and research funding.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Problems in making research question</strong></p><p>The problem that often occurs when making research questions is that the questions asked are less specific, unclear, and often not critically worthwhile as research questions.</p><p>Although the topic or research issue raised is very interesting, if the questions are not good and are too trivial, the research will lose meaning for others.</p><p>If this happens, the benefits or impacts that will be given from the research will be reduced in value. Keep in mind that the most basic thing about research is how research can have an impact on other people. In this case, research means it must be interesting so that other people will be interested in reading it.</p><p></p><p><strong>Requirements for research questions</strong></p><p>In essence, research questions can be formulated by knowing the contradictions that occur between them.</p><p>-What is needed  and what is provided </p><p>-What should happen (prescriptive) and what actually happened (descriptive)</p><p>-What is desired and what is obtained </p><p></p><p>The first thing that is often present in research statements is the existence of a problem arising from a particular event or indication.

                        <p>I. Introduction</p><p>Self-Learning Modules, are learning activities designed for participants to do </p><p>independently when they are unable to attend individual or group education. Due to </p><p>the COVID-19 pandemic, students are abstained from going outside therefore, unable</p><p>to conduct face-to-face learning. The Department of Education (DepED)</p><p>implemented the Self-Learning modules for students to continue their studies and </p><p>cease from being held back. Although this has help students to carry on with their </p><p>education, some detest the Self-Learning Modules. Most of the complaints come from </p><p>students saying that there are too many academic work and projects that are being </p><p>given and are passed at a short amount of time, therefore, causing stress for students. </p><p>Another issue are the modules being distributed, some of the contents in modules are </p><p>lacking or some contain wording errors. The Department of Education however are </p><p>doing what they can to fix these errors and are intending to better their service to the </p><p>students and the people.</p><p>For teachers to know the amount of schoolwork and time they should give to students</p><p>it is best to know how many hours students consume when answering these SelfLearning</p><p>Modules. This helps students to be able to answer these modules without </p><p>worrying about the deadline due to huge amounts of school works and projects. </p><p>Students also have different learning capabilities; some might be able to quickly learn </p><p>a certain subject but struggle at the others. By conducting this research teachers can </p><p>help those students by giving them an amount of time to further study, learn, and </p><p>enjoy different subjects.</p><p></p><p>II. Purpose of the Study</p><p>The Department of Education implemented the Self-Learning Modules for students to </p><p>continue their studies, although some dislike the Self-Learning Modules. Mostly </p><p>because there is too much work ang only little amount of time is given to answer </p><p>these modules. The main purpose of this study is to help teachers know the right</p><p>amount of academic works and time to give to students. </p><p></p><p>III. Methods</p><p>The researcher used one subject(Mathematics) as basis and called or texted 20 of her </p><p>classmates and questioned them on how many hours they spent on answering 4 selflearning</p><p>modules on that specific subject. The researcher then used the mean to </p><p>analyze the data that was collected.</p><p></p><p>V. Discussion</p><p>Table 1 shows different number of hours the 20 students consumed on one subject</p><p>(Mathematics). This just show how one subject consumes one student’s time. This is </p><p>important for teachers to know that some students finished the module in a short </p><p>amount of time, while others consumed a great amount of time. By getting the mean </p><p>which is 4.8, a student should consume 1 hour on each module and 1 extra hour to </p><p>review and thoroughly understand the lesson, although this doesn’t include other </p><p>subjects only Mathematics, some might require a certain amount of time in order to </p><p>finish other subjects.</p><p></p><p>VI. Conclusion</p><p>The purpose of this study was to know the number of hours students would consume </p><p>when answering four(4) Self-Learning Modules in Mathematics in order for teachers </p><p>to know the amount of work and time to give students. </p><p>Based on the analysis conveyed, it can be concluded that some students require only a </p><p>short amount of time while other require a larger number of time for them to finish </p><p>their module. This shows that each student has a different learning capability</p><p></p><p>paki brainliest</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>A research question is 'a question that a research project sets out to answer'. Choosing a research question is an essential element of both quantitative and qualitative research. Investigation will require data collection and analysis, and the methodology for this will vary widely. Good research questions seek to improve knowledge on an important topic, and are usually narrow and specific.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

Imagine that you’re planning to take a trip. You begin by choosing a destination, and then you may consider the following questions: How will I get there? Where will I stay? What do I want to do when I arrive?
Conducting research is like planning for a trip. You begin by choosing a topic, so you know where you are headed with your research. Then you consider research questions to narrow the focus of your research to a central idea.
Write two possible research topics that you’re interested in learning more about, and explain why you are interested in these topics. Then write three research questions about each topic.</h2><br />

                        <p> <strong>Financial Management: The Prime Minister Dr. Singh is right in advocating   to fall Convertibility</strong></p><p></p><p>The Prime Minister Dr. Singh is right in advocating a phased movement to fall convertibility starting with Special Economics Zones (SEZs), We need to move along the convertibility highway, even if slowly, our economy is in take off stage and needs timely infusions of fixed and working capital. Since india is now an enterprise driven economy like most others, the Rupee needs to become more convertible to reduce transaction costs. Fears of a recurrence of the 1991 crisis, when our reserves were insufficient to finance 3 weeks imports are perhaps exaggerated. The currency has been ruling at below 47 to a dollar for the last 6 months. Investors and rating agencies are convinced that the india's growth. Story is here to stay, their views determine flows of FDI and FPI in a big way. Current account transactions no longer influence a country's BOP profile to the extent they did a couples of decades ago. Despite a ballooning trade deficit, our reserves have steadily increased over the years to 144 billion dollars.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Key Problems:</p><p>1. What is Capital Account Convertibility?</p><p>2. What are the risks in Capital Account Convertibility in Indian context?</p><p>3. What is the present status of Capital Account Convertibility in India?</p><p>4. Why Capital Account Convertibility?</p><p>5. What are advantages and benefits of Capital Account Convertibility?</p><p></p><p><strong>SULOTIONS:</strong></p><p>1. The freedom to convert the domestic currency into other internationally accepted currencies and vice versa at the market determined exchange rate. Capital account convertibility implies freedom of currency conversion related to capital inflows and outflows. Capital account convertibility is not just the currency convertibility freedom, but more than that, it involves the freedom to invest in financial assets of other countries. The committee on Capital Account Convertibility (1997, Chairman Dr. S.S. Tarapore) in its report have given a working definition for the CAC which is as following. "CAC refers to the freedom to current local financial assets into foreign financial assets and vice versa at market determined rates of exchange. It is associated with changes of ownership in foreign/domestic financial assets and liabilities and embodies the creation and liquidition of claim on, or by, the rest of the world. </p><p></p><p>2.  By Augost 1994 of International Monetary Fund (IMF's) article of agreement (Article No. VII) the committee on capital account convertibility, under Dr. S.S. Tarapore's Chairmanship, submitted its report in May 1997 and observed that international experience showed that a more open capital account could impose tremedous preserves on the financial system.</p><p>• Low Inflation rate</p><p>• Financial sector reforms</p><p>• A flexible exchange rate policy</p><p>• A stringent fiscal policy</p><p></p><p>3. There is partial capital account convertibility in India. Though tremedous capital account liberalisation measures were taken place since the launch of economic reforms, introduction of full capital account convertibility is yet to be implemented. In the case of current account there is full convertibility. Altogether, there is the rupee is partially convertible.</p><p></p><p>4. Countries prefer capital account convertibility to promote the inflow of foreign capital. Despite the various risks associated with capital flows like flunctuations in various segments of the financial markets, countries like India goes for it to get the advantage of using additional foreign capital.</p><p></p><p>5. There are some advantages and benefits of capital account convertibility like the following.       </p><p>• Export promotion - an important advantage of is that it encourage exports by increasing their profitability.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>RECOMMENDATION:</strong></p><p> We hereby recommend that, before adopting capital account convertibility (CAC), India should fulfill three crucial pre-conditions:</p><p>• Fiscal deficit should be reduced to 2% of GDP. The government shoul alone set up a Consolidated Sinking Fund (CSF) to reduce government debt.</p><p>• The government should fix the annual inflation target below 4%. This war called mandated inflation target and give foil freedom to RBI to use monetary weapons to achieve the inflation target.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>CONCLUSION:</strong></p><p>It can be conclude that the India has all time high foreign exchange reserve of 340bn, inflation within the control, moderate fiscal, depicit and highest growths rate in the whole world, so it's the requirement of the time that we allow full capital account convertibility to cash the benefits of globalisation. </p><p>          </p><p><strong>I</strong><strong> </strong><strong>H</strong><strong>O</strong><strong>P</strong><strong>E</strong><strong> </strong><strong>I</strong><strong>T</strong><strong> </strong><strong>W</strong><strong>I</strong><strong>L</strong><strong>L</strong><strong> </strong><strong>H</strong><strong>E</strong><strong>L</strong><strong>P</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Y</strong><strong>O</strong><strong>U</strong><strong> </strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>I. Introduction</p><p>Self-Learning Modules, are learning activities designed for participants to do </p><p>independently when they are unable to attend individual or group education. Due to </p><p>the COVID-19 pandemic, students are abstained from going outside therefore, unable</p><p>to conduct face-to-face learning. The Department of Education (DepED)</p><p>implemented the Self-Learning modules for students to continue their studies and </p><p>cease from being held back. Although this has help students to carry on with their </p><p>education, some detest the Self-Learning Modules. Most of the complaints come from </p><p>students saying that there are too many academic work and projects that are being </p><p>given and are passed at a short amount of time, therefore, causing stress for students. </p><p>Another issue are the modules being distributed, some of the contents in modules are </p><p>lacking or some contain wording errors. The Department of Education however are </p><p>doing what they can to fix these errors and are intending to better their service to the </p><p>students and the people.</p><p>For teachers to know the amount of schoolwork and time they should give to students</p><p>it is best to know how many hours students consume when answering these SelfLearning</p><p>Modules. This helps students to be able to answer these modules without </p><p>worrying about the deadline due to huge amounts of school works and projects. </p><p>Students also have different learning capabilities; some might be able to quickly learn </p><p>a certain subject but struggle at the others. By conducting this research teachers can </p><p>help those students by giving them an amount of time to further study, learn, and </p><p>enjoy different subjects.</p><p></p><p>II. Purpose of the Study</p><p>The Department of Education implemented the Self-Learning Modules for students to </p><p>continue their studies, although some dislike the Self-Learning Modules. Mostly </p><p>because there is too much work ang only little amount of time is given to answer </p><p>these modules. The main purpose of this study is to help teachers know the right</p><p>amount of academic works and time to give to students. </p><p></p><p>III. Methods</p><p>The researcher used one subject(Mathematics) as basis and called or texted 20 of her </p><p>classmates and questioned them on how many hours they spent on answering 4 selflearning</p><p>modules on that specific subject. The researcher then used the mean to </p><p>analyze the data that was collected.</p><p></p><p>V. Discussion</p><p>Table 1 shows different number of hours the 20 students consumed on one subject</p><p>(Mathematics). This just show how one subject consumes one student’s time. This is </p><p>important for teachers to know that some students finished the module in a short </p><p>amount of time, while others consumed a great amount of time. By getting the mean </p><p>which is 4.8, a student should consume 1 hour on each module and 1 extra hour to </p><p>review and thoroughly understand the lesson, although this doesn’t include other </p><p>subjects only Mathematics, some might require a certain amount of time in order to </p><p>finish other subjects.</p><p></p><p>VI. Conclusion</p><p>The purpose of this study was to know the number of hours students would consume </p><p>when answering four(4) Self-Learning Modules in Mathematics in order for teachers </p><p>to know the amount of work and time to give students. </p><p>Based on the analysis conveyed, it can be concluded that some students require only a </p><p>short amount of time while other require a larger number of time for them to finish </p><p>their module. This shows that each student has a different learning capability</p><br />
