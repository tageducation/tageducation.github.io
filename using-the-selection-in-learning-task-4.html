The story has these dispondent characters from the very start that almost give off a little bit of an eerie feel considering it is a Christmas story.

The author gave the characters life and clearly depicts a pair of lovers in despair but with a love so strong. Its almost uncanny that the author gave that kind of ending but for me, the real lesson there was the characters' lack of communication that made them have the decision of giving gifts which might eventually not be of use but the thought of it though is way bigger and what readers should pay attention to.<p></p><p></p>How I <strong>connect</strong> to the text------ personally, I am a giver by nature and I relate to the characters of this text.
