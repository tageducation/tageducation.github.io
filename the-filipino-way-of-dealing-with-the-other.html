                                            Lisa Gu visited the Philippines because she loves clear and pristine waters which the country is famous for. She went on a solo trip and planned to start her beach experience in Siargao Island. She arrived, brimming with excitement however she turned out seriously struggling to reach the hotel where she will be staying. It would have been helpful to her if she asked help from locals or authorities but Lisa is afraid of interacting with Filipinos. She has a belief that dark-skinned people have short temper and are likely to harm others if they get angry. She went on, walking in circles for hours and up in a Filipino restaurant. She saw a Korean tourist talking happily to a Filipino woman who appears to be the owner of the dining place. Witnessing how friendly and hospitable she is to the foreigner, Lisa felt regretful for misjudging Filipinos. She gathered enough confidence to ask help from the woman and instead of giving her the warm expression she was expecting, the woman gave her a cold message, "We don't accept Chinese people here. Because of you, COVID-19 arrived to the Philippines." Lisa heavy-heartedly retreated, too affected to speak a word. Lito, a Filipino resident in the area who happened to see everything, came forward and defended Lisa in the best polite way that he could, so his fellow Filipino would reflect on her actions. In the end, the woman apologized to Lisa which then was replied with words of gratitude from her. Lito and Lisa became friends and she opened up to him her negative judgments about Filipinos before which are now replaced with positive ones. 1.Who among the characters in the narrative is being biased?

Write down a happening from the narrative in which there is an existence of prejudice. 5. If you were Lito and you found out first about Lisa's negative views towards Filipinos, would you still defend her? Why? 6. Have you ever been hurt because of a biased treatment or were you judged by someone without even knowing you? How did it feel for you and how were you able to deal with it?  ​</a>

Filipino psychology, or Sikolohiyang Pilipino, in Filipino, is defined as the psychology rooted on the experience, ideas, and cultural orientation of the Filipinos. 2. Filipino Psychology emerged and grew as part of the nationalist indigenization movement in the Philippines that was formalized in 1975. 3. The roots of Filipino Psychology can be traced back to the introduction of the American education system in the Philippines. Agustin Alonzo was among the first Filipino psychologists to return from their education in America (in 1925) to teach at the College of Education in the University of the Philippines. 4. During the 1960s, many Filipino intellectuals and scholars were already aware of the limitations and incompatibility of Western Psychology; western-oriented approaches in research in particular, had led scholars to paint the Filipino through the “judgmental and impressionistic views of the colonizers.5. It is with the use of American categories and standards that "the native Filipino invariably suffers from the comparison in not too subtle attempts to put forward Western behavior patterns as models for the Filipino."6. Early efforts to correct the traditional way of teaching and studying psychology in the 1960s include the translation of foreign materials and the use of the Filipino language as a mode of instruction, however, these efforts fail to address the problems brought about by colonial psychology as these efforts were sparse and not collaborated upon by psychologists. 7. It was only in the 1970s that a concerted effort to address colonial psychology in the form of Filipin Psychology took place. Filipino Psychology, along with advances in Filipinology and similarly History's Pantayong Pananaw, was led by Virgilio Enriquez, Prospero Covar, and Zeus A.

                                            empowerment Analysis of these figures in relation to previous global gender gap reports may lead to the conclusion that the gap will finally close in a span of 82 years (World EconomicForum, 2016)The Philippines elected not one, but two women presidents in a span of less than 20 years. The first was Corazon "Cory" Cojuangco Aquino, who was installed in 1986 following the snap electionsorchestrated by the dictator Ferdinand Marcos, Sr. From 1998 to 2013, the Philippines showed acontinuous increase of elected officials from 16.15% in 1998 to 19.92% in 2013. Considered a good indicator of increasing women politicalparticipation in the country, two out of the five presidential candidates in the 2016 elections were womenAt the grassroots, women's organizations and NGOs mainstreamed gender issues in community organizing to ensure active participation of in local government units and communities Community-based NGOs and peoples' organizations played significant roles that enabled empowerment for women in thecommunities and articulate their interests in various levels of decision making.However, the dominant patriarchal framework of politics and governance has made it hard for women to assert themselves in traditional centersof power like states, courts of law, congresses, and even local governments. While Left organizations have turned their attention to women's issues and recognized the equal importance of the reproductive and productivespheres, women's issues - especially those dealing with sexuality - are still marginalized in the discourse on social transformation. Divorce and abortion are issues that remain to be absent in the debates among other social movements.The Filipino women's movement has come a long way, but still has miles to go,so to speak.Evidence 1Evidence 2 Reason #2 Evidence 1Evidence 2Reason #3Evidence 1Conflict: Evidence 1,2 &amp;3 Conclusion:Pa tulong naman po pleaseee thank you po​</a>

                            16. Lisa Gu visited the Philippines because she loves clear and pristine waters which the country is famous for. She went on a solo trip and planned to start her beach experience in Siargao Island. She arrived, brimming with excitement however she turned out seriously struggling to reach the hotel where she will be staying. It would have been helpful to her if she asked help from locals or authorities but Lisa is afraid of interacting with Filipinos. She has a belief that dark-skinned people have short temper and are likely to harm others if they get angry. She went on, walking in circles for hours and up in a Filipino restaurant. She saw a Korean tourist talking happily to a Filipino woman who appears to be the owner of the dining place. Witnessing how friendly and hospitable she is to the foreigner, Lisa felt regretful for misjudging Filipinos. She gathered enough confidence to ask help from the woman and instead of giving her the warm expression she was expecting, the woman gave her a cold message, "We don't accept Chinese people here. Because of you, COVID-19 arrived to the Philippines." Lisa heavy-heartedly retreated, too affected to speak a word. Lito, a Filipino resident in the area who happened to see everything, came forward and defended Lisa in the best polite way that he could, so his fellow Filipino would reflect on her actions. In the end, the woman apologized to Lisa which then was replied with words of gratitude from her. Lito and Lisa became friends and she opened up to him her negative judgments about Filipinos before which are now replaced with positive ones. 1.Who among the characters in the narrative is being biased? A.Lito B.Lisa C.Owner of the restaurant D.Both A and C 2. Who among the characters in the narrative has prejudice towards others? A.Lisa B.Owner of the restaurant C.Lito D.Both A and B 3.Write down a happening from the narrative in which a person is in the state of being blased. 4. Write down a happening from the narrative in which there is an existence of prejudice. 5. If you were Lito and you found out first about Lisa's negative views towards Filipinos, would you still defend her? Why? 6. Have you ever been hurt because of a biased treatment or were you judged by someone without even knowing you? How did it feel for you and how were you able to deal with it?  ​</h2><br />

Filipino psychology, or Sikolohiyang Pilipino, in Filipino, is defined as the psychology rooted on the experience, ideas, and cultural orientation of the Filipinos. 2. Filipino Psychology emerged and grew as part of the nationalist indigenization movement in the Philippines that was formalized in 1975. 3. The roots of Filipino Psychology can be traced back to the introduction of the American education system in the Philippines. Agustin Alonzo was among the first Filipino psychologists to return from their education in America (in 1925) to teach at the College of Education in the University of the Philippines. 4. During the 1960s, many Filipino intellectuals and scholars were already aware of the limitations and incompatibility of Western Psychology; western-oriented approaches in research in particular, had led scholars to paint the Filipino through the “judgmental and impressionistic views of the colonizers.5. It is with the use of American categories and standards that "the native Filipino invariably suffers from the comparison in not too subtle attempts to put forward Western behavior patterns as models for the Filipino."6. Early efforts to correct the traditional way of teaching and studying psychology in the 1960s include the translation of foreign materials and the use of the Filipino language as a mode of instruction, however, these efforts fail to address the problems brought about by colonial psychology as these efforts were sparse and not collaborated upon by psychologists. 7. It was only in the 1970s that a concerted effort to address colonial psychology in the form of Filipin Psychology took place. Filipino Psychology, along with advances in Filipinology and similarly History's Pantayong Pananaw, was led by Virgilio Enriquez, Prospero Covar, and Zeus A. Salazar in the indigenization movement of their respective fields. 8. Kapwa is the core construct of Filipino Psychology. Kapwa has two categories, Ibang Tao and Hindi Ibang Tao. Core value or Kapwa (Shared inner self) 9. (Pivotal interpersonal value) Pakiramdam: Shared inner perceptions. Filipinos use damdam, or the inner perception of others' emotions, as a basic tool to guide their dealings with other people. 10.(Societal Values) Karangalan: Loosely translated to dignity, this actually refers to what other people see in a person and how they use that information to make a stand or judge about his/her worth.​</h2><br />

The first was Corazon "Cory" Cojuangco Aquino, who was installed in 1986 following the snap electionsorchestrated by the dictator Ferdinand Marcos, Sr. From 1998 to 2013, the Philippines showed acontinuous increase of elected officials from 16.15% in 1998 to 19.92% in 2013. Considered a good indicator of increasing women politicalparticipation in the country, two out of the five presidential candidates in the 2016 elections were womenAt the grassroots, women's organizations and NGOs mainstreamed gender issues in community organizing to ensure active participation of in local government units and communities Community-based NGOs and peoples' organizations played significant roles that enabled empowerment for women in thecommunities and articulate their interests in various levels of decision making.However, the dominant patriarchal framework of politics and governance has made it hard for women to assert themselves in traditional centersof power like states, courts of law, congresses, and even local governments. While Left organizations have turned their attention to women's issues and recognized the equal importance of the reproductive and productivespheres, women's issues - especially those dealing with sexuality - are still marginalized in the discourse on social transformation. Divorce and abortion are issues that remain to be absent in the debates among other social movements.The Filipino women's movement has come a long way, but still has miles to go,so to speak.Evidence 1Evidence 2 Reason #2 Evidence 1Evidence 2Reason #3Evidence 1Conflict: Evidence 1,2 &amp;3 Conclusion:Pa tulong naman po pleaseee thank you po​</h2><br />
