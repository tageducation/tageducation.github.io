                                            what emotions are more easily expressed with family than with non relatives Answer: For me, family is the easiest to express because when you have a problem, for example with my grades, I tell my family that I am failing in my other subjects, they understand Family also makes my life happy because they are the ones I see every day every time I come home from school, they are the ones who make me happy even though our life is difficult. When it's non-relatives, it's because he won't talk to you too much, for example, if you have a problem, he won't give you advice, but when you're family, it's because that's where they'll pour their love, happiness and Take care everyday. pa like po ​</a>

                                            interpret by using the elements of a short story                The Diary of the Girl Dear Diary.          It was a very cold winter when the breath of the light of home was taken back by the Giver of life. I was out in the dark during that time. The moon keeps on smiling but suddenly it cried. I have cried out so loud from the envelope of love and caress. At the same time, the deafening silence of the great woman cornered the four sides of the white room. Together with the men and women in white, is the pillar of home. Yes, he was left alone, just with me, with that day of tears, sorrow and melancholy. But he, knowing I am the cause of the decease of his dearly love, his flower of delight since high school of loyalty and honesty, with love and tenderness, with sacrifice and devotion, he poses that smile of inspiring and motivating love as I was going out of the school. It seems he always misses me after eight hours stay inside that highly-cost home of human knowledge and wisdom. He holds and carries me in his strong arms as he turns me once or twice around. He kisses me with his beard that tickles my thin skin. But the feeling is different. I love it. Yes, he was left alone with only a piece of land inherited from his deceased parents (which was sold when I was out to light) since my mom's family defied him for his indigence and misfortune. He was alone. He works nine or ten hours a day in that factory of not-so-popular cloth trade. His pay is just a little. However, his money is like abundant leaves. I was wondering how he pays our rent, our water, our food, my ice cream, my Barbie, my tiny thick uniform, my candies, my chocolates and my pretty toys. Sometimes, I ask the air, "Where on earth my dad get lots of money?" Isn't it surprising? Yes it is. It is really surprising that my dad pretends to be happy though I am the cause of his heartaches when mom died. Yes he is rich because he pretends to be someone because he wants me to be happy at all times. He pretends not to be tired because he wants me to be good at school. He makes me laugh because he does not want me to be lonely. And most of all, he wants me to smile because when I do, his pain will go away. Sometimes, he holds his stomach. I know it is empty for the whole day. How I wish that time must fly so fast so I could accompany him to bear his burdens. I knew it then. I knew that his joy is me. He sacrifices, he lies and he pretends because I am the only fruit of his sweet long love from the great woman whom I owe my life- my mom. How touching for a little girl like me with five and four years in this world! Though innocent, I feel the warm caress and tender touch, sweetest smile and eyes so bright of my dad. This is Sharina, leaving you of the greetings, "Happy Father's Day! Love your dad unconditionally!"​</a>

                                            2. I love to stay on our family rest house near the farm of my Grandparents. When I was a child, I used to stay there for a long time together with my cousins. There we play some of our traditional games such as Tumbang Preso, Agawan Base, Hide and Seek and other games. We enjoy it so much and it made our vacation so much memories to remember. These memories will remain in our hearts forever. Now that I am growing older, I wish I could go back to those happy memories that we've been in our childhood. Pronouns: Point of View: 3. My vacation in the farm is perfect. The whole family stayed there for one month. We helped our father in harvesting fruits and vegetables. We also helped our mother in cooking our food. I learned many things about cooking. I enjoyed my vacation very much. Next year, the whole family will stay there again. Pronouns: Point of View:4.You like to walk everyday because it makes me feel energetic. A vigorous walk makes your heart beats faster. Your doctor told you that during exercise,the heart pumps more oxygen to your body. Aside from this,you enjoy walking because it makes you appreciate nature more. Thea sights and sound along the way make you really happy.Pronouns:Point of view:5. Sandra woke up and picked out her clothes for school. Arriving at thea school she went to her locker to get her books and met her friend susan on her way to the canteen. back then, Sandra worked in her assignments and watched tv while her mom did the dishes.

                                            Dear Mom, I think we should get a pet dog. Dogs make great pets because they are loyal. They help deter criminals, like thieves. They also make people happy because they are playful and friendly. Doctors have even found that owning a dog can improve a person's health. They reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and they help prevent allergies, asthma and eczema in children! You might think that I am not responsible enough to have a pet dog. But, I have demonstrated responsibility by making my bed every morning and doing my homework every afternoon. I know that I would be responsible for walking our pet dog and cleaning up after it. Getting a pet dog would be good for our family! I hope you will consider my request. Please Mom! Love, NatalieClaim:reason:counterclaim:counterargument:​</a>

Our family usually eats, works, and attends mass together. We spend quality time with each other. An unforgettable event happened last year. I was awarded a medal and a certificate for being one of the academic excellence awardees. My parents were very proud of me. They were so happy that they decided to have a family outing. I thanked God for such a blessing. I was happy because my efforts paid off. Eleven years from now, I shall be a teacher like my mother. I will help in shaping the future. I will bring out the best in my pupils so they will be knowledgeable, skillful, and service-oriented, thus, becoming productive citizens of our country. To make this happen, I shall do my best in my studies. I shall face the challenges that await me. With God's help and my determination, I know my dream will come true.​</a>

No question about it. I have great respectwith my great elders and my teachers. However, these oldgenerations are so quick to nag me.

What can I do? Life is a little bitcomplicated. Don't you think so?When people around look at me, I feel like I am mini-humanbeing. They want me to act like a mature person but they won'tallow me to make decisions. They tell me to speak up but I can'tblurt out my feelings. I've got my rights also, but when can I use it?I'm just having a loud thinking.Everyone is expected to have a plan. Ask me, I've got minetoo. You know sometimes, I think I should only dream, not plananymore. Do you know why? It is because others keep butting in.Before I know it, their dreams and plans are the ones I am workingand doing.

                            8. interpret by using the elements of a short story                The Diary of the Girl Dear Diary.          It was a very cold winter when the breath of the light of home was taken back by the Giver of life. I was out in the dark during that time. The moon keeps on smiling but suddenly it cried. I have cried out so loud from the envelope of love and caress. At the same time, the deafening silence of the great woman cornered the four sides of the white room. Together with the men and women in white, is the pillar of home. Yes, he was left alone, just with me, with that day of tears, sorrow and melancholy. But he, knowing I am the cause of the decease of his dearly love, his flower of delight since high school of loyalty and honesty, with love and tenderness, with sacrifice and devotion, he poses that smile of inspiring and motivating love as I was going out of the school. It seems he always misses me after eight hours stay inside that highly-cost home of human knowledge and wisdom. He holds and carries me in his strong arms as he turns me once or twice around. He kisses me with his beard that tickles my thin skin. But the feeling is different. I love it. Yes, he was left alone with only a piece of land inherited from his deceased parents (which was sold when I was out to light) since my mom's family defied him for his indigence and misfortune. He was alone. He works nine or ten hours a day in that factory of not-so-popular cloth trade. His pay is just a little. However, his money is like abundant leaves. I was wondering how he pays our rent, our water, our food, my ice cream, my Barbie, my tiny thick uniform, my candies, my chocolates and my pretty toys. Sometimes, I ask the air, "Where on earth my dad get lots of money?" Isn't it surprising? Yes it is. It is really surprising that my dad pretends to be happy though I am the cause of his heartaches when mom died. Yes he is rich because he pretends to be someone because he wants me to be happy at all times. He pretends not to be tired because he wants me to be good at school. He makes me laugh because he does not want me to be lonely. And most of all, he wants me to smile because when I do, his pain will go away. Sometimes, he holds his stomach. I know it is empty for the whole day. How I wish that time must fly so fast so I could accompany him to bear his burdens. I knew it then. I knew that his joy is me. He sacrifices, he lies and he pretends because I am the only fruit of his sweet long love from the great woman whom I owe my life- my mom. How touching for a little girl like me with five and four years in this world! Though innocent, I feel the warm caress and tender touch, sweetest smile and eyes so bright of my dad. This is Sharina, leaving you of the greetings, "Happy Father's Day! Love your dad unconditionally!"​</h2><br />

                            11. 2. I love to stay on our family rest house near the farm of my Grandparents. When I was a child, I used to stay there for a long time together with my cousins. There we play some of our traditional games such as Tumbang Preso, Agawan Base, Hide and Seek and other games. We enjoy it so much and it made our vacation so much memories to remember. These memories will remain in our hearts forever. Now that I am growing older, I wish I could go back to those happy memories that we've been in our childhood. Pronouns: Point of View: 3. My vacation in the farm is perfect. The whole family stayed there for one month. We helped our father in harvesting fruits and vegetables. We also helped our mother in cooking our food. I learned many things about cooking. I enjoyed my vacation very much. Next year, the whole family will stay there again. Pronouns: Point of View:4.You like to walk everyday because it makes me feel energetic. A vigorous walk makes your heart beats faster. Your doctor told you that during exercise,the heart pumps more oxygen to your body. Aside from this,you enjoy walking because it makes you appreciate nature more. Thea sights and sound along the way make you really happy.Pronouns:Point of view:5. Sandra woke up and picked out her clothes for school.

                            12. Dear Mom, I think we should get a pet dog. Dogs make great pets because they are loyal. They help deter criminals, like thieves. They also make people happy because they are playful and friendly. Doctors have even found that owning a dog can improve a person's health. They reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and they help prevent allergies, asthma and eczema in children! You might think that I am not responsible enough to have a pet dog. But, I have demonstrated responsibility by making my bed every morning and doing my homework every afternoon. I know that I would be responsible for walking our pet dog and cleaning up after it. Getting a pet dog would be good for our family! I hope you will consider my request. Please Mom! Love, NatalieClaim:reason:counterclaim:counterargument:​</h2><br />

Underlined words that shows the past tense, encircle if present tense and box if it shows future tense. Who Am I? I am Maria Antonetta C. Realonda and I live in Antipolo City. My father works as a manager in Puregold while my mother teaches in a public elementary school. I am the youngest in the family. I have three brothers and two sisters. Our family usually eats, works, and attends mass together. We spend quality time with each other. An unforgettable event happened last year. I was awarded a medal and a certificate for being one of the academic excellence awardees. My parents were very proud of me. They were so happy that they decided to have a family outing. I thanked God for such a blessing. I was happy because my efforts paid off. Eleven years from now, I shall be a teacher like my mother. I will help in shaping the future. I will bring out the best in my pupils so they will be knowledgeable, skillful, and service-oriented, thus, becoming productive citizens of our country. To make this happen, I shall do my best in my studies. I shall face the challenges that await me. With God's help and my determination, I know my dream will come true.​</h2><br />
                        How do I know myself? I’m not quite sure, because sometimes small things can make me angry. <br />But I know I will be able to manage it. I like to paint, draw, do crochets, and do some other fun activities. Sometimes, I may be scared trying new things but it is not bad because my family always cheers me up. <br />When talking about rights and wrongs. I have every right to fulfill my needs, but not my wants. I have every right to my freedom of speech, but hate speech isn’t free speech. I have every right to have an education, but use it as a key to help those who need help with knowledge. I have every right to play but have time management so I can do my responsibilities. I have every right to criticize the wrongdoings of the government but praise them whenever I see that they are doing the right thing. <br /><br />

                        The answers below would be capitalised. <br /><br /><br />We are only a small family BUT we are the happiest. <br />THOUGH my dad only earns a minimum wage from being an office clerk, he still managed to buy an expensive dress for my mom, toys for my little sister, and painting tools for me. FURTHERMORE, he manages to set a date for us to go to the community zoo where I'm super excited to go next weekend. <br /><br />My mom ON THE OTHER HAND, is the most talented mother in the world. <br />BECAUSE of her, I am now inspired to paint. <br />IN FACT, my mother posted all of my artworks in the living room where the visitors are free to judge which I'm cool with. <br />INSTEAD of getting dirty and sweaty outside, I prefer to stay at home and work on my paintings through my imaginations. <br /><br />DUE TO my dad's reassignment, we can't go to the zoo anymore. BESIDES mom also needed the money to pay the bills at home. <br />I was sad BUT what keeps me happy is knowing that I have an amazing family. MOREOVER we could always spend time together at home. BESIDES when I grow up, I'd make sure to look for a high paying job, earn a lot of money SO THAT I could travel the world with my family. <br />

                            30. I am Dina. I was 16 when mum took me out of school saying we had to travel to Pakistan to sort out some property issues. "At first I was happy to get out of school before the holidays and had never been on a plane before, but that all soon changed... "I was told we were heading to a family wedding for a cousin I hadn't met. Mum had packed a bag for me, saying it was because we were staying there for a few days after the ceremony. "Once I was there, I was told that it was my wedding. I would be forced to get marriage. I cried, told mum I was too young, he was too old, I hadn't finished school, and I was scared and didn't want to do it. It was like she didn't care. How i felt towards Dina:My advice to Dina:​</h2><br />
