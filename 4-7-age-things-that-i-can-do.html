Between the ages of 4 and 7, children become very interested and ask a lot of questions, indicating that they are starting to use primitive reasoning. There is a resurgence of interest in logic and the need to understand why things are the way they are (Piaget, 1890).B. In a learning mechanism known as classical conditioning, a biologically potent stimulus (e.g. food) is paired with a hitherto neutral stimulus (e.g. a bell) (Pavlov, 1897).C. Centration is the act of concentrating all of one's attention on one aspect or characteristic of a situation while ignoring all others (Piaget, 1890).D. The first stage of Erikson's (1950) theory focuses on how the parents or caregivers meet the infant's basic needs and how this relationship leads to trust or distrust.E. The Mozart effect is the idea that listening to classical music will temporarily improve IQ test scores on one section (Rauscher et al. 1993).F. Social learning theory is a learning and social behavior theory that argues that new habits can be learned by watching and imitating others (Bandura, 1971).G. Operant conditioning is a method of learning that uses incentives and punishments to motivate people to learn. This form of conditioning assumes that an action and a result, such as a reward or punishment, have a causal relationship that leads to learning (Skinner, 1938).H. The physiological need, according to Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs (1954), is a term developed to clarify and cultivate the basis for motivation. The key physical prerequisite for human existence is this definition.I. Rather than describing intelligence as a single, general capacity, the theory of multiple intelligences suggests that human intelligence be divided into distinct "modalities of intelligence" (Gardner, 1983).FOR THE LAST HELP ME, I NEED TO SUMBIT THIS TODAY HOPE U CAN HELP ME​</a>

It reminds you to treat your first conclusion as one ofseveral possible conclusions. It reminds you to gather evidence to support your conclusion10. The five steps in the scientific method begin by questioning an observation, andend with a conclusion that is based on evidence. Step 1 in the scientific method is to ask a question about your observation.Step 2 is to state a possible answer to the question, or a hypothesis. Step 3 is to test the hypothesis. Step 4 is to think aboutthe findings--think about what happened when you tested the hypothesis. Step 5 is to draw a conclusion.​</a>

“Be proud of being a Filipino (even if it is not easy)” 
From INQUIRER.net / 04:50 PM June 12, 2015 
– Jen Denielle R. Hernandez, Grade 9 
What is the best the thing I have done for my country? I actually don’t know because at my age, it is impossible to do something big. Then I realized it isn’t 
important on how big it is. I think the best thing I’ve done for my country is to be proud that I am a Filipino. 
Being proud that I am a Filipino is not quite easy. Sometimes, I even doubt it because of our government. The people have to rally on the streets to get what they want. I feel like it is telling me that we have to go to war first before we can gain peace. When I was in Grade 7, we studied Philippine history. I then appreciated peace. It was not just about the Filipinos fighting the Spanish but how we fought for our independence. 
Now, if someone will ask me what is the best thing that I have done for our country, I will tell him or her that I am proud to be a Filipino. 
QUESTIONS: 
1. What is the best thing that the writer has done for the country? ________________________________________________________________ 
2. According to the writer, why is it impossible to do something big? ________________________________________________________________ 
3. What does “proud” mean? 
________________________________________________________________ 
4. Do you agree when she said that she is a proud Filipino?

5. Are you a proud Filipino? What makes you proud as a Filipino? _______________________________________________________________</a>

Between the ages of 4 and 7, children become very interested and ask a lot of questions, indicating that they are starting to use primitive reasoning. There is a resurgence of interest in logic and the need to understand why things are the way they are (Piaget, 1890).B. In a learning mechanism known as classical conditioning, a biologically potent stimulus (e.g. food) is paired with a hitherto neutral stimulus (e.g. a bell) (Pavlov, 1897).C. Centration is the act of concentrating all of one's attention on one aspect or characteristic of a situation while ignoring all others (Piaget, 1890).D. The first stage of Erikson's (1950) theory focuses on how the parents or caregivers meet the infant's basic needs and how this relationship leads to trust or distrust.E. The Mozart effect is the idea that listening to classical music will temporarily improve IQ test scores on one section (Rauscher et al. 1993).F. Social learning theory is a learning and social behavior theory that argues that new habits can be learned by watching and imitating others (Bandura, 1971).G. Operant conditioning is a method of learning that uses incentives and punishments to motivate people to learn. This form of conditioning assumes that an action and a result, such as a reward or punishment, have a causal relationship that leads to learning (Skinner, 1938).H. The physiological need, according to Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs (1954), is a term developed to clarify and cultivate the basis for motivation. The key physical prerequisite for human existence is this definition.I. Rather than describing intelligence as a single, general capacity, the theory of multiple intelligences suggests that human intelligence be divided into distinct "modalities of intelligence" (Gardner, 1983).FOR THE LAST HELP ME, I NEED TO SUMBIT THIS TODAY HOPE U CAN HELP ME​</h2><br />

I believe that would be the most suitable advice and recommendation you can hear from someone my age. 6) ________, follow always unto what you really want. 7) _______, I would like to highlight is the crucial value of your dreams as, like the great Steve Jobs pointed out, the way to success is to "dream bigger", and this tool is available for everyone. There has barely been one person in the world that had never failed, so, you, most probably, will not become such an exception. 8)_______, do not limit yourself by the fear of losing, you will lose one day anyway, and this occasion is unpredictable and unpreventable. It may sound absolutely discouraging but have a think about it: if there is nothing to hold you back, everything is possible. With this in mind, make a bold, confident, and reckless step in the life, hurry to fall, 9)_________ the sooner you will do this, the more time you will have for getting back to the top. 10)________ do not let the obstacles and failures stop you as they are just other twists of a great life adventure you are to embark on and we are looking forward to witness. Thank you and congratulations!​</h2><br />

“Be proud of being a Filipino (even if it is not easy)” 
From INQUIRER.net / 04:50 PM June 12, 2015 
– Jen Denielle R. Hernandez, Grade 9 
What is the best the thing I have done for my country? I actually don’t know because at my age, it is impossible to do something big. Then I realized it isn’t 
important on how big it is. I think the best thing I’ve done for my country is to be proud that I am a Filipino. 
Being proud that I am a Filipino is not quite easy. Sometimes, I even doubt it because of our government. The people have to rally on the streets to get what they want. I feel like it is telling me that we have to go to war first before we can gain peace. When I was in Grade 7, we studied Philippine history. I then appreciated peace. It was not just about the Filipinos fighting the Spanish but how we fought for our independence. 
Now, if someone will ask me what is the best thing that I have done for our country, I will tell him or her that I am proud to be a Filipino.

1. What is the best thing that the writer has done for the country? ________________________________________________________________ 
2. According to the writer, why is it impossible to do something big? ________________________________________________________________ 
3. What does “proud” mean?
