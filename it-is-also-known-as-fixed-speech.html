It uses the complex grammatical sentence structure and vocabulary that are only known by experts in that field. Formal Style This type uses formal words and expressions and is mostly seen in writing rather than speaking. It also disallows the use of ellipsis, contractions, and qualifying modal adverbials.Consultative StyleThe third level of language. It is basically unplanned speech since the speaker uses the participation and feedback of the listener. The speaker will supply background information, while again, the listener participates continuously. Casual StyleAlso known as informal style, it is usually used between, friends, or even insiders who have things to share. In this type, there is a free and easy participation of both speaker and listener.(need ko lang i-copy paste) ​</a>

                            3. It is an impersonal speech style or also known as fixed speech</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>These two may be different - one is formal the other is frozen speech<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>An impersonal speech style could be characteristic of a formal speech which is different from a fixed or frozen speech. They could also be one in the same as in the case of well-known historical speeches by politicians. </p><p></p><p>But what makes the two different?</p><p></p><p>A <strong>formal speech</strong> is a speech that is typically presented to an audience without visual aids, though this trend is changing now because we have the available technology--so speech presenters are now using more and more visual aids. The purpose of a formal speech is  to inform the audience, persuade, maybe entertain and to stimulate action or interest from the viewers or listeners. An example of this is the State of the Nation Address where the President informs the public of how we are doing as a nation, lays out his or her legislative agenda for the next year and at the same time, persuades the Congress to go with his legislative agenda. This type of speech is usually one way.</p><p></p><p>A <strong>frozen speech</strong>, on the other hand, is also formal and could be impersonal but the main  reason why this is frozen is that the text used here are usually dated and fixed. In a mass, for example, what the priests says 90% of the time is fixed speech since he merely reads from a book. The same goes when we sing the national anthem, it is fixed. </p><p></p><p>But either of these two can be used, depending on the occasion and the purpose of the speaker. </p><p></p><p><strong>For more information:</strong></p><p>Frozen Speech Examples and other Types of Speeches: https://brainly.ph/question/1796702</p><br />
