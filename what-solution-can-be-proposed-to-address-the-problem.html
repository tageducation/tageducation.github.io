The researcher may consider what was wrong or incomplete about prior efforts conducted on the same problem.3. The proposed study can still be conducted even if there are already sufficient solutions to the given problem.4. Providing justifications does not require reasoning skills and processes.5. An anecdote or evidence from personal experience can serve as a valid justification.6. It will be more reasonable to conduct research if there is no urgent need to solve the existing problem.7. The researcher needs to provide the readers with critical background or contextual information that introduces the research topic.8. Validity of justification can be expressed by reffering to a policy, press report, or other reputable information source.9. The study must relate to either local or global context, or both.10.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Pollution is the introduction of contaminants into the natural environment that cause adverse changeuse less toxic raw materials or fuel, use a less polluting industrial process and to improve the infeciency of the process. WHO estimates that around 7 million people die every year from exposure to fine particles in polluted air that lead to diseases such as stroke, heart disease, lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases and respiratory infections, including pneumonia.Cebu Province recorded the highest number of registered deaths with 4,947 or 39 percent. Second was Negros Oriental with 2,430 or 19 percent. Meanwhile, Siquijor had the lowest number of registered deaths with 209 or 1 percent only. Fossil fuel and coal are the main contributors to air pollutio n. Therefore, opting for alternative or renewable energy sources to produce power presents a practical solution to air pollution. <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>and the 4 and 5 i dint search it i learned it</p><p>hope it helps</p><br />

When ozone forms air pollution, it's also called smog. Some air pollutants are poisonous. </p><p>2. Reducing pollutants in the air can make human and the environment healthy. It can less harmful effects on human health, particularly the respiratory and cardiovascular systems. lastly, if it will manage and controlled the damage on the plants and buildings, and smoke or haze can reduce.</p><p>3. Air pollution kills an estimated seven million people worldwide every year. It shows that 9 out of 10 people breathe air that exceeds limits containing high levels of pollutants.</p><p>5. More than 90% of air pollution-related deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries, mainly in Asia and Africa, followed by low- and middle-income countries of the Eastern Mediterranean region, Europe and the Americas. The least polluted country is Sweden with overall score of 2.8/10. The amount of carbon dioxide is 3.83 tonnes per capita per year.</p><p>6.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Air pollution is a mixture of solid particles and gases in the air. Car emissions, chemicals from factories, dust, pollen and mold spores may be suspended as particles. Ozone, a gas, is a major part of air pollution in cities. When ozone forms air pollution, it's also called smog. Some air pollutants are poisonous.</p><p>2. Reduce the number of trips you take in your car. Reduce or eliminate fireplace and wood stove use. Avoid burning leaves, trash, and other materials. Avoid using gas-powered lawn and garden equipment.</p><p>3. Air pollution kills an estimated seven million people worldwide every year. WHO data shows that 9 out of 10 people breathe air that exceeds WHO guideline limits containing high levels of pollutants, with low- and middle-income countries suffering from the highest exposures.</p><p>4. Western Pacific and SouthEast Asia.</p><p>5. Reduce the number of trips you take in your car. Reduce or eliminate fireplace and wood stove use. Avoid burning leaves, trash, and other materials.

what solution can be proposed to address the problem?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The most basic solution for air pollution is to move away from fossil fuels, replacing them with alternative energies like solar, wind and geothermal. Producing clean energy is crucial. But equally important is to reduce our consumption of energy by adopting responsible habits and using more efficient devices.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Paglaum nga Makatabang Kini</p><p></p><p></p><p>#CarryOnLearning</p><br />
