It was only after a few days  when we found out the result and my mom was in deep anxiety and anger with my dad. I asked them to talk about it. I told my mom to think of the happy memories they have as husband and wife so that she can only have positive thoughts. My dad was scared as he was also depressed. I told them to show respect for each other emotions and we should act as one in this trying time. It took a while before we finally resolved the problem but what was important is that we had them tested again same as the whole family household and thank God that after the quarantine period everyone tested negative already. #BrainlyFast</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />
