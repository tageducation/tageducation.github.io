                                            Activity 2.5: Should we treat the patient?
A patient has been admitted to the accident and emergency department after a road traffic accident. He has sustained some severe injuries and requires a blood transfusion. He is conscious and understands the nature of his injuries and the need for a life-saving blood transfusion. However, he refuses to consent to such treatment despite being fully aware that his life is at risk. In about an hour he will lapse into unconsciousness and eventually die. His wife and two children have arrived at the hospital and they are all begging the doctor in charge of his treatment to save his life. They are obviously very distressed at the thought of possibly losing someone they all love. However, the doctor decides not to administer the blood transfusion even if this will lead to the man’s death. Write down what moral issues may arise from this scenario. Then write down what you believe should be done in this situation and why.</a>

                                            Try these following jokes. Note and explain the fallacies being incurred
1. Always Cautious 
A car hits an old lady while she is crossing the street. She experiences only minor injuries. The driver protests, “It is not my fault. I’m a very cautious driver. I have been driving for six years.” “It’s not my fault either. I’m also a cautious person. And I have been walking for 60 years.”
2. Medical Skill 
Three surgeons are trying to impress each other with their achievements. First surgeon: “I operated on the arm of this guy and he has become a famous basketball player.” Second surgeon: “I operated on the leg of this guy and now he’s a world-famous marathon runner!” Third Surgeon: “That’s nothing. I fixed the smile on the face this idiot and now he’s a congressman!”
3. Strict Distinction 
A doctor asks his patient: “How many hours do you sleep every day?” “At most five hours.” “That is too few.” “It is enough. I sleep another 8 hours in the evening.
Duty-bound
Boss: “This is an extremely important position. We need a very responsible person.” Applicant: “Then I am the person you are looking for. In all the companies I worked for in the past, as soon as there is a problem, I was always responsible for it.”
4. So Strong 
Jack thinks that he is the strongest military man in the camp. Once he drank up to five bottles of whisky and started to bother the other customers. He orders another bottle of whiskey but the waiter hesitates to give it to him. “Listen. Give me one more bottle. Otherwise I will be angry. I may destroy this bar.” With that, he bangs his fist on the counter. Quickly right after he does this, a strong earthquake hits. When Jack wakes up on top of a heap of rubble he thinks it over and talks to himself with a smile: “By golly. I never knew I was so strong.”</a>

Having injuries mean that a human is harm and must be healed to prevent further or permanent damage. Injuries also differ in urgency. Some injuries require immediate attention but some injuries are less grave than the others. Injuries are caused by accidents or overworking, causing strain in muscles or even the eyes. Having injuries limit the capability of a person to work. Treating injuries require knowledge from trained people such as doctors, nurses, and first-aid personnel. Injuries happen unexpectedly so on our part, it is important to be careful in whatever we do.</p><br />

                            12. Activity 2.5: Should we treat the patient?
A patient has been admitted to the accident and emergency department after a road traffic accident. He has sustained some severe injuries and requires a blood transfusion. He is conscious and understands the nature of his injuries and the need for a life-saving blood transfusion. However, he refuses to consent to such treatment despite being fully aware that his life is at risk. In about an hour he will lapse into unconsciousness and eventually die. His wife and two children have arrived at the hospital and they are all begging the doctor in charge of his treatment to save his life. They are obviously very distressed at the thought of possibly losing someone they all love. However, the doctor decides not to administer the blood transfusion even if this will lead to the man’s death. Write down what moral issues may arise from this scenario. Then write down what you believe should be done in this situation and why.</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>For a doctor, injury may be healed if given required attention.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>For a doctor, injury may be healed if given required attention. Having injuries mean that a human is harm and must be healed to prevent further or permanent damage. Injuries also differ in urgency. Some injuries require immediate attention but some injuries are less grave than the others. Injuries are caused by accidents or overworking, causing strain in muscles or even the eyes. Having injuries limit the capability of a person to work. Treating injuries require knowledge from trained people such as doctors, nurses, and first-aid personnel. Injuries happen unexpectedly so on our part, it is important to be careful in whatever we do.</p><p></p><p>Also see: https://brainly.ph/question/2273390</p><br />

                            26. Try these following jokes. Note and explain the fallacies being incurred
1. Always Cautious 
A car hits an old lady while she is crossing the street. She experiences only minor injuries. The driver protests, “It is not my fault. I’m a very cautious driver. I have been driving for six years.” “It’s not my fault either. I’m also a cautious person. And I have been walking for 60 years.”
2. Medical Skill 
Three surgeons are trying to impress each other with their achievements. First surgeon: “I operated on the arm of this guy and he has become a famous basketball player.” Second surgeon: “I operated on the leg of this guy and now he’s a world-famous marathon runner!” Third Surgeon: “That’s nothing. I fixed the smile on the face this idiot and now he’s a congressman!”
3. Strict Distinction 
A doctor asks his patient: “How many hours do you sleep every day?” “At most five hours.” “That is too few.” “It is enough. I sleep another 8 hours in the evening.
Duty-bound
Boss: “This is an extremely important position. We need a very responsible person.” Applicant: “Then I am the person you are looking for. In all the companies I worked for in the past, as soon as there is a problem, I was always responsible for it.”
4. So Strong 
Jack thinks that he is the strongest military man in the camp. Once he drank up to five bottles of whisky and started to bother the other customers. He orders another bottle of whiskey but the waiter hesitates to give it to him. “Listen. Give me one more bottle. Otherwise I will be angry. I may destroy this bar.” With that, he bangs his fist on the counter. Quickly right after he does this, a strong earthquake hits. When Jack wakes up on top of a heap of rubble he thinks it over and talks to himself with a smile: “By golly. I never knew I was so strong.”</h2><br />
