                                            STORY:Grandparent's Day In Filipino culture and tradition, grandparents and elders receive a high level of respect. Setting aside special honors for grandparents appears to be natural to us as it is in the rest of Asia. Thus, it perfectly natural that the nation should observe Grandparent's Day. Even from their early years, children learn the proper ways to show respect for their elders. For example, children quickly learn to ask for the blessing of Lolo and Lola upon arriving home from school. This is most evident in rural areas and among tribal communities, because two or three generations often share the same extended family home. Grandparents play an important role in handling cultural wisdom and values that form part of social glue that hold society together. Page 4 In urban areas today, grandparents form a vital part of the primary care giving network. They are the ones who watch over their grandchildren when both parents work and must leave home, especially so when one or both parents work abroad. Grandparents who are more affluent enjoy "spoiling" their grandchildren, giving gifts or preparing special food when they come to visit. As the nation celebrates Grandparent's Day today, it is an appropriate time for young Filipinos to ponder the dept that they owe their grandparents. No two families are alike, but everyone blessed with their grandparents should be able to recognize that he owes a great deal to them. Make today a special day for Grandma and Grandpa. Grandparent's Day is a good day for celebration the hands of love that nourish life. HAPPY CRANDPARENTS DAY QUESTION:Activity 2: Answer Me! Direction: Go back to the editorial sample.

Grandparent's Day In Filipino culture and tradition, grandparents and elders receive a high level of respect. Setting aside special honors for grandparents appears to be natural to us as it is in the rest of Asia. Thus, it I perfectly natural that the nation should observe Grandparent's Day. Even from their early years, children learn the proper ways to show respect for their elders. For example, children quickly learn to ask for the blessing of Lolo and Lola upon arriving home from school. This is most evident in rural areas and among tribal communities, because two or three generations often share the same extended family home. Grandparents play an important role in handling cultural wisdom and values that form part of social glue that hold society together. in urban areas today,grandparents form a vital part of the primary caregiving network.they are the ones who watch over their grandchildren when both parents work and must leave home,especially so when one or both parents work abroad.Grandparents who aremore affluent enjoy spoiling their grandchildren,giving gifts or preparing special food when they come to visit. As the nation celebrates grandparents day today it is an appropriate time for young filipinos to ponder the dept that they owe their grandparents.No two families are alike,but everyone blessed with their grandparents should be able to recognize that he owes a great deal to them. make today a special day for grandma and grandpa.grandparents day is a good day for celebration the hands of love that nourish life.write your answer on a sheet of paper.INTRODUCTIONBODYCONCLUSION​</a>

                                            Sample 2 With diminishing finances, it is rarely possible for a library of information center to have enough resources to fulfil the needs of its clients... Collaboration is widely recognized as the best way for libraries to cope with the ever increasing challenges: volume of information resources, nature and quality of information, user needs and expectations, information and communication technology competencies and infrastructure, inflated cost of information resources and staffing needs. However, although these challenges have continued to prevail, libraries working under collaborative initiatives like the Consortium of Academic and research Libraries in Illinois (CARL) have registered tremendous success. This research reports the findings of a thorough study to establish the factors that have led to the success of CARLI and how such success factors can be applied in libraries of developing countries like Uganda. Emphasis is placed on the establishment of CARLI leadership, the sharing of responsibility and decision making process, as well as sources of funding for the consortium... Also central to the research study is exploration of the role and responsibility of participating member libraries and their contributions to and expectations from the consortium. This present study has incorporated interviews with CARLI staff and a questionnaire survey to all the participating CARLI membership.

                            2. ﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿Ashley recently opened a store that sells only natural ingredients. She wants to advertise her products by distributing bags of samples in her neighborhood. It takes one person 2 minutes to prepare one bag.
How many hours will it take to prepare 900 bags of samples if Ashley and 5 of her friends do the work?</h2><br />
                        900 bags will take a total of 1800 minutes <br /><br />there are 6 people who would do the work (Ashley and her friends)<br /><br />1800÷6<br />=300 minutes (it means that Ashley and her friends will do the work for 300 minutes)<br /><br />However, as stated in the question the unit of measurement of the answer should be hours.<br /><br />300 minutes ÷ 60 minutes<br />=5 hours<br /><br /><br />So the final answer would be:<br /><br />It would take 5 hours for Ashley and her friends to do the work.<br />

                            7. STORY:Grandparent's Day In Filipino culture and tradition, grandparents and elders receive a high level of respect. Setting aside special honors for grandparents appears to be natural to us as it is in the rest of Asia. Thus, it perfectly natural that the nation should observe Grandparent's Day. Even from their early years, children learn the proper ways to show respect for their elders. For example, children quickly learn to ask for the blessing of Lolo and Lola upon arriving home from school. This is most evident in rural areas and among tribal communities, because two or three generations often share the same extended family home. Grandparents play an important role in handling cultural wisdom and values that form part of social glue that hold society together. Page 4 In urban areas today, grandparents form a vital part of the primary care giving network. They are the ones who watch over their grandchildren when both parents work and must leave home, especially so when one or both parents work abroad. Grandparents who are more affluent enjoy "spoiling" their grandchildren, giving gifts or preparing special food when they come to visit. As the nation celebrates Grandparent's Day today, it is an appropriate time for young Filipinos to ponder the dept that they owe their grandparents. No two families are alike, but everyone blessed with their grandparents should be able to recognize that he owes a great deal to them. Make today a special day for Grandma and Grandpa. Grandparent's Day is a good day for celebration the hands of love that nourish life. HAPPY CRANDPARENTS DAY QUESTION:Activity 2: Answer Me! Direction: Go back to the editorial sample.

Grandparent's Day In Filipino culture and tradition, grandparents and elders receive a high level of respect. Setting aside special honors for grandparents appears to be natural to us as it is in the rest of Asia. Thus, it I perfectly natural that the nation should observe Grandparent's Day. Even from their early years, children learn the proper ways to show respect for their elders. For example, children quickly learn to ask for the blessing of Lolo and Lola upon arriving home from school. This is most evident in rural areas and among tribal communities, because two or three generations often share the same extended family home. Grandparents play an important role in handling cultural wisdom and values that form part of social glue that hold society together. in urban areas today,grandparents form a vital part of the primary caregiving network.they are the ones who watch over their grandchildren when both parents work and must leave home,especially so when one or both parents work abroad.Grandparents who aremore affluent enjoy spoiling their grandchildren,giving gifts or preparing special food when they come to visit. As the nation celebrates grandparents day today it is an appropriate time for young filipinos to ponder the dept that they owe their grandparents.No two families are alike,but everyone blessed with their grandparents should be able to recognize that he owes a great deal to them. make today a special day for grandma and grandpa.grandparents day is a good day for celebration the hands of love that nourish life.write your answer on a sheet of paper.INTRODUCTIONBODYCONCLUSION​</h2><br />

                            16. Sample 2 With diminishing finances, it is rarely possible for a library of information center to have enough resources to fulfil the needs of its clients... Collaboration is widely recognized as the best way for libraries to cope with the ever increasing challenges: volume of information resources, nature and quality of information, user needs and expectations, information and communication technology competencies and infrastructure, inflated cost of information resources and staffing needs. However, although these challenges have continued to prevail, libraries working under collaborative initiatives like the Consortium of Academic and research Libraries in Illinois (CARL) have registered tremendous success. This research reports the findings of a thorough study to establish the factors that have led to the success of CARLI and how such success factors can be applied in libraries of developing countries like Uganda. Emphasis is placed on the establishment of CARLI leadership, the sharing of responsibility and decision making process, as well as sources of funding for the consortium... Also central to the research study is exploration of the role and responsibility of participating member libraries and their contributions to and expectations from the consortium. This present study has incorporated interviews with CARLI staff and a questionnaire survey to all the participating CARLI membership.
