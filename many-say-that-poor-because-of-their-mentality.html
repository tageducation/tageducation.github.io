 on the space provided after each paragraph. 1. “A dog is man’s best friend,” is a very common saying that contains some truth. Butdogs may not be the only animal whose companionship and friendship people enjoy. That is because there are many people who consider a cat their best friend. Personally, I think cats make excellent house pets as they are good companions. They are sweet and refined members of the household. They are soft and easy tocuddle since they are not heavy. ________________________________________2. We shouldn’t have homework on weekends. It takes away family time. You have todo your homework instead of playing with the family. You can’t go outside to play, soyou can get fat. We should also do it at school because we can’t ask the teacherquestions when we do it at home. It is hard to concentrate when you could be outsideplaying with friends. I hope you agree with me. ______________________________3. Most adults and children enjoy watching television. It is the most common pastime ofmany people. It does not cost much. It is appealing and within the reach of even thepoor people. In this manner, TV has become an important part of the mass mediaaround the world. Unfortunately, this resource is not used in a way that people couldget the best possible benefits from it. Hence, I would like to convince the readersthat they should not watch too much television. They must limit their time watching itbecause many TV programs do not have educational content. It makes peoplewaste time that could be used in more advantageous and profitable activities. Itnegatively affects people’s mental development. ______________________________________________4. In order to safely and efficiently operate a solid heating system, there are certainprecautions to consider. The chimney connectors and joints and the chimney fluemust be cleaned regularly. The wood supply must be kept at least five feet from thestove. _________________________________________ 5. Adolescence is often considered as one of the most challenging, the roughest, moststormy and most difficult phase of life for both children and their parents. During thisphase from childhood to adulthood, teenagers often look for the possibility of beingable to identify themselves as they start to search for their spot in this world. _________________________________________​</a>

                                            I'm a storyteller. And I would like to tell you a few personal stories about what I like to call "the danger of the single story." I grew up on a university campus in eastern Nigeria. My mother says that I started reading at the age of two, although I think four is probably close to the truth. So, I was an early reader. And what I read were British and American children's books. I was also an early writer. And when I began to write, at about the age of seven, stories in pencil with crayon illustrations that my poor mother was obligated to read, I wrote exactly the kinds of stories I was reading. All my characters were white and blue-eyed. They played in the snow. They ate apples. (Laughter) And they talked a lot about the weather, how lovely it was that the sun had come out. (Laughter) Now, this despite the fact that I lived in Nigeria. I had never been outside Nigeria. We didn't have snow. We ate mangoes. And we never talked about the weather because there was no need to. My characters also drank a lot of ginger beer because the characters in the British books I read drank ginger beer. Never mind that I had no idea what ginger beer was. (Laughter) And for many years afterwards, I would have a desperate desire to taste ginger beer. But that is another story. What this demonstrates, I think, is how impressionable and vulnerable we are in the face of a story, particularly as children. Because all I had read were books in which characters were foreign, I had become convinced that books, by their very nature, had to have foreigners in them, and had to be about things with which I could not personally identify. Now, things changed when I discovered African books. There weren't many of them available. And they weren't quite as easy to find as the foreign books. But because of writers like Chinua Achebe and Camara Laye I went through a mental shift in my perception of literature. I realized that people like me, girls with skin the color of chocolate, whose kinky hair could not form ponytails, could also exist in literature. I started to write about things I recognized. Now, I loved those American and British books I read. They stirred my imagination. They opened up new worlds for me. But the unintended consequence was that I did not know that people like me could exist in literature. So, what the discovery of African writers did for me was this: It saved me from having a single story of what books are Excerpt from TED Talk, The Danger of a Single Story, by Chimamanda Adichiewhat's the answer ​</a>

                        <p><strong>Somewhat</strong>, but it depends on the individual on how they live on their own. Since there is a <strong>mentality </strong>that gives a mindset to the people that will develop on them, believing that money is hard to get, it attracts fear to all that can lead to failure in terms of decision-making. There is struggle always in your mind on having this <strong>mentality</strong>.
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Poor individuals </strong>always depend on the actions taken by themselves. And they might make bad choices that lead them to have an outcome of an imperfect or poor life.
</p><p>These are called <strong>poverty traits</strong> in an individual; let us see some of the examples:
</p>Thinking money often and always worried about it
Wanting to be like rich people and starting to dislike them
Decision-making based on fear
People tend to believe only a tiny amount than making it wide
There is a feeling of guilt after you buy something
Too lazy to do something
A mindset of crab mentality
<p>
</p><p>If we have this mindset in our lives, we can get through it. Over time we need to learn in experience, education, or with the help of our family and friends. And these <strong>poverty traits</strong> might come from poverty in childhood life which causes a barrier to an individual. <strong>We need to listen and cut out these kinds of traits in ourselves.</strong>
</p><p>
</p><p>We can learn and change our mindset by having a circle of friends with different perspectives in life, reading books, watching movies and videos about it, and never losing hope. And stand up if you fail. Do not let your <strong>poor life </strong>drag and retain to yourself. Keep having a positive mindset in life that will make you get up from poverty.  </p><p></p><p>

 on the space provided after each paragraph. 1. “A dog is man’s best friend,” is a very common saying that contains some truth. Butdogs may not be the only animal whose companionship and friendship people enjoy. That is because there are many people who consider a cat their best friend. Personally, I think cats make excellent house pets as they are good companions. They are sweet and refined members of the household. They are soft and easy tocuddle since they are not heavy. ________________________________________2. We shouldn’t have homework on weekends. It takes away family time. You have todo your homework instead of playing with the family. You can’t go outside to play, soyou can get fat. We should also do it at school because we can’t ask the teacherquestions when we do it at home. It is hard to concentrate when you could be outsideplaying with friends. I hope you agree with me. ______________________________3. Most adults and children enjoy watching television. It is the most common pastime ofmany people. It does not cost much. It is appealing and within the reach of even thepoor people. In this manner, TV has become an important part of the mass mediaaround the world. Unfortunately, this resource is not used in a way that people couldget the best possible benefits from it. Hence, I would like to convince the readersthat they should not watch too much television. They must limit their time watching itbecause many TV programs do not have educational content. It makes peoplewaste time that could be used in more advantageous and profitable activities. Itnegatively affects people’s mental development. ______________________________________________4.

                            7. I'm a storyteller. And I would like to tell you a few personal stories about what I like to call "the danger of the single story." I grew up on a university campus in eastern Nigeria. My mother says that I started reading at the age of two, although I think four is probably close to the truth. So, I was an early reader. And what I read were British and American children's books. I was also an early writer. And when I began to write, at about the age of seven, stories in pencil with crayon illustrations that my poor mother was obligated to read, I wrote exactly the kinds of stories I was reading. All my characters were white and blue-eyed. They played in the snow. They ate apples. (Laughter) And they talked a lot about the weather, how lovely it was that the sun had come out. (Laughter) Now, this despite the fact that I lived in Nigeria. I had never been outside Nigeria. We didn't have snow. We ate mangoes. And we never talked about the weather because there was no need to. My characters also drank a lot of ginger beer because the characters in the British books I read drank ginger beer. Never mind that I had no idea what ginger beer was. (Laughter) And for many years afterwards, I would have a desperate desire to taste ginger beer. But that is another story. What this demonstrates, I think, is how impressionable and vulnerable we are in the face of a story, particularly as children. Because all I had read were books in which characters were foreign, I had become convinced that books, by their very nature, had to have foreigners in them, and had to be about things with which I could not personally identify. Now, things changed when I discovered African books. There weren't many of them available. And they weren't quite as easy to find as the foreign books. But because of writers like Chinua Achebe and Camara Laye I went through a mental shift in my perception of literature. I realized that people like me, girls with skin the color of chocolate, whose kinky hair could not form ponytails, could also exist in literature. I started to write about things I recognized. Now, I loved those American and British books I read. They stirred my imagination. They opened up new worlds for me. But the unintended consequence was that I did not know that people like me could exist in literature. So, what the discovery of African writers did for me was this: It saved me from having a single story of what books are Excerpt from TED Talk, The Danger of a Single Story, by Chimamanda Adichiewhat's the answer ​</h2><br />

                        1) Instead of demonstrating compassion, many individuals make fun of those with impairments.<p>It is vital that we educate those who make fun of persons with disabilities about why we should be <strong>understanding </strong>of them — namely, since they did not choose to have disabilities. As Martin Buber stated, it is essential that we embrace and respect them as fellow humans. Set a good example.</p><p></p>2) Regarding the rape problem, women are blamed for the clothing they wear.<p><strong>Women are not things. </strong>Women are human beings just like males. We should view women as human beings, and it is not their fault that others objectify them based on the clothing they wear.</p><p></p>3) Many assert that the attitude of the impoverished causes their poverty.<p>Poor individuals are poor not because of their attitude, but because some are not afforded the <strong>same opportunities/head start in life </strong>as others born into wealthy homes. As stated by Karol Wojtyla, it is essential that we are able to share ourselves with others. Put oneself in the shoes of others in order to comprehend their perspective.</p><p></p>4) Indigenous peoples have a culture that others can not comprehend, and some individuals make fun of them.<p>The fact that other people have different culture, beliefs, and traditions does not make them lesser to you; therefore, no one has the right to mock them. According to <strong>Confucius</strong>, we should create harmony and love in this world. Call out those who make fun of other people's culture and assist them in imagining what they would do if they were the target of such ridicule.</p><p></p>5) Some people today believe that psychological issues are merely excuses people use to justify their weaknesses.<p><strong>Psychological issues are equally as real as physical issues.</strong> Why would there be a need for psychiatrists if they are simply doctors? Consequently, the best solution is to educate people about psychological problems so that we have a better understanding of it and treat people with psychological problems as humans deserving of acceptance and sincerity.</p><p></p><p><strong>Learn more about morals here: https://brainly.ph/question/3542008</strong></p><p></p><p>#SPJ5</p><br />
