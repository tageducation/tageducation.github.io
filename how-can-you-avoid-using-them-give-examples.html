                                            of What is it Changes in materials can cause a good or a bad effect in the materials are good for the environment. Composting, Recycling, and the use of technology are some examples of the good effects of the changes in materials. Composting is a way decomposing plant or animal matter into fertilizer. Recycling helps lessen garbage by reusing them like plastic, styrofoam, old tires, and paper Evaporation and condensation are forms of physical change in mafter Evaporation is a crucial part of the water cycle. Water from all areas on Earth will not be recycled if it will not evaporate into water vapor as clouds in the sky.Condensation is important in transforming water vapor to droplets of water stored in clouds. Some changes in matter may result in negative effects like pollution destruction of habitat, and loss of lives. Improper disposal of garbage, harmful chemicals, and human waste can cause changes. It can pollute air, land, and water. Burning of garbage materials releases dangerous toxic chemicals, andgases that contribute to the intense greenhouse effect that may lead to global warming. Smoke from the burning of fuels can cause air pollution. Cutting down trees is also harmful to our environment. It affects the quality of air that we breathe It causes a rapid change in the temperature and in turn changes the weather patterns, which leads to other environmental concerns. Throwing into the river the detergents used for washing the clothes makes the river become polluted because these contain toxic substance. Polluted water kills living organisms like fish, and water plants. When land is dumped with garbage, the land becomes polluted, if this happens, the polluted land will serve as the breeding places for pests that carry germs, hence dangerous to human health W We have to do our share in maintaining a healthy environment. We must avoid too much use of electricity and gasoline. We must also avoid burning rubber tires and plastics Practices that will produce acid rain, increase global temperature, or deplete the ozone layer must be minimized. No matter how big orsmall the contribution you give, what matters most is you've made a difference for our environment.​</a>

                            8. of What is it Changes in materials can cause a good or a bad effect in the materials are good for the environment. Composting, Recycling, and the use of technology are some examples of the good effects of the changes in materials. Composting is a way decomposing plant or animal matter into fertilizer. Recycling helps lessen garbage by reusing them like plastic, styrofoam, old tires, and paper Evaporation and condensation are forms of physical change in mafter Evaporation is a crucial part of the water cycle. Water from all areas on Earth will not be recycled if it will not evaporate into water vapor as clouds in the sky.Condensation is important in transforming water vapor to droplets of water stored in clouds. Some changes in matter may result in negative effects like pollution destruction of habitat, and loss of lives. Improper disposal of garbage, harmful chemicals, and human waste can cause changes. It can pollute air, land, and water. Burning of garbage materials releases dangerous toxic chemicals, andgases that contribute to the intense greenhouse effect that may lead to global warming. Smoke from the burning of fuels can cause air pollution. Cutting down trees is also harmful to our environment. It affects the quality of air that we breathe It causes a rapid change in the temperature and in turn changes the weather patterns, which leads to other environmental concerns. Throwing into the river the detergents used for washing the clothes makes the river become polluted because these contain toxic substance. Polluted water kills living organisms like fish, and water plants. When land is dumped with garbage, the land becomes polluted, if this happens, the polluted land will serve as the breeding places for pests that carry germs, hence dangerous to human health W We have to do our share in maintaining a healthy environment. We must avoid too much use of electricity and gasoline. We must also avoid burning rubber tires and plastics Practices that will produce acid rain, increase global temperature, or deplete the ozone layer must be minimized. No matter how big orsmall the contribution you give, what matters most is you've made a difference for our environment.​</h2><br />
