Curiosity</p><p>Entrepreneurs are very attached to curiosity. Because it is that feeling that drives them to observe, research, and find out more about a phenomenon or problem. Usually, they will map the problem and look for opportunities for solutions. ot infrequently, if they can market a solution to the problem.Solutions are the key to the success of an entrepreneur.</p><p>2. Creative</p><p>Creativity has a fixed cost; anyone, including entrepreneurs, can have it. entrepreneurs, on average, have greater creativity and ability to create than the general popul4tion. They also work, relying on intelligence and imagination. However, practicing this creativity needs to be helped by hanging out often, listening, and, of course, reading books.</p><p>3. Discipline</p><p>At school, students are taught to always be disciplined. Even though it seems like a fairy tale or a hoax, it turns out that discipline is the key to living a life well. Discipline consists of self-management, money, and time. In addition, discipline is applied in setting priorities and determining concentration of mind. Discipline is also close to selecting the environment and association. So, discipline can lift the veil of your strengths and weaknesses.</p><p>4. Communicative</p><p>Entrepreneurs are able to express their thoughts in a unique and fun style. able to transl4te abstract and difficult things into easier l4nguage. Not only that, those who are communicative tend to be open-minded and willing to listen to input and ch4t from people who are different in environment, physicality, and life background.</p><p>5. Keep an Open Mind</p><p>Entrepreneurs must have an open mind. Because their life is full of twists and turns, they must be adaptive, flexible, and dynamic. It's okay to rel4x from the outside, but actually they're observing the environment.</p><p>6. Initiative</p><p>Entrepreneurs are self-starters.They are sometimes called initiators, so many are called social entrepreneur. Apart from that, the ability to take initiative can be owned by everyone if they have high social sensitivity.
