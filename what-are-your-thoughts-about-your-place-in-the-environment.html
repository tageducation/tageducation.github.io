Write your answer on a separate sheet of paper. UNDERSTANDING THE DISTANCE LEARNING DELIVERY MODALITIES Adopting to the challenges of the times in fulfilling its mandate, the DepEd would be using blended and distance learning programs during this period of COVID-19 pandemic consistent with the President's preference that children would not be sent to school until it is safe to do so. There are three kinds of DLDM, the Modular Distance Learning (MDL), the Blended Leaning (BL) , and Homeschooling. The MDL, which is for learners who do not have internet connectivity. The Printed or Digital Modules (PDM) are delivered to the homes of learners or picked up by their parents or guardians at designated places within coordinated schedules. Digital means modules (e-modules) are saved in USB/flash drives, CDs, OTGs. To be able to access the content of these materials, laptops, computers or tablets are needed. For the Online Distance Learning (ODL),this modality is applicable to learners as well as teachers with technology devices in which internet connectivity is required. The second DLDM is the Blended Leaning (BL) which is a combination of ODL, MDL, and R/TVI. The learners make use of computers, tablets, smart phones, CD/DVD, USB storage, TV, /Radio and Printed Modules in learning. Through this modality learners are not required to report to school, physical distancing is observed and the number of people going out from their homes is minimized. The third DLDM is Homeschooling, It is the alternative learning modality learners that provides learners with access to formal education while staying in a home-based environment with a parent, guardian or tutors as authorized learning facilitators instead of classroom teachers.

Footnote to Youth Jose Garcia VillaIn this story, we come across such a young pair of Dodong and Teang. They are completely enamoured with each other and want to tie the wedding knot even though they are still teenagers. Dodong is adamant in his pursuit of Teang who happens to have another suitor, Lucio. He is much older and well settled in his life. But Teang follows her heart and chooses Dodong. Dodong has a hard time convincing his father about his decision to marry. He wants his son to weigh all the pros and cons and then make an informed decision. However, Dodong is not to be moved from his resolution. In the end, they both get married and begin a hopeful journey together. The next year Teang gives birth to their first child. This reality hits them hard. They are teen parents and realize the enormity of their responsibility. Taking care of children and building a family is a serious thing. In the next seven years, their family grows to a total of nine with seven kids. Teang now regrets her decision especially looking at Lucio who is still childless (after marrying another girl). She wonders if she would have the same fate if she had picked Lucio. But she dismisses such fleeting thought. Both of them are still devoted to each other and their large family. After some years, fate reverses time and now their firstborn, Blas comes to them with the same desire. He, still a teenager wants to marry the girl of his dreams, Tena.Dodong realizes how history is repeating itself and warns Blas about the consequences of such a massive decision. However, like father like son, he ends up following the same route and marries his sweetheart at 17 years of age.1.	Why do you think the author chose the rural community for the setting?A.

Write your answer on a separate sheet of paper. UNDERSTANDING THE DISTANCE LEARNING DELIVERY MODALITIES Adopting to the challenges of the times in fulfilling its mandate, the DepEd would be using blended and distance learning programs during this period of COVID-19 pandemic consistent with the President's preference that children would not be sent to school until it is safe to do so. There are three kinds of DLDM, the Modular Distance Learning (MDL), the Blended Leaning (BL) , and Homeschooling. The MDL, which is for learners who do not have internet connectivity. The Printed or Digital Modules (PDM) are delivered to the homes of learners or picked up by their parents or guardians at designated places within coordinated schedules. Digital means modules (e-modules) are saved in USB/flash drives, CDs, OTGs. To be able to access the content of these materials, laptops, computers or tablets are needed. For the Online Distance Learning (ODL),this modality is applicable to learners as well as teachers with technology devices in which internet connectivity is required. The second DLDM is the Blended Leaning (BL) which is a combination of ODL, MDL, and R/TVI. The learners make use of computers, tablets, smart phones, CD/DVD, USB storage, TV, /Radio and Printed Modules in learning. Through this modality learners are not required to report to school, physical distancing is observed and the number of people going out from their homes is minimized. The third DLDM is Homeschooling, It is the alternative learning modality learners that provides learners with access to formal education while staying in a home-based environment with a parent, guardian or tutors as authorized learning facilitators instead of classroom teachers.

Footnote to Youth Jose Garcia VillaIn this story, we come across such a young pair of Dodong and Teang. They are completely enamoured with each other and want to tie the wedding knot even though they are still teenagers. Dodong is adamant in his pursuit of Teang who happens to have another suitor, Lucio. He is much older and well settled in his life. But Teang follows her heart and chooses Dodong. Dodong has a hard time convincing his father about his decision to marry. He wants his son to weigh all the pros and cons and then make an informed decision. However, Dodong is not to be moved from his resolution. In the end, they both get married and begin a hopeful journey together. The next year Teang gives birth to their first child. This reality hits them hard. They are teen parents and realize the enormity of their responsibility. Taking care of children and building a family is a serious thing. In the next seven years, their family grows to a total of nine with seven kids. Teang now regrets her decision especially looking at Lucio who is still childless (after marrying another girl). She wonders if she would have the same fate if she had picked Lucio. But she dismisses such fleeting thought. Both of them are still devoted to each other and their large family. After some years, fate reverses time and now their firstborn, Blas comes to them with the same desire. He, still a teenager wants to marry the girl of his dreams, Tena.Dodong realizes how history is repeating itself and warns Blas about the consequences of such a massive decision. However, like father like son, he ends up following the same route and marries his sweetheart at 17 years of age.1.	Why do you think the author chose the rural community for the setting?A.
