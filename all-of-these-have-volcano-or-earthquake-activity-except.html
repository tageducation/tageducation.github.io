                        <strong>Volcano or Earthquake Activity</strong><p></p><p><strong>Earthquakes</strong> are vibrations that occur on the earth's surface due to the sudden release of <strong>energy from within due to the movement of the earth's plates</strong> so that seismic waves are created. The frequency of a region refers to the type and size of earthquakes experienced over a period of time. Earthquakes are measured using a seismometer.</p><p></p><p><strong>Volcanic earthquakes </strong>are earthquakes caused by the movement of <strong>magma inside an active volcano.</strong> If the magma activity gets higher it will cause an explosion that will cause an earthquake or usually occurs before a volcano erupts. The earthquake was only felt around the volcano.</p><p> </p><p>Countries that are <strong>prone to earthquakes</strong>, either volcanic earthquakes or tectonic earthquakes, are <strong>Japan, Indonesia, the Philippines, Mexico, New Zealand, Alaska, and Guatemala.</strong> These countries are Ring of Fire areas that have the potential for earthquakes, tsunamis, and volcanic activity.</p><p><strong>- Australia</strong> is a country that <strong>is not well known for earthquakes</strong> but has experienced earthquakes. This is because Australia is on a very stable continental landmass, geologically Australia is in the middle of a tectonic plate (Australian Plate) with no major active faults, so it has far fewer earthquakes than areas near plate boundaries or major fault lines.</p><p><strong>- Japan </strong>is a country covered by the Ring of Fire. Earthquakes are frequent in this country. To overcome this, the Japanese government built earthquake-resistant or anti-earthquake buildings.</p><p>Not only is Japan located in the <strong>Ring of Fire area</strong>, but Japan is also the <strong>meeting place for four world plates</strong>, namely the Pacific, Eurasian, North American, and Philippine Plates. The movement and subduction of the Philippine and Pacific plates under one or two other plates will cause earthquakes.</p><p><strong>- The Philippines </strong>is a country located on the edge of the Pacific plate and surrounded by a seismic hot zone. In the Philippines, a high-magnitude earthquake has caused a deadly volcanic eruption. The last earthquake that shook the Philippines was on July 27, 2022.</p><p><strong>- Mexico</strong> is an earthquake-prone country that has faced several high-magnitude earthquakes in the past. This is because Mexico is located in <strong>one of the most seismically active areas </strong>on the earth's surface. Mexico is located on three seismic plates namely, the Cocos plate, the Pacific plate, and the North American plate. Due to the movement of tectonic plates, volcanic eruptions are also a threat to the country.</p><p></p><p>Based on the description above,<strong> the correct answer to this question is A. Australia.</strong></p><p>This is because Australia is a country that has a very stable continental landmass, geologically Australia is in the middle of a tectonic plate (Australian Plate) without any large active faults.</p><p></p><p>learn more about earthquakes https://brainly.ph/question/15270299</p><p>#SPJ2</p><br />
