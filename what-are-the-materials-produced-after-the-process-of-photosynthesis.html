                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>These sugar molecules are the basis for more complex molecules made by the photosynthetic cell, such as glucose.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>After the process is complete, photosynthesis releases oxygen and produces carbohydrate molecules, most commonly glucose.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>These sugar molecules are the basis for more complex molecules made by the photosynthetic cell, such as glucose. Then, via respiration processes, cells use oxygen and glucose to synthesize energy-rich carrier molecules, such as ATP, and carbon dioxide is produced as a waste product. <p>#Brainly </p><p>#CarryOnLearning </p><br />
