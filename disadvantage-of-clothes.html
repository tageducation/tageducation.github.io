                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The disadvantages are that some people go too far with not wearing enough clothes, while others go to the other extreme of wearing too much.I don't understand why some religions are so strict with clothing. A persons heart is where sin is. You can look very holy on the outside, but you can still be having bad thoughts of lust,jealousy,rudeness,anger, all of these are inward sins unless you act out, and then they become evil. </p><p></p><p></p><p>Answer:boutique stores serve a specific clientele.the advantages amd disanvantages of boutique clothing and shoe stores lie in the nature.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Takes time to wash and dry the pads compared to throwing away disposables.</strong></p><p><strong>Handwashing can be time consuming and difficult (though you can machine wash them).</strong></p><p><strong>More expensive to purchase initially.</strong></p><p><strong>Usually bulkier than many “ultrathin” style disposable pads.</strong></p><p><strong>Not as easily available (not stocked in supermarkets).</strong></p><p></p><p>Cloth Pads can be Hard to MaintainCloth pads are best when hand washed first, but they need to be machine washed for extra safety. Once washed and dried, cloth pads must be stored safely. This might be time-consuming for many, but it eventually fits right into a routine.</p><p></p><p>#carryonlearning </p><p>Your Welcome! </p><p>Btw u can just search in google so you won’t have to waste your points^^</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Advantages</p><p>Time</p><p></p><p>This is an advantage you must not ignore, especially if you are a busy person. Compared to hand-washing, it saves a large amount of time, and you can also engage in a different task without any supervision. It works a lot faster than hand-washing and adds as many cycles as you want, not worrying about that mysterious new pile of dirty laundry!</p><p></p><p>Effort</p><p>It is a well-known fact that hand-washing requires much more effort than washing them with a washing machine, especially if there are stubborn spots that need vigorous scrubbing. Washing machines need the ‘massive’ effort of just putting laundry, adding detergent, and pushing a button! Even adamant spots and stains are easier to remove using various options to operate your washing machine. Why fear when there is an agitator?</p><p></p><p>Size</p><p>There are a variety of sizes in which a typical washing machine can be availed. It goes on from portable forms to large ones that hook to the water line in the laundry room (or basement). The smaller ones that can hook to the sink can be used in apartments. Apart from the place you live in, the number of family members and the number of large garments (comforters and bedsheets) can also decide the size of the washing machine.</p><p></p><p>Cycles</p><p>Different kinds of cycles can be opted in a washing machine according to different materials.
