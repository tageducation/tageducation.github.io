COMMUNICABLE DISEASE
Are we there yet?
 We had been through a global crisis wherein a pandemic brought by COVID-19 shaken the whole world. It almost stole 2 years in our history that the world seems to stop from its original routine. Almost three years had passed, gradually we are start living back to the usual way we used to be. But the real question is, do we totally recover from the doom of the pandemic? Are we now really free from the its course? Can we return to the normal living we had before? Are we there yet?
 December 2019, when a new strain of Corona Virus started to plagued a city in China. Everyone was not aware about the seriousness this virus can bring. Not until it started spreading in the whole world. From city to city to country to country, COVID-19 spread quickly and killed millions of lives in the whole world. It took almost 2 years to create a vaccine against this virus that lessen the symptoms and fatality brought by this disease. And now, the world is starting to stand again. To rise up from the agony and chaos brought by this killer disease. 
 But another question arises, are we ready to face this again? Are we ready when time comes that another communicable virus tends to haunt our lives again?
 As we can see, it is easy to prevent this disease if people know how to discipline themselves. If we follow strict protocol. These measures are implemented to help stop the spread of virus, but people think the other way. The use of face mask has been an effective way ton preventing the spread of virus. It has been more effective when social distancing has been implemented. Strengthening our immune system will also help in fighting viruses through taking vitamins, regular exercise, and having a healthy and balance diet. These are small steps but can create a big impact in fighting communicable disease.
 Now, to answer the question if we are ready to face another scenario like this, we can say that it is a YES! Yes, if we know how to discipline ourselves. Yes, if know to follow protocols. Yes, if we know how to help ourselves and maintain ourselves in good health. Communicable disease is easy to spread, but it is also easy to fight.

                                            DALIS on yourginningints)A Day in my Lifewritten by Sean AAteneo de Manila Junior High School, Philippinesectonaiessingns.quences andsis. ThecanenceghtfulofanPhilippines is in a state of turmoil. We are combating a virus(COVID-19) with no foreseeable solution that is too great to bear. We arein great fear, which causes us to stop and question what God has clearlytold us to do. We don't know what lies ahead of us, so we becomeapprehensive. Our imagination can magnify problems until they seeminsuperable.Life under quarantine lockdown is giving so much suffering toFilipinos. There are scarcities of food, relief goods and protective gearsPeople are into panic-buying, hoarding, and overpricing their goods. Also,there are losses in business and employment that has greatly affectedthe economy of the country. Sadly, our government can't handle COVID-19 cases beyond its capacity because of the surging number of infectedpatients, death, and shortage of isolation rooms. Obviously, we're allcaught in surprise and we're not prepared for this situation.At home, we've managed to survive our day by being productive.We do the household chores and prepare stuff for charities which serveas a bonding moment for our family. It is also a time to reconnect with ourSavior in preparing for Lent. It nourishes our spirit whenever we watchmass and pray the novena. Thus, I immense myself daily in the Word ofGod because if I don't guard my heart, I will grow cold in my love forChrist. In moments like these, I learned to count my blessings. To countwhat we've left. Counting our blessings gives us comfort and strength intimes of crisis. It cushions our sufferings from any kind of loss or failureRealizing that we still have a lot of things to look forward to and enjoy cangive us a sense of hope. There is no reason to live in fear when we havethe mighty presence of the Holy Spirit within us. God didn't promise atrouble-free world.He allows us to suffer difficulties for a purpose.Heallows people to hunger so they could experience His provisions anddevelop a deeper level of trust within Him.Filipinos must learn that in these times of distress, when ourdevotion and obedience are put to the greatest test, we must focus onGod, not on the problem. For we can do all things through Him who givesus strength, learn to be patient, do it in God's way. Never let thefaithlessness of others determine what we should do, for our Lord knowsour every need and He will not replenish us in the same way Hisresponse to us will always perfectly correspond to our present need. Wemust foster good in our community and expand the horizon of ourgenerosity, preferably for those in situation of dire need. Furthermore, I'mhoping that we will all be a ray of hope to each other in the midst ofdespair. We can't recover on our own, only Him knows how to heal andareic.alrejuvenate a soul​</a>

                            6. Based on the biblical passage, how do we know that a person has already gained true free-dom?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>2 Cor 3:17</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong>2 Cor 3:17 "And the Lord is the Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom"</strong></p><p>This verse states that the Lord is the Spirit. Then in chapter 4 verse 5 <strong>"... Christ Jesus as Lord..." </strong>This is a strong word in the Bible telling us that Christ is the Spirit. Only the Spirit who gives us the divine life as seen <strong>" the Spirit gives life" (3:6) . </strong>When the person receive the Spirit he gains freedom.</p><p>Also in <strong>John 8:32 " the truth shall set you free ". </strong> The <strong>"truth"</strong> in the original language which is Greek this is the same of the word <strong>"reality" in John 1:14,17</strong></p><p><strong>John 1:14 " ... full of grace and reality", </strong>verse 17<strong> " ...grace came through Jesus Christ"</strong></p><p>By this verse the truth is not the doctrine but the Lord Himself. In John 8:32 <strong>" the truth shall set you free " </strong>but as you read further in verse 36 <strong>" ... the Son sets you free ..." </strong></p><p>This is another proof that the Lord is the truth. </p><p>In Col 2:9 <strong>" For in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily" . </strong></p><p>Since the Lord is the truth, the reality then He is the reality of what God is because what was in the Lord is the fullness of the Godhead. When the Lord comes into a person, the reality is imparted into us and is realized by us. And this reality operates to free us from the bondage of sin. Thus a person gains true freedom when the Lord comes as the Spirit into that person and receive Him. </p><p><strong></strong></p><br />

COMMUNICABLE DISEASE
Are we there yet?
 We had been through a global crisis wherein a pandemic brought by COVID-19 shaken the whole world. It almost stole 2 years in our history that the world seems to stop from its original routine. Almost three years had passed, gradually we are start living back to the usual way we used to be. But the real question is, do we totally recover from the doom of the pandemic? Are we now really free from the its course? Can we return to the normal living we had before? Are we there yet?
 December 2019, when a new strain of Corona Virus started to plagued a city in China. Everyone was not aware about the seriousness this virus can bring. Not until it started spreading in the whole world. From city to city to country to country, COVID-19 spread quickly and killed millions of lives in the whole world. It took almost 2 years to create a vaccine against this virus that lessen the symptoms and fatality brought by this disease. And now, the world is starting to stand again. To rise up from the agony and chaos brought by this killer disease. 
 But another question arises, are we ready to face this again? Are we ready when time comes that another communicable virus tends to haunt our lives again?
 As we can see, it is easy to prevent this disease if people know how to discipline themselves. If we follow strict protocol. These measures are implemented to help stop the spread of virus, but people think the other way. The use of face mask has been an effective way ton preventing the spread of virus. It has been more effective when social distancing has been implemented. Strengthening our immune system will also help in fighting viruses through taking vitamins, regular exercise, and having a healthy and balance diet. These are small steps but can create a big impact in fighting communicable disease.
 Now, to answer the question if we are ready to face another scenario like this, we can say that it is a YES! Yes, if we know how to discipline ourselves. Yes, if know to follow protocols. Yes, if we know how to help ourselves and maintain ourselves in good health. Communicable disease is easy to spread, but it is also easy to fight. If we can work together, fight as one together, we can heal this world together!</h2><br />
                        <p>My opinion on the article is that it is a wake-up call for everyone to take communicable diseases seriously and to prepare for the possibility of future outbreaks. The COVID-19 pandemic has taught us the importance of discipline, following protocols, and taking care of our health to prevent the spread of the disease. It is essential to remember that prevention is better than cure, and small steps such as wearing a mask, social distancing, and boosting our immune system can make a big difference.</p><p></p><br />

                            20. DALIS on yourginningints)A Day in my Lifewritten by Sean AAteneo de Manila Junior High School, Philippinesectonaiessingns.quences andsis. ThecanenceghtfulofanPhilippines is in a state of turmoil. We are combating a virus(COVID-19) with no foreseeable solution that is too great to bear. We arein great fear, which causes us to stop and question what God has clearlytold us to do. We don't know what lies ahead of us, so we becomeapprehensive. Our imagination can magnify problems until they seeminsuperable.Life under quarantine lockdown is giving so much suffering toFilipinos. There are scarcities of food, relief goods and protective gearsPeople are into panic-buying, hoarding, and overpricing their goods. Also,there are losses in business and employment that has greatly affectedthe economy of the country. Sadly, our government can't handle COVID-19 cases beyond its capacity because of the surging number of infectedpatients, death, and shortage of isolation rooms. Obviously, we're allcaught in surprise and we're not prepared for this situation.At home, we've managed to survive our day by being productive.We do the household chores and prepare stuff for charities which serveas a bonding moment for our family. It is also a time to reconnect with ourSavior in preparing for Lent. It nourishes our spirit whenever we watchmass and pray the novena. Thus, I immense myself daily in the Word ofGod because if I don't guard my heart, I will grow cold in my love forChrist. In moments like these, I learned to count my blessings. To countwhat we've left. Counting our blessings gives us comfort and strength intimes of crisis. It cushions our sufferings from any kind of loss or failureRealizing that we still have a lot of things to look forward to and enjoy cangive us a sense of hope. There is no reason to live in fear when we havethe mighty presence of the Holy Spirit within us. God didn't promise atrouble-free world.He allows us to suffer difficulties for a purpose.Heallows people to hunger so they could experience His provisions anddevelop a deeper level of trust within Him.Filipinos must learn that in these times of distress, when ourdevotion and obedience are put to the greatest test, we must focus onGod, not on the problem. For we can do all things through Him who givesus strength, learn to be patient, do it in God's way. Never let thefaithlessness of others determine what we should do, for our Lord knowsour every need and He will not replenish us in the same way Hisresponse to us will always perfectly correspond to our present need. Wemust foster good in our community and expand the horizon of ourgenerosity, preferably for those in situation of dire need. Furthermore, I'mhoping that we will all be a ray of hope to each other in the midst ofdespair. We can't recover on our own, only Him knows how to heal andareic.alrejuvenate a soul​</h2><br />
