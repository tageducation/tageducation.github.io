(Velocity, Kinetic, Force) is a push or pull upon an object resulting from theobject's interaction with another object.3. When the force of friction always slows down or stops the motion of an objectin the (same, opposite, equal) direction,4. It is a kind of friction when solid surfaces slide over each other is called (sliding,rolling, static).5. When you push the ball on the smooth surface the less friction it is and theball moves (slower, moderate, faster).6. (Sliding, Static, Rolling) when a force is applied to an object but it does notcause it to move.7. When you push the ball on a rough surface the high fiction it is and the ballmoves (slower, moderate, faster) then suddenly stops.8. (Force, Faster, Friction) is a force that occurs when one object rubs againstanother object.9.
