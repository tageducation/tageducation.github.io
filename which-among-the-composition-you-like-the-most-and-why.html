                                            1. Which of the following terms is used to describe once magma reaches the surface already?
a. silica
b. lava
C. rock d. All of the above
2. Where does the Hot spots usually occur?
a only at plate boundaries
c. only under the middle of plates
b. far from plate boundaries.
d. only on top the middle of plates.
3. How is a magma can cause explosive eruption?
a. low in viscosity
c. high water content/concentration
D high in silica
d. high in viscosity
4.) It describes a kind of volcano that is no longer erupting but is likely to erupt again in the future.
a. extinct b. dormant
c. active. d. All of the above
5.) What forms when magma hardens in the pipe of a volcano?
a sill
b. dike C. volcanic neck d. volcanic ash
6.) When a volcano erupts quietly, what kind of mountain forms?
a shield volcano b. cinder cone c. composite volcano d. All of the above
7.) What forms when hot water and steam are trapped underground in a narrow crack?
a hot spring b. geyser c. batholith d. All of the above
8.) Which type of volcanoes have broad bases and steep sides, usually have a large crater at the top and are formed by
alternating layers of magma and ash?
A. Cinder cones B. Shield volcanoes C. Composite volcanoes D. Calderas
9.) Why are super-volcanoes considered as the most dangerous type of volcano?
1. The eruption significantly increases the global temperature
II. During an eruption, enormous amounts of ash are thrown into the atmosphere and encircles the globe.
III. The ash from an eruption lowers the temperature of the entire planet.
IV. The lava that flows during an eruption causes damage to property
a. I and II only b. II and Ill only c. II and IV only
d. I, II and Ill only
10. Which best describe a donant volcano?
a. a volcano that is presently not erupting and that is unlikely to do so for a very long time in the future
b. it is currently erupting or shows signs of unrest activities
C. not presently erupting but has erupted in the past and is likely to erupt again in the future
d. also called sleeping volcano because it is presently inactive but could erupt again
11.) Julie watched an old news video of the last explosive eruption of Mount Pinatubo. She lives in Tagaytay and thought
that Taal Volcano in the past did not erupt the way Mt. Pinatubo did because it's located within a lake while the other is
directly situated on land. Thus, she inferred that volcanoes erupt differently because of their composition and location.
Which among the following is not a basic feature shared by all volcanoes if you were to explain this to Julie?
a. The magma collects in magma chambers that can be 160 kilometers beneath the surface.
b. As the rock heats, it expands, which creates even more pressure causing the magma to seek a way
out pushing toward the surface.
c. Eruption of the magma on the surface is always violent and explosive due to the extreme heat
and pressure
d. When magma reaches the surface, it comes out and is called an eruption
12.1 In the recent past, humans have been looking for and trying out alternative sources of renewable energy to reduce
dependence on fossil fuels. How can the energy from volcanoes be tapped for human use?
a. The lava can be used for cooking,
b. The energy from the magma can be used to heat water.
c. Geothermal energy can be tapped to produce steam used for heating showers.
d. Geothermal energy can be used to generate electricity
13.) Your father just got a promotion and his already high salary was even doubled but your family had to move to Camiguin
Island several kilometers away from Mount Hibok-Hibok which is an active volcano. Having known that you live near an
active volcano, what information should you know and preparations should you take in case the volcano will show signs of
an eruption?
a. Check out the website of PHIVOLCS and read on the past eruption history of Mi. Hibok-Hibok from your local library</a>

Romantic music was often ostensibly inspired by (or else sought to evoke) non-musical stimuli, such as nature, literature, poetry, super-natural elements or the fine arts.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Positive impacts of globalisation
</p><p>Globalisation is having a dramatic effect - for good or bad - on world economies and on people's lives.
</p><p>
</p><p>Some of the positive impacts are:
</p><p>
</p><p>Inward investment by TNCs helps countries by providing new jobs and skills for local people.
</p><p>TNCs bring wealth and foreign currency to local economies when they buy local resources, products and services. The extra money created by this investment can be spent on education, health and infrastructure.
</p><p>The sharing of ideas, experiences and lifestyles of people and cultures. People can experience foods and other products not previously available in their countries.
</p><p>Globalisation increases awareness of events in faraway parts of the world. For example, the UK was quickly made aware of the 2004 tsunami and sent help rapidly in response.
</p><p>Globalisation may help to make people more aware of global issues such as deforestation and global warming and alert them to the need for sustainable development.</p><p></p><br />
