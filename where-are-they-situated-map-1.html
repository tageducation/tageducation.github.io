                                            Activity 1. Re-circle the Ring / Plate movements may result in earthquakes. Earthquakes may happen anytime, either on land or underwater. Earthquakes on land can be caused either by tectonic plates movement or volcanic eruptions. Earthquakes under the sea can cause a tsunami. Our country, the Philippines, is situated in a place where Plate Tectonics is very evident- the Ring of Fire. It is a long chain of volcanoes and other tectonically active structures that surround the Pacific Ocean. The Ring of Fire is one of the most geologically active areas on Earth and a site for frequent earthquakes and powerful volcanic eruptions.

                            10. Activity 1. Re-circle the Ring / Plate movements may result in earthquakes. Earthquakes may happen anytime, either on land or underwater. Earthquakes on land can be caused either by tectonic plates movement or volcanic eruptions. Earthquakes under the sea can cause a tsunami. Our country, the Philippines, is situated in a place where Plate Tectonics is very evident- the Ring of Fire. It is a long chain of volcanoes and other tectonically active structures that surround the Pacific Ocean. The Ring of Fire is one of the most geologically active areas on Earth and a site for frequent earthquakes and powerful volcanic eruptions.
