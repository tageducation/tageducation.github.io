                        <p><strong></strong></p>Rice Terraces of the Philippine Cordilleras were inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1995
<p>        <strong>The high rice fields of the Ifugao have followed the contours of the mountains for 2,000 years.</strong> They have contributed to the development of a landscape of great beauty that reflects the peace between humanity and the world. They are the fruit of wisdom passed down from generation to generation, <strong>as well as the manifestation of sacred values and a delicate social balance.</strong>
</p><p>       <strong>  The Rice Terraces of the Philippine Cordilleras are an excellent example of a living cultural landscape that dates back two centuries in the pre-colonial Philippines.</strong> The terraces are located in the Philippine Cordillera mountain range on the northern island of Luzon in the Philippine archipelago. Although the historic terraces cover a large area, the inscribed property is made up of five clusters of the most well-preserved and spectacular terraces spread over four municipalities. They're all descendants of the Ifugao ethnic group, a small ethnic group who have lived in these mountains for thousands of years.
</p><p>          <strong> The Ifugao Rice Terraces are a perfect example of how the physical, sociocultural, economic, religious, and political environments are all intertwined.</strong> It is, without a doubt, a living cultural ecosystem of unrivaled beauty. The Ifugao Rice Terraces are a precious gift to humanity from Philippine forefathers. The Ifugao Rice Terraces, which were developed 2000 years ago and passed down from generation to generation, are a lasting example of an ancient civilization that conquered numerous challenges and setbacks faced by modernization.
</p><p>           The terraces reflect cultural traditions'<strong> longevity as well as incredible consistency and resilience, as archaeological evidence shows that this technique has been used in the area for over 2000 years and has remained virtually unchanged.</strong> They have a lot of lessons that can be used in other similar circumstances.</p><p></p><p>Pls. see the  information link </p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/4062526</p><p>#LetsStudy</p><p></p><p>
