                        Research <p>Research needs to be done to <strong>gain knowledge or new discoveries</strong>. As proof or testing of the truth of existing knowledge. As the development of knowledge of an existing scientific field.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>In general, research can be divided into two, namely basic research and applied research. Basic research is research that has intellectual reasons aimed at the development of science, namely a reason based on the desire to know solely that which does not directly have practical uses, for example investigations of outer space, investigations of the moon and so on. Meanwhile, <strong>applied research is research that has the goal of being able </strong>to do something much better, more effectively and efficiently. For example, research on the cost of living, the results of which can be directly used as a basis for determining wages/salaries. Meanwhile the results of research on juvenile delinquency can be applied to overcome this delinquency. the purpose of research is to inform.</p><p>There are at least <strong>four reasons behind why the research</strong> needs to be carried out:</p>Awareness of limited knowledge, understanding, and ability.Fulfillment of curiosity.Troubleshooting.Fulfillment of self-development. <p>This research was carried out because it was driven by the fulfillment of the need for curiosity. Humans have an urge or instinct to want to know about something outside of themselves. Knowledge and understanding of something, give rise to new curiosity that is wider, higher, more comprehensive.<strong> The urge to know is channeled to increase and improve </strong>knowledge and understanding. For example, humans always ask, what is it, how is it, why is it, and so on. For most people, cursory and simple answers may be satisfying, but for certain people, scientists, researchers, and perhaps leaders too, answers are needed that are deeper, more detailed and more comprehensive.</p><p> </p><p></p><p>More on research objectives</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/19112828</p><p>#SPJ5</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Since the early years of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic, stigma has been understood to be a major barrier to successful HIV prevention, care, and treatment. This article highlights findings from more than 10 studies in Asia, Africa, and Latin America—conducted from 1997 through 2007 as part of the Horizons program—that have contributed to clarifying the relationship between stigma and HIV, determining how best to measure stigma among varied populations, and designing and evaluating the impact of stigma reduction-focused program strategies. Studies showed significant associations between HIV-related stigma and less use of voluntary counseling and testing, less willingness to disclose test results, and incorrect knowledge about transmission. Programmatic lessons learned included how to assist institutions with recognizing stigma, the importance of confronting both fears of contagion and negative social judgments, and how best to engage people living with HIV in programs. The portfolio of work reveals the potential and importance of directly addressing stigma reduction in HIV programs.</p><br />

I've grown an interests about this topic since I myself is a student who questions this system, unorganized works that lead confusion and the downfall of my grades. Tremendous amount of work and lack of evaluation are almost equal in quantity, this balance in threat and gratification has caused multiple classes of reported suicide among students, many have fallen to depression and severe anxiety, numerous students grades dropped because of stress and procrastination due to lack of supervision. Online distance learning has allot of flaws that tackle with procrastination, fear of failure, deadlines, stress, lack of attention from parents lack of communication from teachers and lack of motivation. I want to study this matter since I want to spread awareness and I want to amplify the opinions of the voices of many students alongside me.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>#CarryOnLearning</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Hope this Helps , paki brainliest lang po</strong></p><br />
