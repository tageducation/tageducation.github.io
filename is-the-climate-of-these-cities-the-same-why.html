                                            ACTIVITY 2: Identify as to which factor affecting climate the following statement explains.
1. The side of a mountain near water (WINDWARD SIDE) gets more rainfall, and the side away (LEEWARD) is
drier.
2. Wind patterns move heat and moisture around Earth, which can change the temperature and rainfall in a
place.
3. In Kilimanjaro, the climate gets colder the higher up you go, so at the top, it could be snowing, while at the
bottom, it is hot because of the sun’s direct rays at the equator.
4. It refers to features of the land, like mountains and hills, and valleys and low points.
5. Warm air thus moves out from land to sea, slowing down the rise of air temperature above land.
6. When an area is farther from the equator, the air temperature is lower. If it is closer to the equator, the
temperature is higher.
7. This tends to increase the temperatures of eastern coastal areas and decrease the temperatures of western
coastal areas.
8. Features like mountains cause some places to get more rainfall, and some areas to be drier.
9. Elevation refers to how high above sea level a location is.
ASSESSMENT: Write the letter of the correct answer.

                            10. ACTIVITY 2: Identify as to which factor affecting climate the following statement explains.
1. The side of a mountain near water (WINDWARD SIDE) gets more rainfall, and the side away (LEEWARD) is
drier.
2. Wind patterns move heat and moisture around Earth, which can change the temperature and rainfall in a
place.
3. In Kilimanjaro, the climate gets colder the higher up you go, so at the top, it could be snowing, while at the
bottom, it is hot because of the sun’s direct rays at the equator.
4. It refers to features of the land, like mountains and hills, and valleys and low points.
5. Warm air thus moves out from land to sea, slowing down the rise of air temperature above land.
6. When an area is farther from the equator, the air temperature is lower. If it is closer to the equator, the
temperature is higher.
7. This tends to increase the temperatures of eastern coastal areas and decrease the temperatures of western
coastal areas.
8. Features like mountains cause some places to get more rainfall, and some areas to be drier.
9. Elevation refers to how high above sea level a location is.

                            15. Q1. Is the climate of these cities the same? Why?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Yes - Because its a open land, have a parks and bodies of water can create cooler areas within a city. Temperatures are typically lower at suburban-rural borders than in downtown areas. In general, temperatures are different at the surface of the earth and in the atmospheric air, higher above the city<p></p>As you increase in elevation, there is less air above you thus the pressure decreases. As the pressure decreases, air molecules spread out further (i.e. air expands) and the temperature decreases. If the humidity is at 100 percent (because it's snowing), the temperature decreases more slowly with height.<p></p><p>Places at the same latitude may have very different climates if one is on a coast and one is inland. On the coast, the climate is influenced by warm moist air from the ocean. </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p>Visit related link:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/13805026</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/15817339</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>13. Places at the same latitude may have very different climates if one is on a coast and one is inland. On the coast, the climate is influenced by warm moist air from the ocean. ... Farther inland, the climate is influenced by cold or hot air from the land. This air may be dry, because it comes from over land.</p><p></p><p>14.Greenhouse gases include water vapour, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, ozone and some artificial chemicals such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs).</p><p> </p><p>15.Among the given choices, the correct answer is letter d (all of these). Latitude, altitude and topography are likely most factors affect the climate of a city that is surrounded by bodies of water, has a moderate climate and located near the equator.</p><p></p><p>16. As temperatures rise due to high carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere, regions that have so far been too cold for the mosquitoes are getting warmer. As a result, regions like Europe may see unprecedented growth in mosquito population in a few decades</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />
