                                            Invite your family members and nearby neighbors to a problem solving game. You must be even in number with a minimum of six to join the game (but the more, the better!). Stand in a circle. People with rings that have sharp edges or engravings should remove them. Ask each person to put their left hand in the circle and hold someone else's hand, but not the person's next to them (for example across them). Then they should do the same with the right hand, but they should hold on to a different person's hand. You now have a problem: you are all tangled! You need to solve the problem of untangling yourselves to form a large circle. You cannot lose contact with the hands you are holding. You cannot break the grip but you can loosen it. Ask your family members and friends how quickly they think you can all undo the knot to get back to the circle. (It usually takes longer than people think it will!) Tell them that you have a maximum of 5 minutes for the game. Let the game begin!​</a>

                            4. Invite your family members and nearby neighbors to a problem solving game. You must be even in number with a minimum of six to join the game (but the more, the better!). Stand in a circle. People with rings that have sharp edges or engravings should remove them. Ask each person to put their left hand in the circle and hold someone else's hand, but not the person's next to them (for example across them). Then they should do the same with the right hand, but they should hold on to a different person's hand. You now have a problem: you are all tangled! You need to solve the problem of untangling yourselves to form a large circle. You cannot lose contact with the hands you are holding. You cannot break the grip but you can loosen it. Ask your family members and friends how quickly they think you can all undo the knot to get back to the circle. (It usually takes longer than people think it will!) Tell them that you have a maximum of 5 minutes for the game. Let the game begin!​</h2><br />
