                                            What's New What Messages can either be heard or read. We can easily differentiate a positive from a negative message upon hearing the tone (the speaker's attitude in saying the message) and the mood (the feeling inflicted to the listener) of the speaker. What if he's in a bad mood? I have to put my toys away! It is easily recognized that the message conveyed is negative While reading a text entails literal comprehension or understanding what is directly stated, it also requires interpretation through visible expressions, signs, and symbols, which - just like audible tone- - are easy to identify whether positively or negatively meant.​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. sensory image is a strategy readers use to think more deeply about a text. It is when a reader combines their schema and the information in the text to create an image in their mind. This image can represent all of the five senses (visual, smell, taste, sound, touch, or feeling).</p><p>2. Imagery can make something abstract, like an emotion or theory, seem more concrete and tangible to the reader. By using imagery, writers can evoke the feeling they want to talk about in their readers...and by making their readers feel, writers can also help readers connect to the messages in their work.</p><p>3. sensory images also help a reader draw on specific details in the text (e.g. a character's thoughts, words, or actions; elements of tone, meaning, or beauty of a text), creating an interaction between the reader and the text.</p><p>4. Sensory language enhances your writing and immerses your reader in the scene. It helps the reader to visualize, hear, and imagine the scenario, so they can experience it rather than just digest the information you're trying to convey.</p><p>5. Language that connects with tangible and sensory (taste, smell, touch, sight, and sound) is easier for readers to understand and relate to.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Hope it helps:)</p><br />

                            25. Grammar is the study of the way words are used to make sentences. It explains the forms of structure of words (called morphology) and how they are arranged in sentences (called syntax). In other words, grammar provides the rules for common use of both spoken and written language so we can more easily understand each other. It helps in making the structure precise, clear, and accurate. Eliminate grammatical errors in making a definition and reward your readers with clear communication.​</h2><br />
