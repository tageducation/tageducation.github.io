                        <p>Dr. King worked to ensure that everyone had an <strong>equal chance</strong> at <strong>success </strong>and that <strong>justice </strong>and <strong>prosperity </strong>coexisted rather than clashed.</p><p> <strong>  </strong>    Dr. King's steadfast commitment to <strong>racial equality, civil rights, </strong>and <strong>justice </strong>for all contributed to the speech's potency. Over 250,000 people joined him in his belief in the strength of his cause and the beauty of a brighter future. Any change you attempt to make without conviction is likely to fail. On the eve of his passing, King declared, "We have a chance to make America a better country. "I might not accompany you there. But I want you to know this evening that our group will reach the Promised Land. The notion of <strong>economic justice</strong> holds that a more just economy will prosper. The objective is to provide everyone with equal possibilities for success and to ensure that justice and prosperity coexist rather than conflict. Social justice, on the other hand, is fairness as it appears in society.</p><p>     Fairness in <strong>housing</strong>, <strong>employment</strong>, <strong>healthcare</strong>, and other areas are included. Four fundamental objectives—human rights, access, participation, and equity—are necessary for social justice. He urged the people of the United States to fight for a nation where everyone would enjoy equal rights. He would have seen that Americans are getting closer to turning this nation into the promised land of liberty and equality if he were still living.</p><p></p><p>Learn more about <strong>Dr. King's Speech</strong>: brainly.ph/question/8795503</p><p><strong>#SPJ5</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>While designating a day of service in his honor is a step in the right direction, is there more we can do to honor his legacy? I wonder if we might better honor Dr. King by reflecting on what he meant by the promised land, and by taking bolder steps to make equality a reality. While many of his speeches address racial inequality specifically, over time inequality has evolved to encompass much more than race alone. Maybe he was really talking about basic civil rights, honoring human dignity and supporting equal opportunity for everyone.</p><p></p><p>Civil Rights are defined as the rights of individuals to receive equal treatment (and to be free from unfair treatment or “discrimination”) in a number of settings — including education, employment, housing and more — and based on certain legally protected characteristics. We at the National Center for Learning and Civic Engagement are continually reminded of one example of inequity — the glaring civic opportunity gap that persists in education today.</p><p></p><p>This gap is a roadblock to our children’s ability to learn how to thrive as part of a democracy, and to our ability as a society to grow and evolve. The civic opportunity gap is a civil rights issue, and we must teach our children how to be civic actors.</p><p></p><p>During another one of his public addresses, Dr. King was quoted as saying, “society’s punishments are small compared to the wounds we inflict on our soul when we look the other way.” When we look the other way. What price will we pay if we continue to dismiss the importance of doing something about this widening gap? What is it going to take for any substantial change to occur? How many more Ferguson-like events will this country have to endure before we collectively embrace the reality that though we are, in fact all created equal, our system is flawed? Have we really forgotten that all children in America have a right to a quality education regardless of where they live, what their parents do (or don’t do) for a living, what they look like or how they speak?</p><p></p><p>We cannot afford to continue looking the other way. Doing the right thing is often the hard thing because it’s messy and complicated and requires an all-hands-on-deck mentality, but it’s time. It was time long ago, and we have the capacity to make positive change.</p><p></p><p>The reward for making equity a priority in this country will be well worth the discomfort and the struggle. If we do not work to instill in our youth the value of civic engagement, and teach all children, including minorities and the disadvantaged what it means to care about their community and how to build self-efficacy, that “promised land” will remain little more than a mirage. We’ll never get there.</p><p></p><p>On April 4, 1968, in his speech in Indianapolis announcing the death of Martin Luther King, Jr., Robert F. Kennedy posed some pointed questions when he asked, “What kind of nation are we?” “What direction do we want to move in?” It’s time to face the music. If anyone can do this, we can.</p><p></p><p>Lisa Guilfoile is a project leader for the National Center for Learning and Civic Engagement (NCLCE) at the Education Commission of the States.

                        <p>The declaration of independence is one of the <strong>most important</strong> milestones in <strong>Philippine history</strong>. The country was colonized by many nations for hundreds of years. Imagine achieving your freedom after all the hardships you've been through.

                            15. how does the church at present manifist the same proclamation done by jesus​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>From the beginning, the Church was part of God’s plan for sharing his divine life with all people. There was a gradual formation of God’s family through a series of events described in the Old Testament: God’s covenant with Abraham as the father of a great people, the liberation of ancient Israel from slavery in Egypt and their establishment in the Promised Land, and their solidification as a nation through the kingship of David.</p><p>Jesus brought about the fulfillment of the Father’s plan for the Church first by His preaching and witnessing the Good News of the Kingdom, with its gifts of salvation from sin and participation in divine life. The seed and beginning of the Kingdom was the little flock whom Jesus shepherded as his family. Jesus established the beginnings of a visible structure of the Church that will remain until the Kingdom is fully achieved, through his choice of the Twelve Apostles, with Peter as the head.By His Cross, Jesus gave birth to the Church.</p><br />

3.Did this proclamation help you understand vividly the Independence of our country? Why?
4.Could we consider our country fully independent after June 12, 1898? Support your answer.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.  Just like studying history, re-examining the proclamation of our country the Philippines helps us understand more of the origins of how the Philippines' are like this now, when, and why did our country become like this as of currently. It's not talking about the situation the Philippines are having right now, it's pertaining about the fact that why we achieved and made to have such situations, which in portrayal, from the Independence of our country is the origin behind our countries' decisions now, which is made and decided not by other foreign countries, but us and us only, so that includes only because of our country, not from the others. </p><p>Also, it enables us to trace some connected things which are happening now, like the things that our country holds power as of the Independency, but still claimed by the others. We can establish methods and ways to propagate logical reasons through our Independency and use the date of the proclamation to range the collected data of the arbitrator. </p><p></p><p>2. It's interesting. </p><p></p><p>3. Yes. I understood that without the proclamation, then, of course, there's no Independence. </p><p></p><p>4. Actually, a country being Independent doesn't mean that its people will directly act the same way too. A country may be independent right after its proclamation, but the nation, including the country and its people, can't fully able to adopt the things that they can do as of the Independency just right after. We are not robots, we can't directly receive and adapt to things we are just given to like codes being conferred to.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

The winner of the 1963 Nobel Peace Prize was born in Atlanta, Georgia, USA on January 15, 1929. King was the son of Pastor <strong>Martin Luther King, Jr</strong>.  and Alberta Williams King.  King completed his education at Morehouse College in sociology.  And from Crozer Theological Seminary, Pennsylvania, he managed to get a Bachelor of Divinity (Bachelor of Theology) degree in 1951.

                            23. based on this proclamation how would america support each other</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., challenged our Nation to recognize that our individual liberty relies upon our common equality. In communities marred by division and injustice, the movement he built from the ground up forced open doors to negotiation. The strength of his leadership was matched only by the power of his words, which still call on us to perfect those sacred ideals enshrined in our founding documents.
</p><p>
</p><p>"We have an opportunity to make America a better Nation," Dr. King said on the eve of his death. "I may not get there with you. But I want you to know tonight that we, as a people, will get to the promised land." Though we have made great strides since the turbulent era of Dr. King's movement, his work and our journey remain unfinished. Only when our children are free to pursue their full measure of success -- unhindered by the color of their skin, their gender, the faith in their heart, the people they love, or the fortune of their birth -- will we have reached our destination.
</p><p>
</p><p>Today, we are closer to fulfilling America's promise of economic and social justice because we stand on the shoulders of giants like Dr. King, yet our future progress will depend on how we prepare our next generation of leaders. We must fortify their ladders of opportunity by correcting social injustice, breaking the cycle of poverty in struggling communities, and reinvesting in our schools. Education can unlock a child's potential and remains our strongest weapon against injustice and inequality.
</p><p>
</p><p>Recognizing that our Nation has yet to reach Dr. King's promised land is not an admission of defeat, but a call to action. In these challenging times, too many Americans face limited opportunities, but our capacity to support each other remains limitless. Today, let us ask ourselves what Dr. King believed to be life's most urgent and persistent question: "What are you doing for others?" Visit www.MLKDay.gov to find Martin Luther King, Jr., Day of Service projects across our country.
</p><p>
</p><p>Dr. King devoted his life to serving others, and his message transcends national borders. The devastating earthquake in Haiti, and the urgent need for humanitarian support, reminds us that our service and generosity of spirit must also extend beyond our immediate communities. As our Government continues to bring our resources to bear on the international emergency in Haiti, I ask all Americans who want to contribute to this effort to visit www.WhiteHouse.gov/HaitiEarthquake.
</p><p>
</p><p>By lifting up our brothers and sisters through dedication and service -- both at home and around the world -- we honor Dr. King's memory and reaffirm our common humanity.

</p><p>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim January 18, 2010, as the Martin Luther King, Jr., Federal Holiday. I encourage all Americans to observe this day with appropriate civic, community, and service programs in honor of Dr. King's life and lasting legacy.
