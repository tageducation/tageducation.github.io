</p><p>Answer:
</p><p>
</p><p>Harmful to the environment and living things.
</p><p>
</p><p>Explanation:
</p><p>
</p><p>What is EM Radiation?
</p><p>
</p><p>EM Radiation is the short form of Electromagnetic Radiation. In physics, Electromagnetic Radiation is made up of waves of the electromagnetic field. They are carrying electromagnetic radiant energy which are both good and harmful to the body if used irresponsibly. It includes Gamma Rays, X-rays. Ultraviolet, light, infrared, microwaves and radio waves. Altogether, they would form an electromagnetic spectrum.
</p><p>
</p><p>These are the harmful effects
</p><p>
</p><p>Ultraviolet
</p><p>
</p><p>Ultraviolet can cause serious irritation and diseases to the skin. Ultraviolet radiation can also cause damages that are sometimes not curable Long exposure to the sun can also contribute to ultraviolet rays. Some of the harmful effects of UltraViolet rays include skin cancer, which are classified as melanoma or nonmelanoma. Premature aging of the skin and other damages can also result if no proper protection is used to UV exposure, Cataracts and other eye damage would be an addition to the health effects especially if no protection against UV rays is used. Aside from all of these, ummune system suppresion would be the worst.
</p><p>X-Ray
</p><p>
</p><p>In a clinic or hospital, if someone needs to have an X-ray, the doctor of staff would always ask the female patient if she is pregnant or not. If she is or thinks she is, the doctor or staff would not go with the procedure. This is because of the harmful effects of X-ray to the body. The light from X-ray machine could go inside and might affect the fetus or life inside the womb. If exposed to high radiation, they can seriously cause cancer. There are also short-term effects of exposure to x-rays such as hair-loss, vomiting, bleeding, fainting, hair loss and loss of skin and hair.
</p><p>Gamma-Ray
</p><p>
</p><p>Just like lead, Gamma rays are so powerful that they can penetrate to the skin deeply. It would be so hard to stop or block the Gamma Rays that even a large stack of concretes is not enough to block them. Whenever Gamma-rays pass through the body, they can seriously damage the tissue and DNA. It would be so hard for the experts and doctors to cure these types of damages since they require high expertise to go deeper with the human body.

                        <strong>Answer:</strong><p><strong>1.)</strong> The presence of electromagnetic radiation in the environment impacts the magnetic properties of all biological tissues to some degree. As a result, all living things, including plants, microorganisms, animals, and people, are environmental markers of electromagnetic radiation exposure.</p><p><strong>2.) </strong> An electric field accelerates an atomic particle, such as an electron, causing it to travel, resulting in EM radiation. The motion causes oscillating electric and magnetic fields, which travel in a bundle of light energy called a photon at right angles to each other.</p><p><strong>3.) </strong> Radio frequencies have a larger wavelength of roughly 10 m, which allows them to penetrate deeper into the material and heat dense materials. They heat more slowly than microwaves, allowing them to handle more delicate items that require a slower heat.</p><p><strong>4.) </strong> Certain forms of electromagnetic radiation can be dangerous if exposed to too much of them.

                        <strong>Answer:</strong><p><strong>Electromagnetic </strong>fields are ubiquitous in our environment but are invisible to the naked eye. Electric fields are generated when thunderstorms cause a localized buildup of electric charges in the atmosphere. The earth's magnetic field induces a compass needle to point north-south, which is utilized for navigation by birds and fish. EMF exposure is not a new occurrence. Throughout the twentieth century, however, environmental exposure to artificial electromagnetic fields has continuously increased as expanding electrical demand, ever-advancing technology, and changes in social behavior have resulted in the creation of an increasing number of synthetic sources. Everyone is exposed to an intricate mixture of weak electric and magnetic fields, both at home and at work, ranging from power generation and transmission to domestic appliances and industrial equipment, as well as telecommunications and broadcasting.</p><p></p><p><strong>For more information, you may visit these links:</strong></p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/13114709</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/96865</p>#BrainlyEveryday<br />

                        <p></p><p>What are the effects of electromagnetic waves in our environment?</p><p></p><p>Not much apart from their intended effects, usually. Radio and TV broadcasts fill the air but we don’t perceive them and are not affected by them - unless we use appropriate equipment to receive their data comtent.</p><p></p><p>Some transmitters radiate very high power EM waves. These can heat you up, as in a microwave oven. Care is taken to exclude people from the dangerous areas. (But the myth is that ready-cooked ducks fall out of the beam of over-the-horizon radars!)</p><p></p><p>Some consumer equipment intentionally transmits EM energy - WiFi and mobile phones for example. There has been some concern that radiating energy from mobile phones held so close to the head can cook your brain. But the power is too small and any minor heating will be dissipated by the blood circulation. Many studies have shown no discernable harm. If this worries you, use a headset so the transmitter is away from your body by a couple of cm.</p><p></p><p>Caution - some body parts do not have enough blood circulation for this to work. Famous examples are eyeballs and the other balls. So don’t use your mobile held next to those bits!</p><p></p><p>WiFi routers are normally far enough away that heating effects are less than negigible.</p><p></p><p>As well as ‘intentional transmitters’ there are unintended sources of EM energy - industrial welders, heaters, medical diagnostic kit etc. Their use is regulated to keep the public safe, slightly less safe for their operators.</p><p></p><p>But what about effects other than heating? After all this is ‘radiation’? Well, EM waves up to light frequency do not have enough energy per photon to damage (ionise) matter. Infra-red radiation may heat you but ultra-violet destroys skin cells, for example. Radio waves are much less energetic than infra-red so are not a risk.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Harmful to the environment and living things.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>What is EM Radiation?</p><p></p><p>EM Radiation is the short form of Electromagnetic Radiation. In physics, Electromagnetic Radiation is made up of waves of the electromagnetic field. They are carrying electromagnetic radiant energy which are both good and harmful to the body if used irresponsibly. It includes Gamma Rays, X-rays. Ultraviolet, light, infrared, microwaves and radio waves. Altogether, they would form an electromagnetic spectrum.</p><p></p><p>These are the harmful effects</p><p></p><p>Ultraviolet</p><p></p><p>Ultraviolet can cause serious irritation and diseases to the skin. Ultraviolet radiation can also cause damages that are sometimes not curable Long exposure to the sun can also contribute to ultraviolet rays. Some of the harmful effects of UltraViolet rays include skin cancer, which are classified as melanoma or nonmelanoma. Premature aging of the skin and other damages can also result if no proper protection is used to UV exposure, Cataracts and other eye damage would be an addition to the health effects especially if no protection against UV rays is used. Aside from all of these, ummune system suppresion would be the worst.</p><p>X-Ray</p><p></p><p>In a clinic or hospital, if someone needs to have an X-ray, the doctor of staff would always ask the female patient if she is pregnant or not. If she is or thinks she is, the doctor or staff would not go with the procedure. This is because of the harmful effects of X-ray to the body. The light from X-ray machine could go inside and might affect the fetus or life inside the womb. If exposed to high radiation, they can seriously cause cancer. There are also short-term effects of exposure to x-rays such as hair-loss, vomiting, bleeding, fainting, hair loss and loss of skin and hair.</p><p>Gamma-Ray</p><p></p><p>Just like lead, Gamma rays are so powerful that they can penetrate to the skin deeply. It would be so hard to stop or block the Gamma Rays that even a large stack of concretes is not enough to block them. Whenever Gamma-rays pass through the body, they can seriously damage the tissue and DNA. It would be so hard for the experts and doctors to cure these types of damages since they require high expertise to go deeper with the human body.</p><p>To know more about why X-rays and Gamma rays pose more health hazards than low-frequency EM waves, you may head over to this link brainly.ph/question/21364810.</p><p></p><p> #BrainlyEveryday</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p>Answer:</p><p>Q1. All living tissues have magnetic properties that are affected to some extent by the existence of electromagnetic radiation in the environment. Therefore all living creatures including plants, microbes, animals and humans are environmental indicators of exposure to electromagnetic radiation.<br /></p><p>Q2. EM radiation is created when an atomic particle, such as an electron, is accelerated by an electric field, causing it to move. The movement produces oscillating electric and magnetic fields, which travel at right angles to each other in a bundle of light energy called a photon.</p><p><br />Q3. Advantages of radio frequency technology- Thanks to their longer wavelength, around 10 m, radio frequencies can penetrate deeply into the material and thus heat thick products. They heat more slowly than microwaves and thus make it possible to treat more delicate products which require a slower heating.</p><p><br />Q4. Hazards of electromagnetic radiation</p><p>- microwaves cause internal heating of body tissues.</p><p>-infrared radiation is felt as heat and causes skin to burn.</p><p>- X-rays damage cells causing mutations (which may lead to cancer) and cell death this is why doctors and dentists stand behind protective screens when taking lots of X-rays.</p><p></p><p>Q5.

                        EM Radiation  <p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong>
</p><p>Harmful to the environment and living things.
</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong>
</p><p><strong>What is EM Radiation?</strong>
</p><p>EM Radiation is the short form of Electromagnetic Radiation. In physics, Electromagnetic Radiation is made up of waves of the electromagnetic field. They are carrying electromagnetic radiant energy which are both good and harmful to the body if used irresponsibly. It includes Gamma Rays, X-rays. Ultraviolet, light, infrared, microwaves and radio waves. Altogether, they would form an electromagnetic spectrum.
</p><p></p><p>These are the harmful effects</p><p></p><p><strong>Ultraviolet</strong>
</p>Ultraviolet can cause serious irritation and diseases to the skin. Ultraviolet radiation can also cause damages that are sometimes not curable Long exposure to the sun can also contribute to ultraviolet rays. Some of the harmful effects of UltraViolet rays include skin cancer, which are classified as melanoma or nonmelanoma. Premature aging of the skin and other damages can also result if no proper protection is used to UV exposure, Cataracts and other eye damage would be an addition to the health effects especially if no protection against UV rays is used. Aside from all of these, ummune system suppresion would be the worst.
<p></p><p>X-Ray
</p>In a clinic or hospital, if someone needs to have an X-ray, the doctor of staff would always ask the female patient if she is pregnant or not. If she is or thinks she is, the doctor or staff would not go with the procedure. This is because of the harmful effects of X-ray to the body. The light from X-ray machine could go inside and might affect the fetus or life inside the womb. If exposed to high radiation, they can seriously cause cancer. There are also short-term effects of exposure to x-rays such as hair-loss, vomiting, bleeding, fainting, hair loss and loss of skin and hair.
<p></p><p>Gamma-Ray
</p>Just like lead, Gamma rays are so powerful that they can penetrate to the skin deeply. It would be so hard to stop or block the Gamma Rays that even a large stack of concretes is not enough to block them. Whenever Gamma-rays pass through the body, they can seriously damage the tissue and DNA. It would be so hard for the experts and doctors to cure these types of damages since they require high expertise to go deeper with the human body.
