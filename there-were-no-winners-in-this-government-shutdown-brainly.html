Obama: ‘There Were No Winners

                            5. What is the issue presented in the speech of Obama:there were no winners in this government shutdown?</h2><br />
                        <p>The former president Barrack Obama aims to encourage each and everyone not think that the government is not their opponent. Barrack Obama tried to explain and elaborate everything that people should know and not hide something from them under his term. But still, some people don't put their trust on Barack Obama's words. In his speech, he discussed the issue of budget, local job when it comes to their immigration system, and passing a farm bill. </p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>In 2016 and beyond, our nation's leaders will be well served by an unsentimental appraisal of Obama's record. When it comes to the critically important and symbolically potent issue of education, the notion that the Obama administration's approach has been post-partisan, pragmatic, and measured is a myth. Ultimately, Obama's education-reform agenda amounted to a stimulus-funded race to bureaucracy, a call to do for higher education what the Affordable Care Act has done for health care, a push to expand Washington's role, and a carte blanche for the aggressive lawyers at the U.S. Department of Education.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.]There’s been a lot of discussion lately of the politics of this shutdown. But the truth is, there were no winners in this. At a time when our economy needs more growth and more jobs, the manufactured crises of these last few weeks actually harmed jobs and growth.</p><p>2.]There is no choice between growth and fiscal responsibility – we need both. So we’re making a serious mistake if a budget doesn’t focus on what you’re focused on: creating more good jobs that pay better wages. If we’re going to free up resources for the things that help us grow – education, infrastructure, research – we should cut what we don’t need, and close corporate tax loopholes that don’t help create jobs.
</p><p>This shouldn’t be as difficult as it has been in past years. Remember, our deficits are shrinking – not growing. Second, we should finish the job of fixing our broken immigration system. There’s already a broad coalition across America that’s behind this effort, from business leaders to faith leaders to law enforcement. It would grow our economy. It would secure our borders. The Senate has already passed a bill with strong bipartisan support. Now the House should, too. The majority of Americans thinks this is the right thing to do. It can and should get done by the end of this year. Third, we should pass a farm bill – one that America’s farmers and ranchers can depend on, one that protects vulnerable children and adults in times of need, and one that gives rural communities opportunities to grow and the longer-term certainty they deserve. We won’t suddenly agree on everything now that the cloud of crisis has passed. But we shouldn’t hold back on places where we do agree, just because we don’t think it’s good politics, or just because the extremes in our parties don’t like compromise. I’ll look for willing partners from either party to get important work done. There’s no good reason why we can’t govern responsibly, without lurching from manufactured crisis to manufactured crisis. Because that isn’t governing – it’s just hurting the people we were sent here to serve. Those of us who have the privilege to serve this country have an obligation to do our job the best we can. We come from different parties, but we’re Americans first. And our obligations to you must compel all of us, Democrats and Republicans, to cooperate, and compromise, and act in the best interests of this country we love</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        What is the issue presented in the speech of Obama:there were no winners in this government shutdown?
<p>
</p><p>Obama delivered a speech in response to his critics. He discussed concerns that had plagued the nation previous to his term of office.
</p><p>  </p><p><strong>1. Economy</strong>
</p>This is a make-or-break time for the middle class, and President Obama is trying to create an economy that works for everyone—where hard work and responsibility are rewarded.
<p>
</p><p><strong>2. Education</strong>
</p>President Obama insists that every child needs access to the kind of schooling they need to prepare for the demands of a new century.
<p></p><p><strong>3.Energy and the Environment</strong>
</p>President Obama is building the foundation for a renewable energy future, combating climate change and preserving our atmosphere.
<p>
</p><p><strong>4. Immigration</strong>
</p>The immigration structure of our country is fractured. Fixing this is an imperative of economic and national security. That's why President Obama is working on a common sense, a substantive series of reforms that guarantees that everybody follows the same laws.
<p>
</p><p><strong>5. Health Care</strong>
</p>President Obama is changing health care to ensure a safer future for American families.
