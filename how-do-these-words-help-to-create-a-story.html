After reading, evaluatethe short story using the criteria below. Then, Write a brief review in the comment section.Proud Little PencilBy Joemar L. Furigay"Pencils? They're very unfortunatel" mocked those bom with the privilege of ink."They're dull, too!" mimicked those born with the privilege of color."Truly unlucky!" they chorused in derisionLittle Pencil felt depressed upon hearing what the Pens and Crayons told about themPencils. True, he came from the Pencil family, and he was bound to carry out a Pencil's job. Andhe wasn't proud of thatIt was the role of Pencils to do the first part of any work. The Pens would then trace toperfection what the Pencils had started, leaving no traces of their initial efforts. Then, the Crayonswould brighten the Pens' work, making the Pencils go unnoticed. Such was the norm where thePens and the Crayons would be in the spotlight while the Pencils would always stay on thesidelinesLittle Pencil knew the Pencil family worked hard, but he couldn't understand why they werehappy even if they were underappreciated."Mom, I don't want to be a pencil anymore," he grumbled."Dear, you need to know that we Pencils are as good as the Pens and Crayons," hismother repliedThat's clearly untrue, Mom!" Little Pencil protested."W not true, then tell me why pens need us to create perfect lines?" Mother Pencil asked.Little Pencil replied with a sigh."Pens and crayons are unable to correct their mistakes while we, pencils, can," MotherPencil continued. We don'tget recognized most of the time, but it doesn't mean we can't shine,"she explained.Little Pencil mumbled, "But pens cover our marks, and crayons make them look alive.""But we guide them, dear son," Mother Pencil countered, "they can't produce great workswithout us starting them.""And that makes you independent because you don't need help to create something,"Mother Pencil explained."Pens, crayons and pencils have their own ups and downs, and believe me when I saywe're all the same," she said. "We pencils create, so do pens and crayons. We make mistakes,so do they.""But the Pens and the Crayons would always steal the credit!" Little Pencil complained,holding back his tears."But without us, they won't shine," Mother Pencil wiped his tears away. We are asimportant as they are. There's something better than being noticed, son."Little Pencil asked, "What could be better than being noticed, Mom?""It is knowing you have a purpose and believing you are more than what you appear tobe," Mother Pencil answered."You yourself should know how important you are and how beautiful your role is in thisworld," Mother Pencil pointed out as she hugged Little Pencil. "For me, there's no better feelingthan leaming to love yourself and realizing how important you are," she stressed.Little Pencil gave a sheepish smile, all he needed was his mother's enlightening words.Never had he been proud of what he was and who he was. At last, he was ready to introducehimself to the world."Lam a pen. I make drawings pop outl" proclaimed someone from the family of pens."I am a crayon. I make these drawings colorfull" declared someone from the family ofcrayons."I am a pencil. I make those drawings happenl" asserted Little Pencil, who came from thefamily of pencilsNever had he been this prouder! ​​ ​</a>

                                            Enumeration is a rhetorical device used for listing details, or a process of mentioning words orphrases step by step. In fact, it is a type of amplification or division in which a subject is further distributedinto components or parts. Writers use enumeration to elucidate a topic, to make it understandable for thereaders. It also helps avoid ambiguity in the minds of the readers.By using enumeration, writers lay emphasis on certain ideas to elaborate them further. In fact,enumeration easily creates an impression on the minds of the readers. The details and listing make it easyfor them to convey the real message they want to impart. However, if there is no use of enumeration in atext, it might become difficult for the reader to get the true meanings of ideas.Directions: Complete the table below.1.

                                            Previously, you were introduced and taught of what a personal pronoun is and how it’s
different from an indefinite pronoun. In this part of the module, you are again to learn more
about pronouns. These are the interrogative and relative pronouns. Again, let us continue
doing the activities here.
INTERROGATIVE AND RELATIVE PRONOUNS
Interrogative pronoun is in a question. It helps to ask about something.
Interrogative pronouns are, what, which, who, whom, and whose.
Examples:
● What on earth is that?
● What do you want for dinner?
● Which color do you prefer?
● Which seat would you lie?
● Who is going to take out the trash?
● Who was driving the car?
● Whom do you prefer to vote for?
● Whom do you live with?
● Whose sweater is that?
● Whose parents are those?
Relative pronoun introduces a clause, or part of a sentence, that describes a noun. The most
common relative pronouns are who, whom, whose, which, and that. Sometimes when and where
can be used as relative pronouns as well. Relative pronoun is placed directly after the noun it
modifies.
7
Examples:
● The driver, who ran the stop sign. was careless.
● The children, whom we love dearly, need better educations.
● I have a friend whose cat is adorable.
● The book, which is now out of print, has all the information you need.
● This is the book that everyone is talking about.
In each example above, the subject of the sentence is described by a relative clause (italicized).
As these clauses describe a noun, they are also known as adjective clauses, because they act
like adjectives in the sentence. Each clause is introduced by a relative pronoun (in bold).
Relative pronouns connect the description to the rest of the sentence in an orderly way.
In the first sentence, the relative pronoun who together with the other words, “who ran the stop
sign”
is a relative clause that describes the driver, thus, the clause is used as an adjective for it
describes the noun, driver.
The same with the second sentence, the relative pronoun whom with the other words, “whom we
love dearly”, as the relative clause and as an adjective clause describes the noun children. In
the third sentence, “whose cat is adorable” modifies the noun friend. In the fourth sentence,
“which is now out of print” modifies the noun book, and in the last sentence, “that everyone is
talking about describes the noun book.

Interrogative Pronouns
An interrogative pronoun is used in a question. It helps ask about something or someone.
The interrogative pronouns are: what, which, who, whom, and compound words ending
in “ever,” such as, whatever, whichever, whoever, and whomever.
Examples:
What on earth is that? Who ate the last fig Newton?
An interrogative pronoun may look like an interrogative adjective, but it is used differently
in a sentence: it acts as a pronoun, taking the place of a noun.
Indefinite Pronouns
An indefinite pronoun refers to an indefinite, or general, person or thing. Indefinite
pronouns include all, any, both, each, everyone, few, many, neither, none, nothing,
several, some, and somebody.
Examples:
Something smells good. Many like salsa with their chips.
An indefinite pronoun may look like an indefinite adjective, but it is used differently in a
sentence: it acts as a pronoun, taking the place of a noun.
Relative Pronouns
A relative pronoun introduces a clause, or part of a sentence, that describes a noun. The
relative pronouns are that, which, who, and whom.
Examples:
You should bring the book that you love most.
That introduces “you love most,” which describes the book.

Bryan, Cha and Dex to reveal that he was diagnosed with cancer and will soon be
dying with only seven weeks left to live. Because of the news that hit the family, the
Bonifacio siblings reunite and help
each other to spend their father's remaining days
with him. Even though, they have their personal issues and differences, they decide
to do this for their father. Everything goes well when they spend Sundays with their
father. They reminisce childhood and teenage memories. As they spend more time,
they get to know each other again. Each has his/her own problems which are
unknown to the other sibling. The eldest son, Allan, and the second son, Brian have a
talk about Brian's troubles.
One day, the father receives a call from his doctor stating that he made a
wrong diagnosis. The father does not reveal this to his kids until the truth is found out
by the eldest son. They have a talk, and the father explains why he decided not to tell
the truth. The eldest son, Allan, expresses his feelings about the whole situation and
convinces the father to reveal the truth in their next get-together. At the start of the
get-together, the youngest son, Dex, finds out about his sister's marital problems. The
whole family also finds out about Dex's troubles and have a confrontation with Brian.
Cha's problems are brought out in the open, too. In the process of all the
confrontation, their father's real condition is revealed, and this surprises Brian and Cha.
This creates an exchange of painful words against the siblings and unearthing of past
pains.
After a couple of days, Allan apologizes to Brian and they patch things up. They
both take the chance to apologize to Dex, as well. All three go to Cha's house to visit
her and check her situation. All four meet their father at their mother's grave and they
talk to their dad about how they appreciate his sacrifices for the family. They work out
their issues and resolve hurt emotions. The story ends with the revival of Allan's store,
fun activities, a dance showdown.

The population of mantapoli was numerous and fast increasing. at that time, the world was divided into two regions:Sebangan. because this sultanate rapidly increased in power and population, the equilibrium between Sebangan and sedpan was broken. This disequilibrium soon came to the attention of archangel diabarail (Gabriel to the christians). Like a flash of sunlight, diabarail flew to the Eighth heaven and told Allah: my Lord, why have you permitted the UN balance of the earth? Sebangan, because of the power of mantapoli, is now heavier than sedpan. Why, Diabarail replied the sohara (Voice of Allah), what is wrong with that? My Lord, mantapoli has a vast population, countless as the particles of dust. If we will allow this sultanate to remain in Sebangan, I fear that the world would turn upside down. Since sebangan is heavier than sedpan. Your words show great wisdom, diabarail, commented the sohara. what must we do my Lord,​</a>

                                            Read the essay in the box and do what is asked.Some people believe that everyone needs a college degree. Educationis important, but I don’t think a four-year university education is needed tobe successful in our society.Electricians, plumbers, and carpenters go through specialized trainingin their fields. They don’t need to be college graduates to do their work.Blue-collar workers are the backbones of our society. Where would we be ifno one took vocational training? Who would repair our cars and unclog oursinks? The college-educated professional won’t do it. Unskilled work isimportant too. Dishwashers and taxi drivers may not have even a highschool education, but many people rely on the services they provide.On the other hand, a practical education combined with college coursesin business administration might mean the difference between being anelectrician and owning a successful electrical contracting business. BillGates is a good example. He started building computers from kits when hewas in high school. He went to Harvard for a while, but he dropped out sothat he could pursue his own idea of creating an operating system forpersonal computers. He invented DOS (disk operating system) andfounded Microsoft.In conclusion, people should have a chance to receive the highestlevel of education that their potential and effort allow.

They're very unfortunatel" mocked those bom with the privilege of ink."They're dull, too!" mimicked those born with the privilege of color."Truly unlucky!" they chorused in derisionLittle Pencil felt depressed upon hearing what the Pens and Crayons told about themPencils. True, he came from the Pencil family, and he was bound to carry out a Pencil's job. Andhe wasn't proud of thatIt was the role of Pencils to do the first part of any work. The Pens would then trace toperfection what the Pencils had started, leaving no traces of their initial efforts. Then, the Crayonswould brighten the Pens' work, making the Pencils go unnoticed. Such was the norm where thePens and the Crayons would be in the spotlight while the Pencils would always stay on thesidelinesLittle Pencil knew the Pencil family worked hard, but he couldn't understand why they werehappy even if they were underappreciated."Mom, I don't want to be a pencil anymore," he grumbled."Dear, you need to know that we Pencils are as good as the Pens and Crayons," hismother repliedThat's clearly untrue, Mom!" Little Pencil protested."W not true, then tell me why pens need us to create perfect lines?" Mother Pencil asked.Little Pencil replied with a sigh."Pens and crayons are unable to correct their mistakes while we, pencils, can," MotherPencil continued. We don'tget recognized most of the time, but it doesn't mean we can't shine,"she explained.Little Pencil mumbled, "But pens cover our marks, and crayons make them look alive.""But we guide them, dear son," Mother Pencil countered, "they can't produce great workswithout us starting them.""And that makes you independent because you don't need help to create something,"Mother Pencil explained."Pens, crayons and pencils have their own ups and downs, and believe me when I saywe're all the same," she said. "We pencils create, so do pens and crayons. We make mistakes,so do they.""But the Pens and the Crayons would always steal the credit!" Little Pencil complained,holding back his tears."But without us, they won't shine," Mother Pencil wiped his tears away. We are asimportant as they are. There's something better than being noticed, son."Little Pencil asked, "What could be better than being noticed, Mom?""It is knowing you have a purpose and believing you are more than what you appear tobe," Mother Pencil answered."You yourself should know how important you are and how beautiful your role is in thisworld," Mother Pencil pointed out as she hugged Little Pencil. "For me, there's no better feelingthan leaming to love yourself and realizing how important you are," she stressed.Little Pencil gave a sheepish smile, all he needed was his mother's enlightening words.Never had he been proud of what he was and who he was. At last, he was ready to introducehimself to the world."Lam a pen. I make drawings pop outl" proclaimed someone from the family of pens."I am a crayon. I make these drawings colorfull" declared someone from the family ofcrayons."I am a pencil. I make those drawings happenl" asserted Little Pencil, who came from thefamily of pencilsNever had he been this prouder! ​​ ​</h2><br />

                            19. Enumeration is a rhetorical device used for listing details, or a process of mentioning words orphrases step by step. In fact, it is a type of amplification or division in which a subject is further distributedinto components or parts. Writers use enumeration to elucidate a topic, to make it understandable for thereaders. It also helps avoid ambiguity in the minds of the readers.By using enumeration, writers lay emphasis on certain ideas to elaborate them further. In fact,enumeration easily creates an impression on the minds of the readers. The details and listing make it easyfor them to convey the real message they want to impart. However, if there is no use of enumeration in atext, it might become difficult for the reader to get the true meanings of ideas.Directions: Complete the table below.1.

                            20. Previously, you were introduced and taught of what a personal pronoun is and how it’s
different from an indefinite pronoun. In this part of the module, you are again to learn more
about pronouns. These are the interrogative and relative pronouns. Again, let us continue
doing the activities here.
INTERROGATIVE AND RELATIVE PRONOUNS
Interrogative pronoun is in a question. It helps to ask about something.
Interrogative pronouns are, what, which, who, whom, and whose.
Examples:
● What on earth is that?
● What do you want for dinner?
● Which color do you prefer?
● Which seat would you lie?
● Who is going to take out the trash?
● Who was driving the car?
● Whom do you prefer to vote for?
● Whom do you live with?
● Whose sweater is that?
● Whose parents are those?
Relative pronoun introduces a clause, or part of a sentence, that describes a noun. The most
common relative pronouns are who, whom, whose, which, and that. Sometimes when and where
can be used as relative pronouns as well. Relative pronoun is placed directly after the noun it
modifies.
7
Examples:
● The driver, who ran the stop sign. was careless.
● The children, whom we love dearly, need better educations.
● I have a friend whose cat is adorable.
● The book, which is now out of print, has all the information you need.
● This is the book that everyone is talking about.
In each example above, the subject of the sentence is described by a relative clause (italicized).
As these clauses describe a noun, they are also known as adjective clauses, because they act
like adjectives in the sentence. Each clause is introduced by a relative pronoun (in bold).
Relative pronouns connect the description to the rest of the sentence in an orderly way.
In the first sentence, the relative pronoun who together with the other words, “who ran the stop
sign”
is a relative clause that describes the driver, thus, the clause is used as an adjective for it
describes the noun, driver.
The same with the second sentence, the relative pronoun whom with the other words, “whom we
love dearly”, as the relative clause and as an adjective clause describes the noun children. In
the third sentence, “whose cat is adorable” modifies the noun friend. In the fourth sentence,
“which is now out of print” modifies the noun book, and in the last sentence, “that everyone is
talking about describes the noun book.

Interrogative Pronouns
An interrogative pronoun is used in a question. It helps ask about something or someone.
The interrogative pronouns are: what, which, who, whom, and compound words ending
in “ever,” such as, whatever, whichever, whoever, and whomever.
Examples:
What on earth is that? Who ate the last fig Newton?
An interrogative pronoun may look like an interrogative adjective, but it is used differently
in a sentence: it acts as a pronoun, taking the place of a noun.
Indefinite Pronouns
An indefinite pronoun refers to an indefinite, or general, person or thing. Indefinite
pronouns include all, any, both, each, everyone, few, many, neither, none, nothing,
several, some, and somebody.
Examples:
Something smells good. Many like salsa with their chips.
An indefinite pronoun may look like an indefinite adjective, but it is used differently in a
sentence: it acts as a pronoun, taking the place of a noun.
Relative Pronouns
A relative pronoun introduces a clause, or part of a sentence, that describes a noun. The
relative pronouns are that, which, who, and whom.
Examples:
You should bring the book that you love most.
That introduces “you love most,” which describes the book.
Hector is a photographer who does great work.</h2><br />

Bryan, Cha and Dex to reveal that he was diagnosed with cancer and will soon be
dying with only seven weeks left to live. Because of the news that hit the family, the
Bonifacio siblings reunite and help
each other to spend their father's remaining days
with him. Even though, they have their personal issues and differences, they decide
to do this for their father. Everything goes well when they spend Sundays with their
father. They reminisce childhood and teenage memories. As they spend more time,
they get to know each other again. Each has his/her own problems which are
unknown to the other sibling. The eldest son, Allan, and the second son, Brian have a
talk about Brian's troubles.
One day, the father receives a call from his doctor stating that he made a
wrong diagnosis. The father does not reveal this to his kids until the truth is found out
by the eldest son. They have a talk, and the father explains why he decided not to tell
the truth. The eldest son, Allan, expresses his feelings about the whole situation and
convinces the father to reveal the truth in their next get-together. At the start of the
get-together, the youngest son, Dex, finds out about his sister's marital problems. The
whole family also finds out about Dex's troubles and have a confrontation with Brian.
Cha's problems are brought out in the open, too. In the process of all the
confrontation, their father's real condition is revealed, and this surprises Brian and Cha.
This creates an exchange of painful words against the siblings and unearthing of past
pains.
After a couple of days, Allan apologizes to Brian and they patch things up. They
both take the chance to apologize to Dex, as well. All three go to Cha's house to visit
her and check her situation. All four meet their father at their mother's grave and they
talk to their dad about how they appreciate his sacrifices for the family. They work out
their issues and resolve hurt emotions. The story ends with the revival of Allan's store,
fun activities, a dance showdown.

                            25. Read the essay in the box and do what is asked.Some people believe that everyone needs a college degree. Educationis important, but I don’t think a four-year university education is needed tobe successful in our society.Electricians, plumbers, and carpenters go through specialized trainingin their fields. They don’t need to be college graduates to do their work.Blue-collar workers are the backbones of our society. Where would we be ifno one took vocational training? Who would repair our cars and unclog oursinks? The college-educated professional won’t do it. Unskilled work isimportant too. Dishwashers and taxi drivers may not have even a highschool education, but many people rely on the services they provide.On the other hand, a practical education combined with college coursesin business administration might mean the difference between being anelectrician and owning a successful electrical contracting business. BillGates is a good example. He started building computers from kits when hewas in high school. He went to Harvard for a while, but he dropped out sothat he could pursue his own idea of creating an operating system forpersonal computers. He invented DOS (disk operating system) andfounded Microsoft.In conclusion, people should have a chance to receive the highestlevel of education that their potential and effort allow. It’s great to havesome college experience, because it exposes you to new people andideas, but it is not necessary for everyone to receive a four-year universityeducation.Source: Literature.
