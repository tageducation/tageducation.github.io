 3. The ability of a building to withstand the stress of an earthquake depends upon its type of construction, shape, mass distribution, and rigidity. Different combinations are used. To reduce stress, first, the building's ground floor must be flexible. One method is to support the ground floor with extremely rigid, hollow columns, while the rest of the building is supported by flexible columns located inside the hollow columns. A different method is to use rollers or rubber pads to separate the base columns from the ground, allowing the columns to shake parallel during an earthquake. Next, the outdoor walls should be made with stronger and more reinforced materials such as steel or reinforced concrete. Then, to help prevent collapsing, the roof should be made out of lightweight materials.</a>

Different combinations are used. To reduce stress,first, the building's ground floor must be flexible. One method is to support the ground floor withextremely rigid, hollow columns, while the rest of the building is supported by flexible columns locatedinside the hollow columns. A different method is to use rollers or rubber pads to separate the basecolumns from the ground, allowing the columns to shake parallel during an earthquake. Next, theoutdoor walls should be made with stronger and more reinforced materials such as steel or reinforcedconcrete. Then, to help prevent collapsing, the roof should be made out of light-weight materials. A. DescriptionB. Problem and Solution C. Cause and effect D. Compare and Contrast E.
