                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>FIVE TYPES OF ASSERTIVENESS</strong></p><p><strong>FIVE TYPES OF ASSERTIVENESSBasic </strong><strong>Assertion</strong></p><p><strong>1</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Basic assertion is a simple expression of your personal rights, beliefs, feelings, or opinions. Let’s look at a reasonably frequent example in peoples lives – being interrupted. If you are interrupted, you might say to the person “Excuse me, I’d like to finish what I’m saying.” Often, the other person will be unaware that they have interrupted or spoken over you, and this simple technique allows you to express your need simply and firmly.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>2</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>Empathic Assertion</strong></p><p><strong> </strong><strong>This is the acknowledgement of another person’s situation or feelings followed by a statement standing up for your rights. A person is less likely to become angry or defensive if you acknowledge and validate the emotion behind what they are saying. You might say something like – “I know you are feeling angry and frustrated while you wait for a response [this is the acknowledgement], I completely get why you would feel like that [this is the validation]. But, the best I can do is give you a ballpark estimate of how long it will take.” This is a particular skill I teach to couples during couples counselling – how to listen for the emotion in what a person is saying.</strong></p><p></p><p>3.Escalating Assertion</p><p>This is where you begin with an assertive response, however the other person (for whatever reason) fails to respond. You would then gradually escalate the assertion. That is, you would become increasingly firm without being aggressive. So turning back to the first example, if the person continues to interrupt you, you might say “I know what you have to say is important, but I really want to finish what I was saying”.</p><p></p><p><strong>4</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>I-Language Assertion</strong></p><p><strong>I-Language AssertionThis type of assertion is very effective during conflict, and it is a technique I specifically teach to couples to help them to manage conflict more effectively. It is made up of a number of very specific statements:</strong></p><p></p><p>5. Positive Assertion</p><p>For a lot of people, this final type of assertiveness can be the most difficult. It is about expressing positive feelings about yourself or someone else. Most people can feel uncomfortable ‘blowing their own trumpet’, but is has a wonderful impact on your self-esteem and is an important skill to master. Imagine a dad reviewing his day with his partner – “I know I’ve had some difficulty with disciplining in the past, but I did a really good job today.” Or someone talking to their boss – “I really feel I managed that complaint well.”</p><p>Or a parent talking to their child – “wow that was a really big feeling you had. It can be scary when you have big feelings like that can’t it? I am so proud of how you managed that right now.”</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Definition of Assertion</p><p>When someone makes a statement investing his strong belief in it, as if it is true, though it may not be, he is making an assertion. Assertion is a stylistic approach or technique involving a strong declaration, a forceful or confident and positive statement regarding a belief or a fact. Often, it is without proof or any support. Its purpose is to express ideas or feelings directly, for instance, “I have put my every effort to complete this task today.”</p><p></p><p>Basic Assertion</p><p>It is a simple and straightforward statement for expressing feelings, opinions, and beliefs</p><p></p><p>Emphatic Assertion</p><p>It conveys sympathy to someone, and usually has two parts: the first encompasses recognition of the feelings or situations of the other person, and the second is a statement that shows support for the other person’s viewpoint, feelings, or rights </p><p></p><p>Escalating Assertion</p><p>It occurs when someone is not able to give a response to a person’s basic assertions, and therefore that person becomes firm about him or her </p><p></p><p>Language Assertion</p><p>It involves the first person pronoun “I,” and is useful for expressing negative feelings. Nevertheless, it constructively lays emphasis on a person’s feelings of anger</p><p></p><p>hehe yan po Sana makatulong </p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>*Basic Assertion
</p><p>Simple expression of standing up for personal rights, beliefs, feelings or opinions.
</p><p>Example: When being interrupted, "Excuse me, I'd like to finish what I'm saying."
</p><p>Empathic Assertion
</p><p>Recognition of other person's situation or feelings followed by another statement standing up for speaker's
</p><p>rights.
</p><p>Example: "I know you are feeling angry and frustrated while you wait for a response. But, the best I can do is
</p><p>give you a ballpark estimate of how long It will take."
</p><p>Escalating Assertion
</p><p>Start with a "minimal" assertive response... Other fails to respond... Gradually escalate the assertion?--
</p><p>increasingly firm without being aggressive.
</p><p>Example: From the first example, "I know what you have to say is important but I really want to finish what I
</p><p>was saying." "I really want to finish before you begin to speak."
</p><p>Confrontive Assertion
</p><p>Describe what was to be done... Describe what actually occurred... Express what you want.t.
</p><p>Example: "I told you to complete the forms by November 15, and you agreed to do so. Now it is January 15 and
</p><p>you are telling me that you forgot the forms but you still expect to complete our business on time. What is it that
</p><p>you want me to do?"
</p><p>I-Language Assertion
</p><p>Description of behavior: "When you __________ ,"
</p><p>How it affects you life: "It affects __________ ,"
</p><p>Describe your feelings: "and I feel __________ ;"
</p><p>Describe your desire: "Therefore, I would like __________ ."
</p><p>Example: "When you shout the effect is I am unable to work with you and I feel angry. Therefore, I would like
</p><p>for you to stop shouting and tell me what you want."
</p><p>Positive Assertion
</p><p>Expressing positive feelings about yourself or someone else.
</p><p>Examples: "I'm glad you came back to see me." "I did a good job working with that upset student."
</p><p>Repeated Assertion
</p><p>Sometimes called "Broken Record." Opposite of escalation. Simple, calm, repetition--saying what you want
</p><p>over and over again, rote repetition.
</p><p>Example: "You said you would complete this form and there is missing information."...A sarcastic reply... "The
</p><p>form has not been completed." ...Another comment... "I have to have this form completed."
</p><p>Fogging Assertion
</p><p>Acknowledging possibility of truth to what other person is saying--agreeing in concept but not necessarily in
</p><p>fact. t.
</p><p>Example: "I know these rules may appear to make no sense, but they are the procedures I must use*</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>im sorry pero sana nakahelp ;)</p><br />

I-language assertion</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p>*  I-Language Assertion is a statement used to express the feeling and preference of the writer.
