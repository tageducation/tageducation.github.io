</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There are many casualties because of the lack of preparedness not just by the disaster group of Tacloban but all the people who has experienced Yolanda's wrath. There would be a notice from other government agencies and authorities, but the hurricane is too strong and people are not prepared enough when the hurricane hit the land mass of Tacloban. Also, the places where evacuees take shelter has been wiped out by the surge combined with strong winds and floodings. Families take refuge on churches and high places, but unfortunately all places has almost destroyed by forces of nature. It was really one of the worst disaster ever happened on earth.
