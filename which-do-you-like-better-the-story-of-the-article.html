Which one is easier to understand, is it the article or the film? Explain why please.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Medusa was a beautiful priestess of Athena, she was also described as a girl who had a long hair. She was punished because she broke the vow of  celibacy or she had an affair with the sea god, Poseidon.</p><p>2. Poseidon took advantage of Medusa, he tempted her to have an affair with her forcibly.</p><p>3. Athena was angry to Poseidon for taking advantage of Medusa, as she was her priestess and she must never break her vow which Medusa did.</p><p>4. Athena turned Medusa into a monster who has a hair of snakes, she is now a half snake and half woman and whoever man looks directly into her eyes will turn into stone or statue.</p><p>5. It was more like a punishment, Poseidon was the one who tempted her but didn't get punished for it, instead it was Medusa who was turned to be a monster and was haunted by heroes, knights and men as a trophy of victory.</p><p>6. I want to be horrifying but strong to be able to defend myself against whatever is coming for me. Being beautiful doesn't guarantee you safety especially these days where people are pretentious.</p><p>7.I like the story more.</p><p>8. I like the texts because it allows me to imagine and manipulate things just like how I want it to be.</p><p>9. The article, because it saves you a lot of time and you'll understand fully and it is very detailed. It is also very efficient if you want to gain extra knowledge and facts regarding the story.</p><p></p><p>pabrainliest po tysm</p><p></p><br />
