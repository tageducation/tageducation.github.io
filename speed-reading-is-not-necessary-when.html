1. Compound motion is the same as horizontal motion.
2. According to Galileo, an object thrown in the sea will sink because its
weight is less than the force acted on it by the water.
3. Vertical motion is highly influenced by gravity.
4. In nature, an object in horizontal motion will definitely stop moving at a
certain point and time.
5. According to Galileo, the speed of a falling object depends on its weight.
6. An external force is necessary to maintain an object’s horizontal motion.
7. Consider an infinitely long frictionless plane. When a ball is pushed to roll
on the plane, it will not stop moving unless a force is exerted on it.
8. Projectile motion is the combination of vertical and horizontal motions.
9. Projectiles do not follow a specific trajectory.
