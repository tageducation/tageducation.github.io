below. Then, write at least 2-3 sentences as an explanation to support your answer.
1. Solo travel will not only reveal colorful new heights, but it will also introduce you to yourself - your resiliency, your sense of adventure, and your independence. Learning how to travel solo is as intrinsic as tying your shoes, and it is something that can be learned today. The first, most obvious, way to travel solo successfully is to research your area. The number one indicator of a tourist is someone stopped in the middle of the sidewalk scanning the
GPS on their phone. According to World Travel News Report, four in fifteen tourists will be pickpocketed if they standstill on a busy street (Parker, 2019). Arrive well-informed on the area. Understand the public transportation system to the point where you can blend in as a local. Also, in line with safety, you may want to splurge on accommodations. You can stay alone in a hostel but read the reviews carefully. Make sure it is in a safe area and security is a priority for them. You might even want to consider a private room, some of which include a private bath. In terms of fun, pack for your lack of companionship. Bring a blank journal to record your
adventures. Pack a paperback to enjoy while you wait out a rainstorm in a coffee shop. World traveler Samantha Byrnes says, “I never travel with friends. When I’m exploring a new continent, my journal is my only sidekick” (Byrnes, 2018). This allows her to absorb her new surroundings, make new acquaintances, and focus on the act of encountering herself. Byrnes continues, “We lost sight of ourselves in the day-to-day. We
focus on work, family, to-do lists, and chores. Solo travel allows us to return to ourselves so that, when we resume our day-to-day activities, we can give our all” (Byrnes, 2018). Learning how to travel solo successfully is an achievable feat. You can stay safe if you remain knowledgeable about the area and choose your accommodations wisely. Beyond that, you can experience true transformation through the simple act of carrying a tattered old journal. What
do you say? Will you explore solo travel? Choose wisely, for it just might change your life forever.
3. The definition of climate states that the word “climate’ is used to refer to long-term periodic variations in the weather patterns that are observed over centuries. Ever since the Earth was created, it is going through many changes simultaneously, and this leads to climate change. Climate change happens cyclically, it started from a colder ice age, and at the very present,
it is much warmer than it was two million years ago. All these millions of life forms we see today on Earth are because of the non-stop energy received from the Sun, which is the ultimate source of energy, and is continuously fueling the weather system. To jot down a few notable changes, the world is experiencing arbitrary droughts, unexpected weather patterns, and sudden rainfall and snowfall, there is a constant fluctuation in the temperatures leading to disasters like a forest fire, and the weather is no longer predictable enough. The changes are random, and it is getting stressful day by day even to keep track of the changes occurring. These changes have drastically influenced human lives in both positive and negative ways.</a>

                                            B. THE BRAIN The brain is the center of the nervous system. It interprets stimuli and tells the body how to react. The brain has three major parts. The part that controls balance, coordination and muscle movement is called the cerebellum. It makes sure that the muscles work well together. For example, a gymnast is able to balance on a beam because of the cerebellum. The medulla is a long stem that connects the brain to the spinal cord. It tells one’s body to do things without thinking about them. Digesting food or breathing even while asleep are examples of these involuntary actions. On the other hand, there are actions that one decides to do. It is the largest part of the brain—the cerebrum—that is responsible for these voluntary movements. Without it, one will not be able to kick a ball or dance at all. The brain might seem small but it is so powerful as it controls one’s entire body. Questions 1. Which is the best description of the brain? a. It makes people intelligent. b. It keeps one’s body healthy. c. It helps everyone think well. d. It dictates how the body will react to stimuli. 2. In the sentence, “The brain interprets stimuli,” the meaning of interpret is a. assign roles b. recall facts c. discuss ideas d. make sense of 3. What will the brain likely tell you if you happen to hold on to something hot? a. “I wonder how hot it is.” b. “Don’t drop it!” c. “Hold tight!” d. “Let go!” 4. Which is an example of involuntary action? a. circulating blood all over the body b. punching one’s classmate c. clapping your hands d. tickling your friend 5. Which part of the brain connects to the spinal cord? a. the nerves b. the medulla c. the cerebrum d. the cerebellum 6. What is the function of the cerebellum? a. It sends messages to the cerebrum. b. It connects the medulla to the cerebrum. c. It controls balance and muscle movements. d. It tells the parts of the body how they should function. 7. When you want someone to think of the right answer, you might say, a. “Use your senses.” b. “Sharpen your cerebrum.” c. “Give your medulla a job.” d. “Let your cerebellum function.” 8.

Would you stand by and let it happen, take part in it, or try to stop it? Not many students think about this, and that’s part of the problem.‘Treat others the way you want to be treated.’ That’s the Golden Rule, and it should be followed in every aspect of your life. If someone was in a position to stop you from being bullied and did nothing, how would you feel? If you find that unacceptable, you must do everything you can to stop others from hurting people.When the victims see no way out, they may choose to tragically end their life, leaving more hurt behind for those who were unable to stop it. Canada has the third-highest teen suicide rate of all the industrialized nations, with 15 deaths per 100,000 people. Suicide is the second leading cause of death for people ages 10-24, behind motor vehicle accidents. A young person's deathis always a waste of life, so how many more lives must be wasted before something is done?Bullying is happening everywhere, even at your school. You may not see it, you may not know it is there, but it is happening, and it causes unimaginable pain to the victims. The only way to end bullying is to talk about it openly rather than making it a taboo issue. If someone is hurting another person, they will not stop unless someone (either a classmate or someone in authority) stands up for the victim and tells their tormentor to stop.

                            4. Identify the writing techniques used in the following informative essays
below. Then, write at least 2-3 sentences as an explanation to support your answer.
1. Solo travel will not only reveal colorful new heights, but it will also introduce you to yourself - your resiliency, your sense of adventure, and your independence. Learning how to travel solo is as intrinsic as tying your shoes, and it is something that can be learned today. The first, most obvious, way to travel solo successfully is to research your area. The number one indicator of a tourist is someone stopped in the middle of the sidewalk scanning the
GPS on their phone. According to World Travel News Report, four in fifteen tourists will be pickpocketed if they standstill on a busy street (Parker, 2019). Arrive well-informed on the area. Understand the public transportation system to the point where you can blend in as a local. Also, in line with safety, you may want to splurge on accommodations. You can stay alone in a hostel but read the reviews carefully. Make sure it is in a safe area and security is a priority for them. You might even want to consider a private room, some of which include a private bath. In terms of fun, pack for your lack of companionship. Bring a blank journal to record your
adventures. Pack a paperback to enjoy while you wait out a rainstorm in a coffee shop. World traveler Samantha Byrnes says, “I never travel with friends. When I’m exploring a new continent, my journal is my only sidekick” (Byrnes, 2018). This allows her to absorb her new surroundings, make new acquaintances, and focus on the act of encountering herself. Byrnes continues, “We lost sight of ourselves in the day-to-day. We
focus on work, family, to-do lists, and chores. Solo travel allows us to return to ourselves so that, when we resume our day-to-day activities, we can give our all” (Byrnes, 2018). Learning how to travel solo successfully is an achievable feat. You can stay safe if you remain knowledgeable about the area and choose your accommodations wisely. Beyond that, you can experience true transformation through the simple act of carrying a tattered old journal. What
do you say? Will you explore solo travel? Choose wisely, for it just might change your life forever.
3. The definition of climate states that the word “climate’ is used to refer to long-term periodic variations in the weather patterns that are observed over centuries. Ever since the Earth was created, it is going through many changes simultaneously, and this leads to climate change. Climate change happens cyclically, it started from a colder ice age, and at the very present,
it is much warmer than it was two million years ago. All these millions of life forms we see today on Earth are because of the non-stop energy received from the Sun, which is the ultimate source of energy, and is continuously fueling the weather system. To jot down a few notable changes, the world is experiencing arbitrary droughts, unexpected weather patterns, and sudden rainfall and snowfall, there is a constant fluctuation in the temperatures leading to disasters like a forest fire, and the weather is no longer predictable enough. The changes are random, and it is getting stressful day by day even to keep track of the changes occurring. These changes have drastically influenced human lives in both positive and negative ways.</h2><br />

                            13. B. THE BRAIN The brain is the center of the nervous system. It interprets stimuli and tells the body how to react. The brain has three major parts. The part that controls balance, coordination and muscle movement is called the cerebellum. It makes sure that the muscles work well together. For example, a gymnast is able to balance on a beam because of the cerebellum. The medulla is a long stem that connects the brain to the spinal cord. It tells one’s body to do things without thinking about them. Digesting food or breathing even while asleep are examples of these involuntary actions. On the other hand, there are actions that one decides to do. It is the largest part of the brain—the cerebrum—that is responsible for these voluntary movements. Without it, one will not be able to kick a ball or dance at all. The brain might seem small but it is so powerful as it controls one’s entire body. Questions 1. Which is the best description of the brain? a. It makes people intelligent. b. It keeps one’s body healthy. c. It helps everyone think well. d. It dictates how the body will react to stimuli. 2. In the sentence, “The brain interprets stimuli,” the meaning of interpret is a. assign roles b. recall facts c. discuss ideas d. make sense of 3. What will the brain likely tell you if you happen to hold on to something hot? a. “I wonder how hot it is.” b. “Don’t drop it!” c. “Hold tight!” d. “Let go!” 4. Which is an example of involuntary action? a. circulating blood all over the body b. punching one’s classmate c. clapping your hands d. tickling your friend 5. Which part of the brain connects to the spinal cord? a. the nerves b. the medulla c. the cerebrum d. the cerebellum 6. What is the function of the cerebellum? a. It sends messages to the cerebrum. b. It connects the medulla to the cerebrum. c. It controls balance and muscle movements. d. It tells the parts of the body how they should function. 7. When you want someone to think of the right answer, you might say, a. “Use your senses.” b. “Sharpen your cerebrum.” c. “Give your medulla a job.” d. “Let your cerebellum function.” 8. What is the main idea of the selection? a. The brain controls the senses. b. The brain interprets all actions. c. The brain has three main parts. d. The brain controls one’s entire body​</h2><br />

                            19. Bullying in SchoolBy Maria B.BostonIf you saw bullying, what would you do to stop it? Would you stand by and let it happen, take part in it, or try to stop it? Not many students think about this, and that’s part of the problem.‘Treat others the way you want to be treated.’ That’s the Golden Rule, and it should be followed in every aspect of your life. If someone was in a position to stop you from being bullied and did nothing, how would you feel? If you find that unacceptable, you must do everything you can to stop others from hurting people.When the victims see no way out, they may choose to tragically end their life, leaving more hurt behind for those who were unable to stop it. Canada has the third-highest teen suicide rate of all the industrialized nations, with 15 deaths per 100,000 people. Suicide is the second leading cause of death for people ages 10-24, behind motor vehicle accidents. A young person's deathis always a waste of life, so how many more lives must be wasted before something is done?Bullying is happening everywhere, even at your school. You may not see it, you may not know it is there, but it is happening, and it causes unimaginable pain to the victims. The only way to end bullying is to talk about it openly rather than making it a taboo issue. If someone is hurting another person, they will not stop unless someone (either a classmate or someone in authority) stands up for the victim and tells their tormentor to stop. Bullying is everyone’s problem; therefore, everyone has to be part of the solution.What are the opinion statements? Are they backed up with evidence orfactual information. If yes, prove your answer​​</h2><br />
                        Yes, they are real information to inform us that Bullying can affect everyone—those who are bullied, those who bully, and those who witness bullying. Bullying is linked to many negative outcomes including impacts on mental health, substance use, and suicide. It is important to talk to kids to determine whether bullying—or something else—is a concern.<br /><br />correct me if im wrong nlang;))<br />
