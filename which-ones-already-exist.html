                                            Directions: Below is another debate speech which talks of a certain topic or theme. Identify the ultimate theme and write it on the space provided. Mother Theresa once said, and I quote, “I only feel angry when I see waste,when I see people I throwing away things we could use," unquote. Friends, ladies and gentlemen, good day. Lawmakers are now pushing for the creation of the Department of Disaster Resilience and we, in the affirmative side firmly regret its creation. For this constructive speech, I will be discussing two arguments why it is not necessary to create the Department of Disaster Resilience under the provisions of House Bill No. 5989 which has already passed the third and final reading in the House of Representatives. For my first argument, the proposed creation of DDR fails to justify how it is different from existing institutions that already deal and are effective with disaster relief and response. Vice President Leni Robredo in fact convincingly stated that the government should look into the gaps in existing agencies instead of creating new ones that will create unnecessary layer in the bureaucracy when in fact existing state agencies are already performing its mandate. Furthermore, Albay Rep. Edcel Lagman reiterates that the Office of the Civil Defense, Social Welfare Development, Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG), and the Department of Public works and Highways (DPWH) among others are actively performing on disaster prevention, mitigation, management and rehabilitation.

Lawmakers are now pushing for the creation of the Department of Disaster Resilience and we, in the affirmative side firmly regret its creation. For this constructive speech, I will be discussing two arguments why it is not necessary to create the Department of Disaster Resilience under the provisions of House Bill No. 5989 which has already passed the third and final reading in the House of Representatives. For my first argument, the proposed creation of DDR fails to justify how it is different from existing institutions that already deal and are effective with disaster relief and response.
