                            14. how does location affect the location of a place brainly</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>A location is the place where a particular point or object exists. Location is an important term in geography, and is usually considered more precise than "place." A locality is a human settlement: city, town, village, or even archaeological site.<p></p>A place's absolute location is its exact place on Earth, often given in terms of latitude and longitude.<p></p>For example, the Empire State Building is located at 40.7 degrees north (latitude), 74 degrees west (longitude). It sits at the intersection of 33rd Street and Fifth Avenue in New York City, New York. That is the building’s absolute location.<p></p>Location can sometimes be expressed in relative terms. Relative location is a description of how a place is related to other places. For example, the Empire State Building is 365 kilometers (227 miles) north of the White House in Washington, D.C. It is also about 15 blocks from New York's Central Park. These are just two of the building's relative locations.<p></p>Relative location can help analyze how two places are connected, whether by distance, culture, or even technology. The city of Kiev, Ukraine, for example, is about 2,298 kilometers (1,428 miles) east of London, England. The U.S. cities of Key West, Florida, and Anchorage, Alaska, are even further apart—6,436 kilometers (3,999 miles). However, Floridians and Alaskans share the same language, national government, and geographic features. (They both have long ocean coasts subject to heavy storms, for instance.). Culturally, Ukraine and England are much further apart than Florida and Alaska: They speak different languages, have different government systems, and different geographic features. (Ukraine is landlocked, for instance, while England is part of the island nation of the United Kingdom.)<p></p>Directions like north, south, east, and west help describe where one place is in relation to another. The "Wild West" is a cultural location that vaguely refers to parts of the United States west of the Mississippi River. The Wild West, however, rarely includes the states of Alaska and Hawaii, the westernmost states in the nation.<p></p>Coordinates of longitude and latitude help pinpoint the absolute location of a person, place, or thing. Knowing a location is 0 degrees west (longitude) and 51 degrees north (latitude) tells you it’s probably near Greenwich, England, for instance. Knowing the location is 0 degrees west and 51 degrees, 28 minutes, and 40 seconds north tells you the location is the Royal Observatory, a building in Greenwich. At the Royal Observatory, directions like left, right, upstairs, and downstairs give visitors even more precise locations.<p></p>Even absolute location is a form of relative location! Coordinates simply give a place's position relative to the Equator (latitude) and prime meridian (longitude).<p></p>I hope it helps comrade  ✨ต^•w•^✨<p></p>#keep on learning<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.We have rich natural resources because we do care enough to our environment. and also we have a tropical climate which is needed by plants and animals to grow and we are located at the pacific ring of fire which it's an advantage for us because we may have lots of mineral resouces in our country</p><p>2.Geologic structures refer to things like mountains, rivers, lakes and ponds. They are the things that are natural. These structures are what gives a country its rich bounty of natural resources.</p><p>3.Yes. Our location near the equator is related to the presence of whatever natural resource you're talking</p><p>4.Our latitude position affects water,soil resources and biodiversity because our latitude places up just above the equator in Northern Hemisphere</p><p>5.Philippines is located which is prone to volcanoes, most prominent in the country is the occurence of geologic volcanoes, although sometimes volcanoes devastate us but a country which is prone to volcanoes may have a rich metallic deposit, some metallic deposits found in our country such as silvers,coppers,gold,lead and zinc are associated with hot molten materials or magma.
</p><p>
</p><p>these minerals can be found within the roots of extinct volcanoes.
</p><p>
</p><p>First, tthe hot molten materials or known as magma rises up and then passes on the surface and then will erupt and called as lava ,the lava solidifies to form a new different mineral and this mineral is called extrusive igneous rocks, which in beneath the volcano forms different kinds of crystalline rocks, themagma circulates all around within thus it solidifies and form different minerals.</p><p>6.As a nation located in the Pacific ring of fire, we have many volcanoes so we have geothermal too. Aside from that we have wind energy, solar energy and water energy resources too.</p><p>7.Re-planting lost resources is sustainable while mining for more oil is not</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>#  </p><br />
