For the second time, you have not gone to school face to face, instead, you faced your modules and answered them on your own without the guidance of your teacher. I tapped you on the back for getting through it. This year, I expect more challenges given the fact that lessons seem to be harder each week. I hope that I will be able to comply with all the school requirements. </p><p>           You have learned that you can only rely on yourself for you to understand the lessons in the modules, of course, to some people also who are generous enough to lend their time and knowledge in helping you understand your lessons. It's hard, isn't it? Don't worry, you have achieved your goals in passing your modules every week complete and not being late. </p><p>             Please be reminded that when making decisions, you should give them a thought and analyze the pros and cons of your actions and decisions. In achieving future goals, you should work hard fort them and never give up. Always pray to God for grace, protection, and mercy.</p><p></p><p>                                                                                             Yours truly,</p><p>                                                                                              Current Self</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Dear Future Self,</p><p></p><p>Kudos! You have survived another academic year despite the many challenges.</p><p></p><p>It was a tough year going through a battle of mental and physical stress. School year was not easy. There are a lot of happenings around us. Pandemic is not yet over, academic life has been harder compared to face-to-face classes. It is not the same two or three years ago. I cannot share my ideas with my friends in an instant. </p><p></p><p>I have learned that mental health is as important as physical health. With very limited gatherings and social life, my thinking has been affected. Sometimes, anxiety is sinking in my mind but I'm glad I overcome all the struggles. My friends and family have been my anchor to get back in life. And God, is the first to acknowledge above all.</p><p></p><p>Since the pandemic I understand how important is civic responsibility. Meaning, you need to consider the people around you. Just like wearing mask when getting out, it is now as important as taking your meal. While considering others, of course I need to prioritize my own happiness. In achieving my goals in life, I need not only to focus on the material things that I can get but also the value of true happiness. Also, family is always and will always be there.</p><p></p><p>Keep it up!</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>#BRAINLYFAST</strong></p><br />

                        <p>Challenges are stones that we have to step on and overcome for us to be better persons and to further prepare us for bigger roles in the future.  They serve as learning mechanisms for us to grow.  In order to overcome them, we have to learn to <strong>face them courageously</strong> first.  Fear should not limit our ability to be victorious over them.
</p><p>
</p><p>Facing our challenges can never be tough enough once we get to it.  It may seem that we are finally overcoming them until we find ourselves sulking over the sufferings and trials once again.  Overcoming is not possible if we do not break and hurt and lose for a while.  We overcome by <strong>constantly moving forward</strong> even if the steps are hard to see and grasp.
</p><p>
</p><p>We can never overcome our challenges if we let them break us and never bother to stand up once again.  It is in bravery and perseverance that we become victorious.  <strong>We do not give up, but we learn when to pause and rest.  We fight but then we also choose the right battles to fight for.
