                                            A teenager is troubled by pimples on her face. She tried different beauty products but her problem still persists. She searched for remedies online and she came across an advertisement that says "The face and body cream that you will surely love. Whitens the skins, removes pimples, decreases eye bags and prevents scar formation in just seven days! It has oil- control formula that leaves your face naturally radiant, smooth, and shine-free. It is hypo-allergenic and dermatologically tested to be mild even on sensitive skin." The product was put on sale and she immediately availed the buy one-take one promo. After using it for several days, in her dismay her pimples worsened and she noticed dark spots on her face. Questions: 1. What propaganda technique is used in the situation? What words or phrases do you think helped convince the customer to patronize the product?  2. In terms of language used, does the propaganda achieve its purpose? How? 3. Did the teenager make the right decision of immediately buying the product online? Why or why not? • If you were the customer, would you do the same thing as the teenager did in the situation? Why? 4. How have your knowledge about propaganda technique so far influence your decision-making in supporting ideas, buying products, and availing services?​</a>

                            5. A teenager is troubled by pimples on her face. She tried different beauty products but her problem still persists. She searched for remedies online and she came across an advertisement that says "The face and body cream that you will surely love. Whitens the skins, removes pimples, decreases eye bags and prevents scar formation in just seven days! It has oil- control formula that leaves your face naturally radiant, smooth, and shine-free. It is hypo-allergenic and dermatologically tested to be mild even on sensitive skin." The product was put on sale and she immediately availed the buy one-take one promo. After using it for several days, in her dismay her pimples worsened and she noticed dark spots on her face. Questions: 1. What propaganda technique is used in the situation? What words or phrases do you think helped convince the customer to patronize the product?  2. In terms of language used, does the propaganda achieve its purpose? How? 3. Did the teenager make the right decision of immediately buying the product online? Why or why not? • If you were the customer, would you do the same thing as the teenager did in the situation? Why? 4. How have your knowledge about propaganda technique so far influence your decision-making in supporting ideas, buying products, and availing services?​</h2><br />
                        The propaganda technique used in this situation is glittering generalities. The advertiser uses positive and appealing words and phrases, such as "whitens the skin," "removes pimples," "decreases eye bags," and "prevents scar formation" to convince the customer to buy the product. The advertiser also emphasizes that the product has an oil-control formula, is hypoallergenic, and dermatologically tested to be mild even on sensitive skin.<br />In terms of language used, the propaganda appears to have achieved its purpose of convincing the customer to buy the product. The advertiser used glittering generalities, which are designed to appeal to people's emotions and desires, rather than to their reason and logic. The advertiser used positive and appealing words and phrases to make the product seem like a miracle cure that can solve all of the teenager's skin problems in just seven days.<br />The teenager may not have made the right decision to immediately buy the product online without doing further research. The advertisement may have been misleading, and the product may not have been effective or safe for the teenager's skin. It is important to be cautious and do research before buying any product, especially those that make extraordinary claims.<br />The knowledge about propaganda techniques can help people become more critical and discerning consumers. Understanding the different propaganda techniques can help people identify when they are being manipulated and make more informed decisions. It can also help people avoid falling for false or misleading claims, and protect themselves from potential harm.<br />

                        <strong>What do you think make us free?</strong><strong></strong><p><strong>Freedom </strong>- the power or appropriate to act, talk, or think as one needs without deterrent or restriction.  </p><p>
</p><p>In view of that definition, it is confusing to imagine that your opportunity is given to you.  </p><p>
</p><p>How might you call yourself free on the off chance that you possibly went about all things considered when someone else said you were permitted to?  </p><p>
</p><p>Everybody is free, since opportunity is a characteristic state in creatures like us. It's in our inclination to decide for ourselves, to have an independent perspective, to represent ourselves.  </p><p>
</p><p>In light of this present, it's critical to not consider laws and principles as outright laws of nature, yet rather as just thoughts.  </p><p>
</p><p>Notwithstanding what the law says, I am allowed to go house to house taking everybody's TV. For what reason am I free to do that?  </p><p>
</p>Because I can.  Because I decide to.  <p>
</p><p>What other individuals (society and law requirement) do to me a short time later is essentially them utilizing THEIR opportunity of idea to have confidence in the cultural thoughts of robbery being terrible and not overstepping the law.  </p><p>
</p><p>It doesn't make a difference what the laws state, since laws are simply thoughts. There were a lot of inappropriate thoughts being repeated around during the 30s.
</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>Because individuals obliged them, do we consider them to be in effect right?  </p><p>
</p><p>An extraordinary model, however I trust you get the thought.

                        <p><strong>Here are some way to make us free:</strong></p><strong>Reduce worries</strong><p>Think less about what other people think of you. Other people are beyond your control, and if you can't stop worrying about your image in other people's eyes, you can't live freely. You can't make everyone happy, so thinking that you can make everyone happy can leave you feeling isolated and disappointed.</p><strong>Stop focusing on the bad.</strong><p>Be a free person by focusing on what you can do, not what you can't do. Turn your attention to what you can do to make things better for yourself and others. By doing this, you will find greater freedom to live the life you want to live.</p><strong>Be honest.</strong><p>Lies create a tangled thread of deceit that keeps you from living freely. Learn to be aware of the lies you tell yourself and others. Being sincere and honest puts you on good terms with people you can trust, because they can recognize the vulnerability in you.</p><strong>Do something out of the ordinary or spontaneous. </strong><p>Spontaneity is often lost as you enter the working life of adults, parenthood and social obligations. Obeying what society expects of adults to often squelch the opportunity to be free, to do something out of the ordinary. Bringing a little spontaneity and impulsivity back into your life can bring balance to your life.</p><p></p><p>Learn more about free at https://brainly.ph/question/12115852</p><p>#SPJ2</p><p></p><br />

                        <p>1) The absence of human coercion or restraint preventing one from choosing the alternatives one would wish.  </p><p>2) The absence of physical constraints in natural conditions which prevent one from achieving one’s chosen objectives.  
</p><p>3) The possession of the means or the power to achieve the objective one chooses of one’s own volition.</p><p></p><p>To be completely free, or to do something of your own free will, it is essential that you could have acted otherwise. If you cannot avoid acting in a particular way, then your action is not free. While it is generally understood that human beings have the ability to think and act freely as rational and moral agents, the common causal laws by which all human activities and responses are governed are incontestable. It is this conflict that provides the real problem of how we are free.
</p><p>
</p><p>It is hard to refute determinism in a world where almost all scientific disciplines depend on physical cause and effect. Scientific and philosophical views seem to object to the idea of indeterminism, and Hume’s compatibilism (we’re simultaneously both determined and free) does not seem to work either. Original agent causation through the power of the will is also no solution, offering only the even more difficult problem of mind and body dualism. With no clear answer, and only garrulous analytical disputation in sight, it is easy to see why the mainstream media redefines ‘freedom’.

                            27. A teenager is troubled by pimples on her face. She tried different beauty products but her problem still persists. She searched for remedies online and she came across an advertisement that says "The face and body cream that you will surely love. Whitens the skins, removes pimples, decreases eye bags and prevents scar formation in just seven days! It has oil-control formula that leaves your face naturally radiant, smooth, and shine-free. It is hypo-allergenic and dermatologically tested to be mild even on sensitive skin." The product was put on sale and she immediately availed the buy- one-take one promo. After using it for several days, in her dismay her pimples worsened and she noticed dark spots on her face. Guide Questions: • What propaganda technique is used in the situation? What words or phrases do you think helped convince the customer to patronize the product? In terms of language used, does the propaganda achieve its purpose? How? Did the teenager make the right decision of immediately buying the product online? Why or why not? If you were the customer, would you do the same thing as the teenager did in the situation? Why? • How have your knowledge about propaganda technique so far influence your decision-making in supporting ideas, buying products, and availing services?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>• The propaganda technique used in the situation is "Bandwagon". The advertisement uses persuasive language to convince the customer that everyone is using the product and it is the best solution for her problem. The words and phrases that helped convince the customer to patronize the product include "surely love", "removes pimples", "naturally radiant", "hypo-allergenic", and "dermatologically tested". The propaganda achieves its purpose by making the customer believe that the product is effective and has been tested by experts.</p><p></p><p>• The teenager did not make the right decision of immediately buying the product online. She did not do enough research about the product and relied solely on the advertisement. She should have checked the product's reviews or consulted a dermatologist before purchasing it.</p><p></p><p>• If I were the customer, I would not do the same thing as the teenager did in the situation. I would first research the product, read reviews, and consult with a dermatologist to ensure the product is safe and effective.</p><p></p><p>• Knowledge about propaganda.                                                                            </p><p></p><p></p><p>techniques can greatly influence our decision-making when it comes to supporting ideas, buying products, and availing services. Being aware of propaganda techniques helps us to identify when we are being manipulated or persuaded to believe something that may not necessarily be true. It enables us to be critical and discerning consumers, and make informed decisions based on facts and evidence rather than emotions or persuasive language. It is important to always do our own research and seek out multiple sources of information before making any decisions, especially those that can affect our health or well-being.</p><br />
