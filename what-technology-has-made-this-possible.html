                                            Directions: Read the short situation and answer the questions below. There is a mother and her preschool age boy sitting next to me. He has made a-sort-rocket out of his juice box. He says excitedly, "Look what I did with my juice box" not one, two or three...but six times (each louder than the first). The mother is texting. She looks up at him on his sixth attempt of connecting with her and she says "Um, yes, we will leave in 5 minutes." He crushes his rocket.

                                            WHO lauds PH's COVID-19 vaccination drive, suggests ways to improve (ARTICLE)
Metro Manila (CNN Philippines, August 25) — Two officials from the World Health Organization on Wednesday highlighted that the Philippines has vaccinated a significant number of vulnerable individuals, but they said there is room for improvement especially at a time when the more contagious Delta variant is spreading.
Dr. Takeshi Kasai, WHO Regional Director for the Western Pacific, said he was pleased to hear that at least 95% of healthcare workers in the country and close to 50% of elderly have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19.
"The government is putting significant effort in vaccinations," he said in a virtual media briefing.
WHO Essential Medicines and Health Technologies coordinator Dr. Socorro Escalante agreed, saying the Philippines has maximized its capacity to rapidly roll out the limited vaccine supply across the country.
"The vaccination rollout in the Philippines is going quite well," she said. "We have seen that they have a good plan of ensuring that when it is made available, they are distributed to the local government units as soon as possible."
The Philippines has fully vaccinated 13.19 million — or 17% of the target population to reach herd immunity — while 17.49 million have received their first dose.
Escalante noted that while several local governments are successfully carrying out their vaccination program, there are some that can still improve in vaccinating the priority sectors. She added local officials should continue to reach out to the remaining healthcare workers, senior citizens, and people with comorbidities who haven't received their shots yet.
WHO data showed as of August 24, the Philippines had the highest number of COVID-19 cases in the Western Pacific Region. It was also the country with the most number of infections recorded on that day, followed by Japan, Malaysia, and Vietnam.
The spread of the highly transmissible Delta variant, insufficient adherence to minimum public health standards, and difficulty in detecting asymptomatic or mild cases are among the reasons behind this, WHO officials said.
Kasai said the Delta variant, which is testing the public health capacity of all nations, is invading households.
"Delta's higher transmissibility means clusters of cases are quickly leading to bigger outbreaks especially in the high-risk settings... We are also seeing more clusters in families. Once the virus enters the household, more family members are quickly becoming infected," he said.

                        hey say technology dehumanizes us. But not everyone buys it. It changes us, granted, but does it strip us of what makes us human – that is, exercise our intellect? As onlookers of the food chain, humans have the luxurious ability to imagine and then create a tool for just about anything. So it would appear that technology not only doesn’t dehumanize us, it defines us.<br />

What technology has made this possible
<p>
</p><p></p><strong>Mobile phone technology</strong> makes the production and  growth of smartphones as well as likes possible.  <p>
</p>Mobile phones can be a way to create art and  have different features than just communication using specific <strong>mobile technology.</strong>  Various applications such as pixlr, pic collage and photo grid  are just some of these popular mobile phone photo editers.
<p>
</p>Tech dehumanizes us.  
But it's  not all bought.  It alters us, of course, but does it strip us from  what makes us human – that is, does it exercise our mind?  While consumers of the food chain, people have the  privilege of imagining and making a tool for almost everything.  But technology doesn't just dehumanize  us, it appears to characterize us.

                            9. Directions: Read the short situation and answer the questions below. There is a mother and her preschool age boy sitting next to me. He has made a-sort-rocket out of his juice box. He says excitedly, "Look what I did with my juice box" not one, two or three...but six times (each louder than the first). The mother is texting. She looks up at him on his sixth attempt of connecting with her and she says "Um, yes, we will leave in 5 minutes." He crushes his rocket. In psychological terms this lack of interaction is referred to as an empathic failure and will possibly have consequences. Children remain developmentally concrete for many years and cannot comprehend who their parent is communicating with or why. They just experience the disconnection and the fact that something they don't understand is coming in between thei relationship with their parent.....1. How could this seemingly attentive and undoubtedly loving mother create better technological boundaries to preserve her relationship with her child?​</h2><br />

                            13.  Independent Assessment 3Read the article below about TV viewing then answer the questions that follow. Write the answers in your answer sheet.The impact of prolonged TV viewing on young childrenTV viewing affects the language development of young children. It has a negative effect by delaying the language of a child. The opinion of most experts is that children under two years of age should not watch television.TV viewing causes obesity among children. It is most likely that longer TV viewing time results to inactivity. An average teenager sees commercials on fast food, junk food and sugary food. These two are the main reasons of obesity among young children as experts claim.TV viewing affects the child’s literacy. When someone watches television, it lessens the time that a student spends in reading. Research shows that there is a connection between reading and having a good test score.

                            15. WHO lauds PH's COVID-19 vaccination drive, suggests ways to improve (ARTICLE)
Metro Manila (CNN Philippines, August 25) — Two officials from the World Health Organization on Wednesday highlighted that the Philippines has vaccinated a significant number of vulnerable individuals, but they said there is room for improvement especially at a time when the more contagious Delta variant is spreading.
Dr. Takeshi Kasai, WHO Regional Director for the Western Pacific, said he was pleased to hear that at least 95% of healthcare workers in the country and close to 50% of elderly have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19.
"The government is putting significant effort in vaccinations," he said in a virtual media briefing.
WHO Essential Medicines and Health Technologies coordinator Dr. Socorro Escalante agreed, saying the Philippines has maximized its capacity to rapidly roll out the limited vaccine supply across the country.
"The vaccination rollout in the Philippines is going quite well," she said. "We have seen that they have a good plan of ensuring that when it is made available, they are distributed to the local government units as soon as possible."
The Philippines has fully vaccinated 13.19 million — or 17% of the target population to reach herd immunity — while 17.49 million have received their first dose.
Escalante noted that while several local governments are successfully carrying out their vaccination program, there are some that can still improve in vaccinating the priority sectors. She added local officials should continue to reach out to the remaining healthcare workers, senior citizens, and people with comorbidities who haven't received their shots yet.
WHO data showed as of August 24, the Philippines had the highest number of COVID-19 cases in the Western Pacific Region. It was also the country with the most number of infections recorded on that day, followed by Japan, Malaysia, and Vietnam.
The spread of the highly transmissible Delta variant, insufficient adherence to minimum public health standards, and difficulty in detecting asymptomatic or mild cases are among the reasons behind this, WHO officials said.
Kasai said the Delta variant, which is testing the public health capacity of all nations, is invading households.
"Delta's higher transmissibility means clusters of cases are quickly leading to bigger outbreaks especially in the high-risk settings... We are also seeing more clusters in families. Once the virus enters the household, more family members are quickly becoming infected," he said.
