                            1. autobiography for my teacher​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>As children, we absorb information and learn from experiences that mold us into who we are. Many individuals impact a child’s life, but the most powerful and influential role lies in a devoted teacher, a teacher provides growth to students as a gardener would to a garden of flowers. Each child can bloom into a thriving flower so long as you water their garden with optimism, love, patience, and guidance. Throughout my educationalexperiences I was lucky enough to have educators who poured their knowledge and optimism into me, and now I would like to reciprocate that back to students who are in the position I was once in. Balancing life and school is hard enough for a student, but a powerful and caring teacher can steer you in the right direction. In this autobiography you will read about my educational background, experiences that influenced my decision to become a teacher, and what I believe the role of a teacher should be in a student’s life. As a student I went to multiple schools, I went to three different elementary schools, two middle schools, and two high schools in Brownsville, and through it all I had great experiences. Brownsville is a humble community with low socioeconomic status, but rich in culture, history, and unity. In retrospect, the socioeconomic status was changing as I attended different schools, depending on the area of the school, of course. </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Hope it helps.</p><br />

                            2. Autobiography About my self</h2><br />
                        <p>The difference is that the character, setting, and plot are real and not imaginary. One example of literary nonfiction is the autobiography. An autobiography is the story of a person's life as told by that person. </p><br /><p>in short, an autobiography is about yourself. describe your life and stuff.</p><p>how to make an autobiography;</p><p>Write in the first person.

</p><p>Describe the setting. ...
</p><p>Transition from the introduction into your story. ...
</p><p>Tell your story. ...
</p><p>Conclude your story.</p><br /><p>example:</p><p>I was born and brought up in a nuclear family in Houston, Texas. We are a family of four: my parents, me and my younger brother. The school days offered me a lot to learn. Subjects like science, languages and history were of special interest to me. However, the mechanical process of learning never interested me.
</p><p>
</p><p>Although I was good at studies throughout my academic life, sports, music, drawing, craft-work, etc., interested me the most. I was more inclined towards understanding the concepts rather than just memorizing them. After graduating with a major in biology, I took up nature photography. It was a decision that changed the entire course of my life. Through this profession, I was able to explore life in its varied forms. Also the knowledge of biology came in handy while exploring the flora and fauna. In a sense, photography has proved to be a catalyst in this process of change which completely transformed me.
</p><p>
</p><p>My work as a nature photographer offers me immense satisfaction and great pleasure. Freezing the volatile moments with my camera teaches me how to deal with tricky situations in life. Working hard to pursue your goals and keeping a positive attitude are the qualities that help you when you are required to maintain a level-head in times of success and failure. These are the tools which help you overcome the toughest phases in life.
</p><p>
</p><p>Now that I am in a position to enjoy my work, I would like to and take up new photography projects and explore different regions of the world. I want to work hard and excel in photography.</p><br /><p>(hope this helped in any way c:)</p><br />

He was the son of a doctor and grew up in a family of professionals who instilled in him the values of education and hard work.</p><p></p><p>Arcellana completed his primary education at Legarda Elementary School and high school at the Manila High School. He then went on to attend the University of the Philippines, where he earned a degree in Liberal Arts in 1939. He also pursued postgraduate studies in Creative Writing at Stanford University in California, USA.</p><p></p><p>Arcellana's literary career began in the 1940s when he started publishing short stories, essays, and poems in local newspapers and literary journals.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>There is no single best way. The goal is to draw your readers in with your first sentence—to make them want to read more by telling them something about you that makes you and your life story irresistible.

</p><p>If you can do that, you’ve figured out how to start an autobiography.
</p><p>
</p><p>Before deciding how you’d like to open your autobiography, go back and review the purpose of the autobiography and consider what it must contain.

My grandfather has been a pastor at Selma Church of God for 39 years and my mom, along with my grandmother and aunts, run our churches worship team. One could only assume, I have spent much of my life in the church. From years of children 's church and Sunday school, I learned of God 's unconditional love for me and His constant willingness to forgive me of my sins. My family and teachers explained the crucifixion and resurrection of our Savior Jesus Christ. As a child, I knew all these things, these wonderful things about my God and my religion, but it was not until my early teens that I began to thirst for more.</p><p></p><p>At my church, one had to be in seventh grade to attend our youth group service. I could not wait to going into junior high so I could hang out with the teenagers and talk about actual teen issues and how The Bible tells us to handle them. The summer before seventh grade our church had new…show more content…</p><p>I was always lying to my parents, going out to parties, and staying at places I should not have been. My lifestyle was something I could not talk to my parents about, but I could confide in other friend 's parents or my youth pastors. I always wonder how different my teenage years would have been if my parents were more open and approachable about living life in God 's image. At home, we all knew of our faith and acted according, no cursing, no drinking, but we never specifically spoke of how difficult it can be to not fall into temptation. My parents were not understanding of any mistakes; it was, "you better not be doing those kinds of things," the end. This is not to say my parents are at fault for me being a rebellious teenager who lied to her parents and got drunk on the weekends because I was well aware of the sins I was committing and I attempted many times to</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Everyone who knows me calls me Jean. I grew up in a small town which has both mountains and sea. The town is just enough to support all of the residents' needs. I feel so lucky growing up in a place that has everything and I don't feel like going anywhere. It is the same way with all people I knew. When I was in High School, my mom got sick due to her progressive Parkinson's disorder. We had to leave the beach town and assimilate to the metro which I hated. I need to be reintroduced into a new circle of people. But we have to do this for our mother because there are no specialty doctors in our town. Due to looming hospital bills, we studied in a public school and it was scary because the students are rowdy unlike the private school we attended. I did not want to make friends with them. Day by day, we are running out of food. We had to buy our food everyday because weekly groceries are impossible. My older brother had to look for work to help us in the house. To make matters worst, we had to sell the little luxuries we have like our computers, tablets, and expensive stuffs. </p><p></p><p>To save money, I always skipped lunch. </p><p>One time, I was rushing to school that I forgot breakfast,  and so I did not eat breakfast and even skipped lunch. By 2 in the afternoon, mixed with hunger, difficulty of the math subject, and the heat, I almost fainted. My seatmate gave me water and was really concerned about me. She said that she can hear my stomach rumbling and asked me if I was hungry. Due to my pride, I said no. However, she went to her fried and asked for some extra food and lunch he did not consume during that lunch. </p><p>I ate it nonetheless. </p><p>The next day, I did not eat lunch again and so my seatmate and her friends game me one. I refused. </p><p>One time, I was really hungry and asked if I can have some food. I told them why I could not eat lunch. And so, everyday the whole class share a portion of their lunch and snacks for me. It really made me cry. It was like that until my mother got better when I am entering Senior High. Until now, I will never forget their kindness. I now appreciate that those who have less, give more. </p><p>All of us are still friends until college and help each  other with their woes. I am now studying Medicine to help people like my mom.</p><p></p><p>#BrainlyFast</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/19258525</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>I grew up in an upper-middle class family in a suburb of Los Angeles. My father earned his Ph.D. in electrical engineering from UCLA when I was five; my mom went to college part-time at CSUN, and finished her bachelor’s degree in English a few years later. Three of my four grandparents went to college. My paternal grandfather owned his own pharmacy; my maternal grandfather had a law degree, but was employed as a railroad worker. (My mom blamed the Depression for her father’s failure to find work as a lawyer).</p><p>￼</p><p>Photo: My father’s Ph.D. graduation, with me (left), and my brother (right)</p><p>My family lived in a nice single-family home with a swimming pool. However, my parents were always frugal. We never bought new cars until I finished high school, our vacations consisted almost entirely in camping, and my weekly allowance was $.05/per year of age (later I bargained for a raise to $.07/per year of age). Their fiscal restraint allowed my parents to invest in real estate, buying several homes as rental properties.</p><p>I went to public school for my entire K-12 education, with the exception of 4th grade, when my parents put me in a private Greek Orthodox school to avoid being bussed. I was always a good student, and fortunately, my elementary school offered ability tracking beginning in first or second grade, if I recall correctly. By junior high, I considered non-ability-tracked classes to be not only a waste of time, but very distressing. The “regular kids,” as I called them, were generally anti-intellectual and impulsive. There wasn’t much physical abuse, but there was a lot of emotional abuse, and the less I saw of the regular kids, the better.</p><p>Many readers will attribute my school performance and attitudes to my class background, but this is a deep mistake. True, virtually all of the students in my ability groups came from middle-class families. But most of the “regular kids” were middle class too, and I always saw my older brother, a mediocre student, as one of the regular kids. Furthermore, both of my parents discouraged my elitist attitudes, but I just ignored them.</p><p>My friends growing up all came from roughly the same social class as I did. The class background of my friends diversified only after I went to college. My best friend from my undergraduate days at UC Berkeley was the only son of immigrants from Latin America. My best friend from my time as a graduate student at Princeton came from a very poor family in the Poconos. But our class differences made no difference to us. Our common intellectual interests, values, and sense of humor were the glue of our friendship.</p><p>My childhood would have been much worse if I had grown up poor, but frankly, I doubt that my adult life would have been very different. As long as I had enough to eat, poverty per se wouldn’t have bothered me much. But based on my experience with non-ability-tracked classes, I would have been friendless and bored out of my mind. (These days, perhaps, I could have found solace on the internet at a public school or library). By the time I finished high school, though, there would probably have been plenty of scholarship money available for me. Even if there weren’t, I would have been fanatically motivated to put myself through college in order to escape from my origins.</p><p>You could say that growing up poor would have stifled my mental development, but I doubt it. Twin and adoption studies show that childhood environment has little or no long-run effect on IQ. You could say that growing up poor would have changed my attitudes. But I’m a difficult person to mould. I’m an atheist despite sixteen years of my mother’s Catholic indoctrination. If anything, I think that growing up poor would have made me more elitist than I already am, just as growing up Catholic made me more impious.</p><p>For my adult life to have been radically different, I would probably have needed to grow up in an absolutely poor family in the Third World, not a relatively poor family in the First World. My instinct in that situation would be to learn English and migrate to the U.S., but immigration restrictions would get in the way. This realization is part of the reason I have so much more sympathy for immigrants than I do for low-skilled Americans.</p><p>What if I had grown up rich? Again, I doubt it would have changed much. I would have gone to the Ivy League instead of UC Berkeley, but it’s not like Berkeley held me back. Perhaps I would have been less ambitious if I came from a rich family, but who knows?</p><p>From what I’ve seen, the standard function of class autobiography is to make middle- and upper-class authors feel guilty, and the lower- and working-class authors feel resentful. But reflecting on my class history doesn’t make me feel guilty. Rather, it confirms the common-sense view that in the long-run, differences in ability and character are the cause of class differences, and not the other way around.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p>*researched*</p><br />
