                                            Activity 2Directions: Read carefully each statement below. Write T in the line if you think a statement is TRUE Placeor F if you think the statement is FALSE.1. Truth is factual based, rather than oriented.2. If you lie about something, then what you are saying is false.3. Accuracy is a condition or quality of being true, correct, or exact; however, still welcomes, atleast, small mistakes.4. Whatever your view is on "truth" and the line between "fact" and "opinion" is a simple enoughidea.5. Other things we should consider in Determining the truth of any statement through Ideas andclaims are often presented in the form of Arguments.6. Truth lies at the heart of any inquiry.7. Fake news is news stories that are either completely untrue, or do not contain all the truth, witha view to deliberately misleading readers.8. The credibility of the website is unnecessary in finding the sources of information.9. The more likes a news item has, the more likely people are to believe that the news is true, andthe less likely they are to judge correctly if a news item is real or fake.10. Facts are generally established truths, easily verified, and do not easily change from onesituation to another.11. Relevance describes how the evidence relates to the claim.12. When evaluating an evidence, your first task is to analyze it.13. Fabrication has no factual basis but are published in the style of news articles to createlegitimacy.14. Truth matters, both to us as individuals and to society as a whole.15. Truth is the foundation for a fair and just society.​</a>

                        <p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>Defining Facts &amp; Opinions: A fact is a statement that is true and can be verified objectively, or proven. In other words, a fact is true and correct no matter what. An opinion, however, is a statement that holds an element of belief; it tells how someone feels. An opinion is not always true and cannot be proven.Globalization allows companies to find lower-cost ways to produce their products. It also increases global competition, which drives prices down and creates a larger variety of choices for consumers. Lowered costs help people in both developing and already-developed countries live better on less money.Some argue that globalization is a positive development as it will give rise to new industries and more jobs in developing countries. Others say globalization is negative in that it will force poorer countries of the world to do whatever the big developed countries tell them to do.<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. fact is a statement that can be proven true or false. An opinion is an expression of a person's feelings that cannot be proven. Opinions can be based on facts or emotions and sometimes they are meant to deliberately mislead others.</p><p></p><p>2. As a result, there are a number of positives associated with globalization: it creates greater opportunities for firms in less industrialized countries to tap into more and larger markets around the world. this can lead to more access to capital flows, technology, human capital, cheaper imports and larger export ...</p><p></p><p>3. Globalization made it easier for countries to establish multilateral relationships. It also made easier for reasearcher to build a knowledge interchange. In my humble opinion, though, it has seemingly helped more powerful nations to exert more power over developing countries, similar to colonialistic relationship.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Positives of Globalization</p><p>1. Developing countries get benefits from it through lead themselves towards economic success and ultimately achieve better standard of living as well.</p><p>2. It boosts the ongoing competition between countries all over the world as well as within any particular country.</p><p>3. Increased media coverage helps in drawing attention towards those parts of the world where human rights are violated for the benefit of the rich and powerful. This leads to improvement in human rights.</p><p>4. It increases exposure in the form of food, movies, art, music, clothing, culture, etc. This is a great way of forming closer bonds with the rest of the world.</p><p>5. It leads to a sense of competition in others; hence helping in keeping the prices of commodities under check during all times.</p><p>6. Developing countries can use existing technologies without the stress of developing any particular technology.</p><p>7. It helps in bringing different governments together so that they can work together towards achieving common goals; which is a great way of spreading global awareness regarding common concerns and issues.</p><p>Negatives of Globalization</p><p>1. It is widening the gap between the rich and poor; where rich people are becoming richer and poor are becoming poorer.</p><p>2. As a result of outsourcing, globalization may deprive an entire country of its jobs and resources. This is because globalization takes jobs away from one country and provides it to another country; hence leaving lots of people without the opportunities that they deserve.</p><p>3. Although people belonging to different cultures and countries get a chance to interact with each other, it causes a loss in tradition and values.</p><p>4. As species are deprived of their non- native ecosystems, there are increased chances of them spreading diseases and disrupting other natural ecosystems and their native species.</p><p>It is very important to strike balance between the positives and negatives of globalization so that balance can be restored in nature and its living species.</p><p></p><p></p><br />
