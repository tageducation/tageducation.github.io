                            1. What is the role you played in your family ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. FAMILY- As a youngest daughter, I always do my job as part of the family, doing good things. I didn't complain for the job assignment I had in home because my parents are the one who always supported me all the time. They also had their own role as my mother, father, or as my sister or brother. Doing and helping household chores will help to lessen up our parents difficulties everyday, doing good in school will motivate and give them strength despite of challenges they faced. Therefore as their child, we should also know our responsibility.</p><p></p><p>2. SCHOOL- As a student,I just didn't go to school without knowing my purpose, I go to school because I want to learn, gained more knowledge, be educated and getting my own degree someday. Having good grades and record will help us both as a student and to the teachers. A simple 'listening', doing your assignments or homework was a big help for both side, to the teachers, parents and you. Nothing's makes our parents and teachers happy, it is always our performance either we didn't get the higher grades as long as we did our job and responsiblities as a student. As a student, we should practice being productive and effectiveness of teaching, not just as for ourself but also for the better future of our nation.</p><p></p><p>3. COMMUNITY- Everyone has its own community they called. As a citizen and part of the community, we should be responsible for everything we did. If there are important news and information, we should also tell them because every little thing's does matter especially if they are disasters or vulnerabilities. Community is sometimes part of our life, we communicate and making interactions. A helping hands will be helpful for every family that lives in a community. There are many things that happened in our community. There are always that 'stand' the most in our community compare to others. Having a good relationship with our community and to the people will be advisable.</p><br />
