It looked empty, but you could always take out anything youwanted. There was only one thing you had to remember. Whenever you tooksomething out of it you had to put something else back in, although nobody knewwhy.One day, some thieves broke into the palace and stole the cupboard, "Now we canhave anything we want they said. One of the thieves said, "I want a large bag ofgold," and he opened the glass cupboard and got it. The other two did the same andthey too got exactly what they wanted. The thieves forgot one thing. Not one ofthem put anything back in the cupboard.They went on and on for weeks and months. At last, the leader of the thieves couldbear it no longer. He took a hammer and smashed the glass cupboard into a millionpieces, and then all three fell down dead.When the king returned home, he ordered his servants to search for the cupboard,When they found it, and the dead thieves, they filled sixty great carts with the goldand took it back to the king. He said, "If those thieves had only put something backinto the cupboard, they would be alive this day."He ordered his servants to collect all the pleces of glass and melt them down andmake them into a globe with all the countries of the world upon it, to remind himselfand others, to give back something in return when someone or something does orgives us something.PurpoFeElements of the story:CHARACTER:SETTING:​</a>

                                            What can I use as a title for this?
Back in the old days, being alone was fun because no one was going to bother you and you can do whatever you want. Also, you can focus on your studies but when I grew up, it changed me from being alone. I knew that it is dangerous because it is addicting once you see how peaceful it is like you do not want to deal with other people anymore. 
I want to elaborate on my statement that being alone is dangerous and addictive because based on my experience when I was the only child before my parents do not allow me to play outside they just let me play around the house, study, and sleep that’s all I do every day. So when I was in grade 1 my classmate was bullying me my teacher found out because I run towards her what she did was call our parent and let them know that his son was bullying me after that I sat inside the classroom alone I did what I did was reading books and dictionaries sometimes I also sat outside in a little house which we call the reading area. I hate talking to everyone when I started to experience bullying it’s not just that happens there’s a lot more reason why I do not want to talk to them even to my family and classmates but I like to talk with my cousins. I knew that when you have those experiences from being alone it’s so hard to give trust and get close to them that is why it is dangerous and addictive to be alone because all the people surround you have so many things to say and judge you even though I want to feel happy but I just want to avoid it but until I graduated from grade school I thought I’m not going to get bully again it happens many times that is why I just want to be alone forever.
When I started going to high school I observe all my classmates and I think they’re not like the people I met before grade school feels that I want to have friends now and get to know them so I give my trust to them and I started to like to be with my friends everywhere we go and do nothing to their house just having a food trip and karaoke. It is also started for becoming a rebel we are sometimes do not go to school we went to our friend’s house or go somewhere else and get drunk like if you get drunk I feel I’m the happiest person it makes me forget everything my problem, and for being alone because I have my friends but whenever I’m with them it’s like your being rebellious because you’re not listening to your family anymore it’s like you have your own world and alone again. My friends now are gone I have only one friend now which is not like my friends before she is giving me good advice and she made me realize what is better for me to do. Now I’m overthinking too much because I realize that all I do is regret all my past decisions. The fact that you are not living your life fully enough and for addicting, you cannot control or stop yourself from being alone and scared to be alone you are still going to find another way to not be alone if I did not control it maybe because it will become your habit.
To sum up, don’t be alone for a long time do not be scared to give trust and hang out with people around you because not all the people that you will get to know will not going to bully, a bad influence sometimes they’re people that will motivate you, cheer you up, accept you from who you are and loved you in deep. You should socialize explore everything try out new things, get out of your comfort zone, give your trust, and share your feelings or thoughts with your cousins because you can trust them so you will not be alone anymore.</a>

                            13. What can I use as a title for this?
Back in the old days, being alone was fun because no one was going to bother you and you can do whatever you want. Also, you can focus on your studies but when I grew up, it changed me from being alone. I knew that it is dangerous because it is addicting once you see how peaceful it is like you do not want to deal with other people anymore. 
I want to elaborate on my statement that being alone is dangerous and addictive because based on my experience when I was the only child before my parents do not allow me to play outside they just let me play around the house, study, and sleep that’s all I do every day. So when I was in grade 1 my classmate was bullying me my teacher found out because I run towards her what she did was call our parent and let them know that his son was bullying me after that I sat inside the classroom alone I did what I did was reading books and dictionaries sometimes I also sat outside in a little house which we call the reading area. I hate talking to everyone when I started to experience bullying it’s not just that happens there’s a lot more reason why I do not want to talk to them even to my family and classmates but I like to talk with my cousins. I knew that when you have those experiences from being alone it’s so hard to give trust and get close to them that is why it is dangerous and addictive to be alone because all the people surround you have so many things to say and judge you even though I want to feel happy but I just want to avoid it but until I graduated from grade school I thought I’m not going to get bully again it happens many times that is why I just want to be alone forever.
When I started going to high school I observe all my classmates and I think they’re not like the people I met before grade school feels that I want to have friends now and get to know them so I give my trust to them and I started to like to be with my friends everywhere we go and do nothing to their house just having a food trip and karaoke. It is also started for becoming a rebel we are sometimes do not go to school we went to our friend’s house or go somewhere else and get drunk like if you get drunk I feel I’m the happiest person it makes me forget everything my problem, and for being alone because I have my friends but whenever I’m with them it’s like your being rebellious because you’re not listening to your family anymore it’s like you have your own world and alone again. My friends now are gone I have only one friend now which is not like my friends before she is giving me good advice and she made me realize what is better for me to do. Now I’m overthinking too much because I realize that all I do is regret all my past decisions. The fact that you are not living your life fully enough and for addicting, you cannot control or stop yourself from being alone and scared to be alone you are still going to find another way to not be alone if I did not control it maybe because it will become your habit.
To sum up, don’t be alone for a long time do not be scared to give trust and hang out with people around you because not all the people that you will get to know will not going to bully, a bad influence sometimes they’re people that will motivate you, cheer you up, accept you from who you are and loved you in deep. You should socialize explore everything try out new things, get out of your comfort zone, give your trust, and share your feelings or thoughts with your cousins because you can trust them so you will not be alone anymore.</h2><br />
