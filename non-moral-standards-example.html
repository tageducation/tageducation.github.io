                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Morals: are formed out of a person's values. Values are the foundation of a person's ability to judge between right and wrong. Morals build on this to form specific, context-driven rules that govern a person's behavior. They're formed from a person's life experience and are subject to opinion.</p><p></p><p> non-moral: standards are standards of etiquette by which we judge manners as good or bad, standards we call the law by which we judge something as legal or illegal, and standards of aesthetics by which we judge art as good or rubbish.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Moral standards involve the rules people have about the kinds of actions they believe are morally right and wrong, as well as the values they place on the kinds of objects they believe are morally good and morally bad. Some ethicists equate moral standards with moral values and moral principles.
</p><p>  </p><p>Non-moral standards refer to rules that are unrelated to moral or ethical considerations. Either these standards are not necessarily linked to morality or by nature lack ethical sense. Basic examples of non-moral standards include rules of etiquette, fashion standards, rules in games, and various house rules.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.)Moral standards are those concerned with or relating to human behaviour , especially the distinction between good and bad behaviour. Moral standards involves the rules people have about the kinds of actions they believe are morally right and wrong.</p><p></p><p>2.)The moral standards thus derived are identified as (1) honesty in communication, (2) fair treatment, (3) special consideration, (4) fair competition, (5) organizational responsibility, (6) corporate social responsibility, and, (7) respect for law.</p><p></p><p>3.) Hence, moral standards are fair and just; and 5) moral standards are associated with special emotions (such as guilt and shame) and vocabulary (such as right, wrong, good, and bad). Non-moral standards refer to standards by which we judge what is good or bad and right or wrong in a non-moral way</p><br />

This means we must respect the lives of others, as well as ours. It should be noted that there are cases, such as in euthanasia, where this principle comes into conflict</p><p><strong>2) Be generous</strong></p><p>Generosity is a moral value that refers to the ability of humans to share what they have, not only material possessions but also immaterial aspects such as joy and optimism.</p><p></p><p><strong>2 BAD EVENTS:</strong></p><p><strong>1) Gambling</strong></p><p>Why is gambling called a moral lapse? Because the government clearly prohibits gambling. Apart from the government, religion also prohibits gambling. The love of money makes people want to continuously multiply the money they have in a short time, and that makes them slaves of money. When a person becomes a servant of money, he will do everything that he thinks is profitable. When someone already knows the "enjoyment" of gambling, it will make him addicted which will have a bad impact when he loses when gambling.</p><p><strong>2) Sexual harassment</strong></p><p>Compared to men, it is women who experience sexual harassment the most. This sexual deviation is controversial because some people think that when a woman does not wear clothes that invite crime then sexual harassment will not occur. On the other hand, there are also those who think that if a man already has the intention to commit sexual harassment, he will ignore those who wear closed clothes. So, who is right and who is wrong? Neither of them is wrong. However, everything comes from the mind and heart.
