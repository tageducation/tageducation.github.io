Do your best in everything to prevent any regrets. You could find an inspiration to motivate your will in achieving your goal. What's important is you must never give up and have faith and hope.</p><br />

                            2. What will i do to meet my goals</h2><br />
                        <strong>Goals</strong><p>Start by constructing a concrete plan which you will use as a reference or a guide through meeting your own goal. Then, pursue it and definitely move forward even though you will take a step backward.
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Goals </strong>are something we want to achieve either in a specific time frame or we just wanted to achieve it no matter the time and place. We see goals as finish lines where we get our victory due to our own effort and struggles. Emphasizing on the struggles since there is no straight road towards a bright future. We people make goals in order for us to keep track of what we really dream of achieving whether those are small or big things.
</p><p>Examples of <strong>Goals</strong>:
</p>Wanted to ace the test this year
We wish to be part of the creative department
We want to be one of the school newspaper editors
We want to earn enough money by the end of the year.
<p>We mostly hear goals in sports or in a business environment. A certain group intends to reach a certain goal after the game or after a project. These goals are things that they expect to gain and to be the result of their effort. Using assumptions as an advantage we predict certain acts that will either bring the team down or lead to our goal.
</p><p>There are types of goals that we mostly use or do:
</p>Outcome- we give ourselves a clear result but don’t say anything specific on how to get it
Performance- the result that we need to attain while using the process goals
Process-  the process itself, on reaching that certain goal
<p>Starting with the Process goal which is about stating the ways or steps that we need to do in order to meet the results we wanted or our goal. Next is the Performance the results are stated clearly therefore we act upon those results that we wanted in order for us to be compliant with that result. The last one is the outcome where the results are determined after we passed through the first two <strong>goals</strong>.
</p><p>There are also:
</p>Long term goals- where you decide on a goal that you will achieve for a long time
Short term goals- goals that can immediately be attained  <p></p><p>Learn More:  </p><p>Examples of Goals: https://brainly.ph/question/2129938

While you don't need a fashion degree to design clothes, it helps to have a fundamental knowledge of art, creation, and the fashion business to get you started as a clothing designer. Take sewing or pattern-making classes if you don't know how to physically create garments, or take a drawing class if you're unfamiliar with sketching or computer-aided design. Even classes in fashion history can contribute to your design inspiration. </p><p></p><p></p><p>3.Sketch your ideas. The first goal of a sketch is to begin visualizing the design in your head. The second goal of a sketch is to create a blueprint for the patternmaker to create your first muslin or prototype.</p><p></p><p></p><p>4.Hone your voice and signature style. You don’t have to stay within a particular style, as long as you make thoughtful creative decisions that aid your brand as a designer.</p><p></p><p></p><p>5.Build your collection. Creating a collection is not a linear journey. You can build a unified collection that presents a singular idea, or your collection can be composed of a variety of looks representing different ideas all connected by your design choices.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Explanation:</p><p>HAVE A GOOD DAY （＾∇＾）</p><br />

                        <p></p><p>[tex] \large \red{{⊱⋅ ──────────── ⋅⊰}}[/tex]</p>Belief<p> </p>Belief. The first step to goal setting is to have absolute belief and faith in the process. If you don’t believe you can absolutely transform your life and get what you want, then you might as well forget about goal setting and do something else. If you are in doubt, look around you. Everything you can see began as a thought. Make your thoughts turn into reality.<p></p><p></p>Visualize<p></p>Visualize what you want. Think of what you deeply desire in your life or where you want your company to be a year from now. What changes have to take place? What do you need to know or learn? What spiritual, emotional, personal, financial, social or physical properties need to be addressed? The clearer you are with each of these dimensions will bring your vision into sharp focus. The clearer you are, the easier it will be to focus on making it happen.<p></p><p></p><p></p>Get it down! <p></p>Get it down! Writing down your goals is key to success. By writing down your goals, you become a creator. Failure to write down your goals often means you will forget them or won’t focus on them. Have them written down where you can see them every day.<p></p><p></p>Purpose<p></p>Purpose. Knowing why you want to achieve your goals is powerful. Identifying the purpose of your goal helps you instantly recognize why you want that particular goal and whether it’s worth working toward. Knowing why you want something furnishes powerful motivation to see it through to the finish. After all, if the purpose of earning a million dollars is to put it in the bank for a rainy day, you probably won’t be as motivated as you will if you need it to pay for your child’s cancer treatment. <p></p><p></p>Commit<p></p>Commit. This might sound obvious to you but it’s a step that has disastrous consequences when it’s taken lightly. Write a few pages about why and how you are committing to each goal; why it’s important to you, what it means to you, why the outcome is necessary and what are you going to do to make it happen. Without strong commitment you aren’t likely to follow through.<p></p><p></p>Stay focused. <p></p>Stay focused. By focusing on your goals, you manifest. You may not know how you’ll reach your goals but when you make a daily practice of focus, they become easier to reach. Having your goals written down somewhere where you will see them each day is a good idea. Your mind will notice that there is a discrepancy between where you are now and where you want to be which will create pressure to change. If you lose focus you can always bring it back. Without a regular practice of focusing on your goals you may be distracted by something.<p></p><p></p>Plan of action<p></p>Plan of action. Being really clear about what you want, knowing your purpose, writing your goals down, committing to them, and staying focused gives you the power of clarity to write down a list of action steps. You may not know all the steps ahead of time but you will know the next steps that take you in that direction. Having goals without a plan of action is like trying to complete a complex project without a project plan. There is too much going on, it’s too disorganized, you miss deadlines and you don’t have priorities. Eventually you get frustrated and the project/goal fails or collapses under its own weight.<p></p><p></p>No time Like the present. <p></p>No Time Like the Present. To show how committed you are to your goals, think of something you can do right now that will get you moving toward fulfilling your goals. Even if it’s just making a phone call, do it now. You will be surprised how this simple step reinforces all the previous steps and gets you motivated and moving toward what you desire. If you are not motivated to do something right now, how are you going to get motivated tomorrow?<p></p><p></p>Accountability<p></p>Accountability. To push through when things get tough, you have to hold yourself accountable unless you bring in outside help like a coach who provides it for you. It makes sense to have someone beside yourself who can provide valuable feedback at critical junctures, like a friend or a mentor. Telling your friends and family about your goals may give you the accountability your need.<p></p><p></p>Review<p></p>Review. Make it part of your day to review your goals and take action. This keeps your goals alive and top of mind. It’s a good time to convert the over all plan into discrete action steps that you can take through out the week. It will also help you be aware if one goal feels stuck and you are over compensating on another goal.<p></p><p></p><p>By following these steps and practicing your goals each day, you have all the elements you need to succeed and achieve your goals. It isn’t always easy to push through. Some days will be easier than others but if you keep focused on your goals you will be amazed at the progress you will make. Remember, almost everything begins as a thought. You can be what you imagine if you follow these simple steps.</p><p></p><p>[tex] \large \blue{{⊱⋅ ──────────── ⋅⊰}}[/tex]</p>Hope it helps✨✨✨<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>goals + commitment = dreams come true</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>By having clear goals, you become aware of precisely what you want to achieve and how to go about doing it. You are able to more accurately assess and measure your ability to accomplish the goals and most importantly, you have a plan that can guide you along the way and keep you on track.</p><p>Add commitment and determination to your goals and you will find that you are willing to take continuous and consistent action toward making your dreams a reality, despite any obstacles in your path, including difficult times.</p><p>Having goals and staying committed to them will keep your focus on the things that you have identified as essential to reaching your desired outcomes.  Too often, we expend precious time on issues that have nothing to do with what we really want in our lives. We get distracted by focusing on what others are doing and achieving, and striving to do the same.</p><p>Having a vision and a supporting plan of what you want to achieve in life is necessary if you ever want to arrive at the correct destination.</p><p></p><p></p><p>HOPE IT HELPS </p><p></p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><p></p><br />
