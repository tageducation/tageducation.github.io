                                            .
In this lesson, we focused on sharing experiences and knowledge in
research. It is important to remember that:
• Research is a systematic inquiry to describe, explain, predict,
and control the observed phenomenon.
• Research allows a student to pursue interests, to learn
something new, to hone problem-solving skills and to challenge
one's self in new ways.
Reasons in conducting research includes: 1.) Gain hands-on
experience completing a research project; 2.) Work closely with
peers, other researchers and teachers; 3.)
Hone leadership and teamwork skills as you collaborate with
others; 4.) Learn valuable lessons for life and class; 5.) Gain a
deeper understanding of the scientific process; and 6.) Have the
opportunity to discover new knowledge and expand about what
you already know
Some purposes of research are: 1.) To advance some area of
scientific knowledge or to undercut some other area of scientific
knowledge; 2.) It is exciting, cool, or even beneficial for
humanity; 3.) Because you like the people in the community of
researchers and want to be with them; 4.) To get knowledge and
experience to be a better student; and 5.) To make a name in
school
Some of the benefits of research are: 1.) Enhances knowledge;
2.) Clarifies confusion; 3.) To have a proper understanding of the
subject; 4.) To learn about the methods and issues; 5.)
Understand the published work; 6.) Learn to create a balance
between collaborative and individual work; 7.) To know the
interest; 8.) To know how the original study originated; and 9.)
Understanding the rationale.

                        <p><strong>The Process of Sharing and Gaining the knowledge</strong></p><p></p><p>1.  The knowledge <strong>Sharing Process</strong> relies on a few key ingredients:
</p><p>•	Articulation: Defining what knowledge needs are present.
</p><p>•	Awareness: Knowing what knowledge is available and what is necessary.
</p><p>•	Access: Being able to get to the knowledge.
</p><p><strong>Knowledge sharing</strong> first begins with defining who the actors are. No, these aren't actors like you see on television, but rather the key players who possess the knowledge and those who need the <strong>knowledge</strong>.
</p><p>The next step is about identifying what the learning needs are. Are there processes and procedures that some actors have that others need to know? Where are the gaps in learning? What information is important to pass along or make available?
</p><p>Once you know the actors and the learning needs, it's time to identify where the key sources of information exist. Are they in manuals or written processes, or are they intuitive and/or known only to certain workers? Some knowledge is best retrieved through hands-on participation alongside the knowledge  </p><p></p><p>2. <strong>Gaining the Knowledge</strong></p><p>Knowledge is an <strong>accumulation</strong> of facts, <strong>principles</strong> and methods within the mind. <strong>Gaining</strong> knowledge is learning. You <strong>gain</strong> knowledge through paying attention, experience and being taught.</p><p></p><p>For more information visit this link: </p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/2633192</p><br />

                            9. .
In this lesson, we focused on sharing experiences and knowledge in
research. It is important to remember that:
• Research is a systematic inquiry to describe, explain, predict,
and control the observed phenomenon.
• Research allows a student to pursue interests, to learn
something new, to hone problem-solving skills and to challenge
one's self in new ways.
Reasons in conducting research includes: 1.) Gain hands-on
experience completing a research project; 2.) Work closely with
peers, other researchers and teachers; 3.)
Hone leadership and teamwork skills as you collaborate with
others; 4.) Learn valuable lessons for life and class; 5.) Gain a
deeper understanding of the scientific process; and 6.) Have the
opportunity to discover new knowledge and expand about what
you already know
Some purposes of research are: 1.) To advance some area of
scientific knowledge or to undercut some other area of scientific
knowledge; 2.) It is exciting, cool, or even beneficial for
humanity; 3.) Because you like the people in the community of
researchers and want to be with them; 4.) To get knowledge and
experience to be a better student; and 5.) To make a name in
school
Some of the benefits of research are: 1.) Enhances knowledge;
2.) Clarifies confusion; 3.) To have a proper understanding of the
subject; 4.) To learn about the methods and issues; 5.)
Understand the published work; 6.) Learn to create a balance
between collaborative and individual work; 7.) To know the
interest; 8.) To know how the original study originated; and 9.)
Understanding the rationale.
