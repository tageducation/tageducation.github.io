                                            Village Life
by Johannes Korop
Village Life So boring, so dull and isolated,
Very quiet, you feel uneasy
Meeting the same old faces.
When you ask,“Yu go we?”
They‟ll nod and say,
“Mi go wok”
The elders talking and smoking
At the corner of the singsing place
Ignoring you.
You‟ll feel as a lost ship on the ocean.
Life is so boring, so dull
And isolated.
One thing I wish for
The bright lights
1. Is the speaker in the poem young or old?
2. How does he or she feel about the village life?
3. What do the old people do to the speaker in the 
 poem?
4. Do the old people in the poem and the speaker 
 understand each other in the poem?
5. What do you think the speaker wanted to do at the 
 last part of the poem when he mentioned the bright 
 lights?</a>

(A Psalm of Life)</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The speaker says our life is full uncertainties. Everyday we experience differing situations, sometimes good and sometimes bad, sometimes happy, sometimes not, but life must keep moving on. </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>To explain further, the phrase/poem<strong> A Psalm of Life </strong>glorifies life and its possibilities. It is an invocation to the mankind to follow the path of righteousness, the right way to live this life. The poet, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow asks us not to waste our precious time and to make the most out of this short and transitory life.  Thus, it is only ignorance which is the inability of art of enjoyment. God created this world with happiness and misery. All we need to do is live our lives to the fullest rather than save ourselves for the afterlife, using the short time we have here on Earth as a gift. This is also a message for future generations to find work and action that gives them purpose and passion.</p><br />

                        1) What do you think would have happened had the traveler made a different choice?<p>In every decision in life, we'll encounter such a decision like this. As the question asked, just nóthing but with everything. The traveler chooses a path that he believed to finished. He doubted to be ever going back the way or the road he started to chose right back.</p>2) Does this choice influence his behavior in life? Why?<p>Yes, but some of us just don't count the way you choose, that's why they're trying to brag you about theirs.</p>3) How would you decide if you were in the same situation?<p>Just like him, choosing the way you believe and what you can finish.</p>4) Recall a time when you had to make a difficult decision. Do you think you made the right choice? Was the outcome favorable or not?<p>Yes, there is a time when my dad has a new credit card delivered to our house. I was 14 that year and don't even know a "credit card". I asked my father to let me see the card, then my little mind decided to use it online and purchase something. And that was the biggest mistáke I have ever done in my entire life, I purchased an amount of ₱20,000+. Two months later, my father asked me why is the bank contacting him saying, "You have a due of ₱28,000 ...", and I froze and don't know what to do. Ten months later, he got home from work and knowing what I did and he rebuked me. It was so tèrrifying and that day I learned a lesson, " do not be so ambitious in life, or you'll pay it in the future". Does the outcome favórable? Yes, because I learned from it. Also, no, because I wásted a lot of móney.</p><p></p>Learning Task 11) What is the moral conveyed in the poem? Is it explicit or implicit? Explain.<p>The moral conveyed in the poem is that "trust the way you believe". Well, as I read the poem, it is implicit. Because it explains what he decided or his choice in the poem.</p>2) What does the poem say about human nature when it comes to decision-making?<p>Do not let anything keep you from deciding what you believe, just continue what you started and you'll get the best result.</p>3) How does this poem remind you of the personal choices that you made before?<p>It is so mindful and it helps me aware of something that I decided to chose.</p>4) In your point of view, do you think the speaker in the poem is happy about his choice? Why or why not?<p>For me, yes, he chooses what he believes and thinks he can complete it.</p>5) What are the chances that the speaker will get to come back and try the other path?<p>It relies on the problems and situations. Every one of us has our decision-making problem. Am I right?</p><p></p><p><strong>#BrainliestBunch</strong></p><br />

Among these issues,what do you think he values the most? why do you say so?3.if you were him,how would you resolve the issue?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The issue about life that confronts the speaker in this song is his struggle towards unbelief. In fact, the composer of the song had admitted that the time he had written the lyrics of the song was also the time when he knew nothing about God. He never finds interest in knowing about God and considers himself an atheist. The song actually describes how Billy Joel have lived his life before when God have not entered his life. He said that it was like walking in a sleep in the middle of the night. Try to imagine how it was like walking in the middle of the night going nowhere. He had realized that something is missing during that time in his life. That "something" must have been faith. It must have been the faith that there is God. As part of realization he says that everyone of us end in the ocean, start in the streams, and were carried along by the river of dreams. This is the part where people are enjoying their lives and tend to forget their God that had provided them everything. That great enjoyment almost took them from their God but later they have realized that everything will just be as useless when they have lost their faith with God.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>yw!</p><br />

                            29. Village Life
by Johannes Korop
Village Life So boring, so dull and isolated,
Very quiet, you feel uneasy
Meeting the same old faces.
When you ask,“Yu go we?”
They‟ll nod and say,
“Mi go wok”
The elders talking and smoking
At the corner of the singsing place
Ignoring you.
You‟ll feel as a lost ship on the ocean.
Life is so boring, so dull
And isolated.
One thing I wish for
The bright lights
1. Is the speaker in the poem young or old?
2. How does he or she feel about the village life?
3. What do the old people do to the speaker in the 
 poem?
4. Do the old people in the poem and the speaker 
 understand each other in the poem?
5. What do you think the speaker wanted to do at the 
 last part of the poem when he mentioned the bright 
 lights?</h2><br />

                            30. Difference” by Shawn Desman 1. What issues about life are confronting the speaker in the song?2. Among these issues, what do you think he values the most? Why do you say so?3. If you were him? How would you resolve the issue?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.) The issue presented all throughout the song The river of dreams is more about finding himself. Something that he thought he lost and was solely driven to find the meaning of him searching for the undefined thing.</p><p>2.) I think he values his spiritual life but as he travels along he questioned his own faith maybe because of some problems, so when he says he is trying to cross the river but it is so wide meaning he doesn't fully understand that even with his faith he is still given the kind of problem that he think is to heavy for him</p><p>3.) If I were the speaker of the song "The River of Dreams", I would patiently and gladly resolve the issue in order to live a happy and doubtless life. The nothingness and uncertainties are only some of the issues that slowly kills the life a person is living especially if you can't even find out what and who are these. </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>#CARRY ON LEARNING PA BRAINLEST NADIN</p><br />
