                            10. Which component of projectile motion is constant?
a. Vertical component

b.Magnetic Force
d. Tension Force
3. At what angle should a water hose be aimed in order for the water to land with a
longest range?
a. 0°

4. Which of the following characterizes a projectile at its highest point?
a.Its velocity is zero.
b. Its velocity is maximum.
b. Its velocity is minimum.
d. Its velocity is decreasing.
5. In projectile motion, which component is affected by the force of gravity?
a. Horizontal component
c. Both
b. Vertical component
d. Neither horizontal nor the vertical</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>1. B. <p>     The horizontal velocity of a projectile is constant (a never changing in value), There is a vertical acceleration caused by gravity; its value is 9.8 m/s/s, down, The vertical velocity of a projectile changes by 9.8 m/s each second, The horizontal motion of a projectile is independent of its vertical motion.</p>2. C. <p>      gravity is caused by the Earth spinning. gravity affects things while they are falling but stops when they reach the ground. It does not operate on things that are moving upwards. gravity acts upwards on things that are moving upwards.</p>3. B. <p>       Ideally, the greatest range should be for water launched at a 45° angle.</p>4. A or B<p>     The maximum height of the projectile is when the projectile reaches zero vertical velocity. </p>5. B. <p>      A projectile is an object upon which the only force is gravity. Gravity acts to influence the vertical motion of the projectile, thus causing a vertical acceleration. The horizontal motion of the projectile is the result of the tendency of any object in motion to remain in motion at constant velocity.</p><br />
