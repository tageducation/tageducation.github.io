                                            POWER IN POWERLESSNESS The late former President Cory Aquino and her son Noynoy, at their Times Street residence in February 2006, heatedly debated her resolve to intercede during the Marine standoff at the then Fort Bonifacio. Noynoy, on whose lap fell the responsibility of looking after his mother after his father Ninoy was assassinated, was determined to keep her out of the fray, especially then when she was no longer president. Cory, however, remained obstinate as she unequivocally expressed her determination to proceed to Fort Bonifactio. Noynoy vehemently tried to dissuade her, citing grave danger and the volatility of the situation there. Furthermore, he wamed that those inside Fort Bonifacio were not exactly friendly forces and those outside were no less hostile than those besieged. But Cory stuck to her guns and declared, "Everything is simple. My duty is to avert bloodshed at all cost. Help me." Thus, Cory the ex-Commander-in-Chief prevailed upon Noynoy to escort her to Fort Bonifacio. Thre, the combatants seethed with anger. Calmly, Cory wedged herself between protagonists, pulled out her story, and began to pray. Before long, the simmering confrontation was miraculously defused. Cory Aquino, who fearlessly staked her life to effect peaceful change serenely rested on the power of the Almighty, truly realizing her own powerlessness. 1) Why was Cory insistent on Noynoy's accompanying her to Fort Bonifacio Why was Noynoy opposed to his mother's plea for him to bring her to Fort Bonifacio? 2) What was Cory's reason for intervening in the fray? 3) What kind of "armament" did she use to put her conviction to action? 4) What character trait/s did she reveal in this incident?5) Is the title appropriate for the model paragraph? Explain your answer. 6) What is the setting? 7) Who are the characters? 8) Whose person is characterized? 9) What is the writer's point of view used?​</a>

                            12. POWER IN POWERLESSNESS The late former President Cory Aquino and her son Noynoy, at their Times Street residence in February 2006, heatedly debated her resolve to intercede during the Marine standoff at the then Fort Bonifacio. Noynoy, on whose lap fell the responsibility of looking after his mother after his father Ninoy was assassinated, was determined to keep her out of the fray, especially then when she was no longer president. Cory, however, remained obstinate as she unequivocally expressed her determination to proceed to Fort Bonifactio. Noynoy vehemently tried to dissuade her, citing grave danger and the volatility of the situation there. Furthermore, he wamed that those inside Fort Bonifacio were not exactly friendly forces and those outside were no less hostile than those besieged. But Cory stuck to her guns and declared, "Everything is simple. My duty is to avert bloodshed at all cost. Help me." Thus, Cory the ex-Commander-in-Chief prevailed upon Noynoy to escort her to Fort Bonifacio. Thre, the combatants seethed with anger. Calmly, Cory wedged herself between protagonists, pulled out her story, and began to pray. Before long, the simmering confrontation was miraculously defused. Cory Aquino, who fearlessly staked her life to effect peaceful change serenely rested on the power of the Almighty, truly realizing her own powerlessness. 1) Why was Cory insistent on Noynoy's accompanying her to Fort Bonifacio Why was Noynoy opposed to his mother's plea for him to bring her to Fort Bonifacio? 2) What was Cory's reason for intervening in the fray? 3) What kind of "armament" did she use to put her conviction to action? 4) What character trait/s did she reveal in this incident?5) Is the title appropriate for the model paragraph? Explain your answer. 6) What is the setting? 7) Who are the characters? 8) Whose person is characterized? 9) What is the writer's point of view used?​</h2><br />
