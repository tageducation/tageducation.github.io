                            3. What is the irony in the story THE TAXIMAN STORY?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>The taxi man's story</strong> is about a Singaporean taxi driver telling a story to his passenger, who we could assume as a female office worker.<strong> The taxi man </strong>talks<strong> </strong>to his passenger about his life as a taxi man, where he had been driving the taxi for 20 years and how Singapore had changed so much over time. He told the passenger then, 20 years ago, Singapore was not this busy and it was much more peaceful and quiet in Singapore, unlike today, where people and vehicles fill the streets. He also said that he must work hard by driving the taxi every day, since, he did not have proper education and no capital for business.  
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>The taxi man</strong> stated that he must sweat a lot, so he could support his family. It was due to the fact that his family was large, having eight children - six sons and 2 daughters, because back then family planning was not yet introduced to Singapore. On the other hand, he is very thankful because most of his children are professionals now. One is a businessman, two of them are working as clerks, one of them teaching in a primary school, one working in the National service, probably the government, one still studying and his eldest daughter, who is at home, helping his wife. <strong>The taxi man </strong>then complained about the teenagers of today, wearing make-up, flirting with other men, partying, drinking liquor, and selling their bodies to foreign tourists. As he stated, there are times where students, together with their foreign boyfriends would hail his cab and would ask him to drop them off in various hotels, sometimes, they make love inside his car, it makes him angry and disgusted but they pay him high and sometimes tip him.  
</p><p>
</p><p>After that, he told the passenger about his youngest daughter, who was still studying. How she was an honor student and a bright and kind child. Until he found out what she was up to. She was doing the kind of stuff that his father hates from the youth of today. He told the passenger that he dragged her daughter home and beat her up, he then locked her in the room, to discipline her.
</p><p>
</p><p>The story ends with the<strong> Taxi man</strong> dropping off his passenger as he is in a hurry to pick-up passengers from the hotel who are mostly students.
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>The irony in the story of The Taxi man's Story </strong>perfectly describes Friedrich Nietzsche's quote from his book ''The Leviathan'', "If you gaze long into an abyss, the abyss also gazes into you''. He loved what he hated, that is the irony of the story. The <strong>taxi</strong> man hates the youth yet he makes money from them, by providing them with service. Picking them up in hotels, dropping them off, and even allowing them to make love inside his cab, just because they pay him a hefty amount of cash. In short, the <strong>Taxi man</strong> is a hypocrite.

I did some reasearch, and I found out it was hippopotomonstro sesquipedia liophobia. Arrrgh!<p>Irony is the use of words whose meaning is the opposite of what is really meant by the person saying or writing.</p><p>An example of an irony story is THE NECKLACE</p><p>It is a story of a woman who wanted to look like a rich lady during a party she then borrowed a necklace but the necklace was lost, so she and her husband borrowed money to replace the lost necklace and spent ten years of hardwork to pay back the money that was lent. after ten years, it happened that the lady met the owner of the necklace it was only then she told her about the lost necklace it was only then she was told that the necklace was a fake.</p><p>

</p><p>The
situational irony 0f the story is that he readers and and the lady did not expect for the necklace to be
fake. Also, the  desire to be rich. But
because of the kady's desire to be rich or to seem rich, they end up actually
becoming poor.</p><p>

                            14. What are the verbal irony are there in the story “The World is an Apple”</h2><br />
                        Setting/sIn the small and poor home behind a portion of the Intramuros walls. There are two wooden boxes on either side of the doorway. At left is an Acacia tree with a wooden bench under it. It is where the poor family lived in, and where the story starts on how life was going on and end in the complexity of life in which the main character lived with no choice but to go back again with his old ways of life. Character AnalysisMario- He is the Father of the story, the husband of Gloria. He is known to be bad before but he strive hard to change his life for her daughter and for her wife, but life sometimes is unfair that force him with no choice to go back the old way of his life.Gloria- She is the wife of Mario. The very good and lovable woman who just want a simple life yet descent life. She is the reason why Mario changed because of her unconditional love to him.Pablo- The evil man in the story, the protagonist, the old friend of Mario. He wants easy and dishonest money, the life that Mario lived before.PlotThis is a story of how wrong decisions become greater burdens to a family. Mario’s family happens to be in the lower bracket of society. When Mario got home, Gloria saw Mario and she was asking for some money to feed their children to Mario. Mario said that he have no money because he did something.Gloria didn’t believe on what Mario said and said to tell the truth. When Mario answered it, Gloria was shocked on what she heard because Mario lost his job. Gloria asked Mario if how he lost his job and Mario answered it and Gloria was shocked again because Mario said that he lost his job because of an apple.Gloria said that how can he lose his job by just taking one not a dozen not a crate but one apple and Mario answered that he just saw it rolling and he found himself putting it in his bag because Tita would love to have it, and Mario told Gloria that there’s no need to worry because he found a new job.Suddenly Pablo was there ruining the whole conversation and asked them if how is there daughter doing and he’ll loan a few pesos to help their daughter and Gloria said that no thank you because Mario stopped depending on Pablo. Pablo said that Mario’s new job was with Pablo. When Gloria heard it he told Mario that it’s a bad doing and risky.Mario didn’t listen and walks away with Pablo and told Gloria not to worry because he will come back early morning and don’t wait for him. Gloria cries and shouting Mario, while Tita was crying also because he heard the conversation.Theme:The one-word prevailing message in the story is the word “Apple” that symbolizes temptation and the dishonest life lived by Mario before. The theme of the story is, it is man’s basic instinct that drives him towards his survival. But, no matter what he should not forget that society expects him to confirm to its norms. One’s action is weighed right or wrong and thus should be kept towards the proper action and his wrong decisions become greater burdens to a family that symbolizes the word “Apple”.ToneThe mood of the story is serious. It tackles many aspects of human flaws and what is wrong in the culture. The story is sometimes sad but in the end, there’s a glimpse of hopefulness even though it is in vain.POVThe author used the Imagery and symbolic type of narration:Mario: Why? Did God create apple trees to bear fruit for the rich alone? Didn’t He create the whole world for everyone? That’s why I tried to bring the apple home for Tita. When we brought her into this world, we promised her everything. She has the right to have everything in life.Gloria: So, for just an apple, you lost a job you need so much?Advertisements<p></p><p></p><br />

                            23. What is the irony in the story of The Taxi man's Story?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>The taxi man's story</strong> is about a Singaporean taxi driver telling a story to his passenger, who we could assume as a female office worker. <strong>The taxi man </strong>talks to his passenger about his life as a taxi man, where he had been driving the taxi for 20 years and how Singapore had changed so much over time. He told the passenger then, 20 years ago, Singapore was not this busy and it was much more peaceful and quiet in Singapore, unlike today, where people and vehicles fill the streets. He also said that he must work hard by driving the taxi every day, since, he did not have proper education and no capital for business.  </p><p>
</p><p><strong>The taxi man</strong> stated that he must sweat a lot, so he could support his family. It was due to the fact that his family was large, having eight children - six sons and 2 daughters, because back then family planning was not yet introduced to Singapore. On the other hand, he is very thankful because most of his children are professionals now. One is a businessman, two of them are working as clerks, one of them teaching in a primary school, one working in the National service, probably the government, one still studying and his eldest daughter, who is at home, helping his wife. <strong>The taxi man</strong> then complained about the teenagers of today, wearing make-up, flirting with other men, partying, drinking liquor, and selling their bodies to foreign tourists. As he stated, there are times where students, together with their foreign boyfriends would hail his cab and would ask him to drop them off in various hotels, sometimes, they make love inside his car, it makes him angry and disgusted but they pay him high and sometimes tip him.  </p><p>
</p><p>After that, he told the passenger about his youngest daughter, who was still studying. How she was an honor student and a bright and kind child. Until he found out what she was up to. She was doing the kind of stuff that his father hates from the youth of today. He told the passenger that he dragged her daughter home and beat her up, he then locked her in the room, to discipline her.
</p><p>
</p><p>The story ends with the <strong>Taxi man</strong> dropping off his passenger as he is in a hurry to pick-up passengers from the hotel who are mostly students.
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>The irony in the story of The Taxi man's Story</strong> perfectly describes Friedrich Nietzsche's quote from his book ''The Leviathan'', "If you gaze long into an abyss, the abyss also gazes into you''. He loved what he hated, that is the irony of the story. The <strong>taxi </strong>man hates the youth yet he makes money from them, by providing them with service. Picking them up in hotels, dropping them off, and even allowing them to make love inside his cab, just because they pay him a hefty amount of cash. In short, the <strong>Taxi man </strong>is a hypocrite. </p><p>For more related topics and information about the <strong>Taxi man's story</strong>, please check out these links:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/437619</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/994142</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/1800862</p><br />
