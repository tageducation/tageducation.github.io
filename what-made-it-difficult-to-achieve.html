Choose the right term from the pool of answers and write the letter of your choice on your answer sheet First two answers are already provided. "TRESPASSING COULD COST YOU MORE THAN A $200 FINE. STAY OF THE TRACKS"-poster1. high-angled shot2. colours 3. symbolic 4. pun 5. slogan 6.image 7. framing 8. language 9. font 10. frame 11. side lighting 12. "penalty" 13. composition 14. Gaze 15. salient -numbers 1 to 15 are the choicesslogan In this poster we are presented with a highly emotive black and white 1.imageol a young man holding towards the camera his right arm, which has been amputated below the elbow. Below the photograph, on a contrasting orange, red and yellow background is a pun "Trespassing could cost you more than a $200 fine.' At the foot of the poster the crossed railway tracks become a symbolic cross, signifying death, and together with the imperative Stay off the tracks, and slogan "There's no good reason for you to be on the tracks. The penalty is $200 or your life' bring across a strong message for the Transperth and Public Transport Authority WA railway campaign.The oblique, slightly 2.___high-angled shot focuses on es faci expression, but the stump is more satient by being deliberately placed closest to the viewer. His face, un smiling, is lit by 3.___and surrounded by shadow. His nakedness suggests vulnerability but his facial expression could also suggest that he is accepting of the loss and feel comfortable enough to display it to a wider audience. He is not looking at the viewer, but away into the distance-an uverted Gaze. This allows the4.___ to be non-confrontational - as the viewer we are able to look at liis injury with curiosity or pity or whatever emotions we feel and noticel guilty for judging bi or examining the stump closely. There is a sense of Direct Chaze as he wants 18 to look all his urn. The shadow is in subtle 5.___around the vicum By viewing the person, not just the amputation, it is more real, more human and we realize that accidents like this do happen. The bright omnge, red and yellow6.___of thic background provide contrast to the photograph above, but they also add weight to achieve balance willing the poster The 7.___of the poster relies on the golden rectangle or the golden ratio that is visually or aesthetically pleasing The photograph, although smaller than the much larger contrasting section is chic more 8.___ in terms of the composition. The emphasis and unpact lic with the photograph. The colors are 9.___of langer and there is deliberate 10.___ with the red-orange around the care of the yellow center. The yellow, usually associated with happiness, draws attention to the symbolic railway cross at its heart. The use of space between the pan and the cross helps the viewer to glean several messages from the poster. The bold black capitalized font of the 11___is centered. The use of the capitalized 12.___which is more difficult to read than lower case, makes us concentrate on what the punis saying, as we make links to the image above The 13.___devices used in the poster are clear in their message.The pun is less direct than other examples of language used as it requires some thinking and linking between the image and language. The two meanings of cost' refer to a financial cost of $200 but more importantly, the physical and emotional impact of the loss of a limb or (as another link is made to the symbolic railway cross) ultimately the loss of life. The use of the personal pronoun "you" directly targets the viewer and the imperative commands the vicwer to "Stay of the tracks' The 14.___ while having a colloquial lone, reiterates the ultimatum to the viewer, with "The penalty is $200 or your life" The use of 15.___ here seems almost an understatement when referring to the loss of life.uhm i will accept 2 dares sa magsagot ng matino, thanks. ​</a>

Graduates have shared that deciding on the strand/track to take is just the beginning of creating choices. As we move to the next level, more critical choices are made.

These exits include higher education, middle level skills development, entrepreneurship, and employment. The decisions and choices to be made would rely on numerous factors like the resources and priorities. Senior high school may not be not college yet and not junior high school, but it is the important period in choosing the right path. - Cindy Sicat, Eastern Porac NHS1.

                                            Barangay Delikado is an urban Barangay with 750 families. Most of the families are informal settlers who belong to the low-income group. Most of them work as vendors, jeepney and tricycle drivers, carpenters, government employees, and salespeople in a nearby mall. The community is accessible to main thoroughfares and services. 
Two rivers transverse through the community, causing flooding every time they overflow. The flood reaches the second floor of houses during heavy rains. 
The houses are usually of semi-light materials such as wood and iron sheets of roofing. Two fires occurred in the community last year, affecting a total of 60 families. The place is dense, and the alleys that lead to the main road are very narrow (almost 1.5 meters wide only), which made it difficult for firefighters to reach the area. 
The barangay officials are active but they do not agree on what development program to implement in her community. One-third of the committee members would like to accept the offer of the government to be relocated to a place about 30 kilometers away. On the other hand, the remaining officials resist the idea of relocation and insist that they should remain in the area. The people are also confused about what should be done. 
What are the disaster risks faces by the people in Brgy. Delikado? 
What do you think should be the goals of the community? 
What strategies can be adopted to achieve these aspects?</a>

Choose the right term from the pool of answers and write the letter of your choice on your answer sheet First two answers are already provided. "TRESPASSING COULD COST YOU MORE THAN A $200 FINE. STAY OF THE TRACKS"-poster1. high-angled shot2. colours 3. symbolic 4. pun 5. slogan 6.image 7. framing 8. language 9. font 10. frame 11. side lighting 12. "penalty" 13. composition 14. Gaze 15. salient -numbers 1 to 15 are the choicesslogan In this poster we are presented with a highly emotive black and white 1.imageol a young man holding towards the camera his right arm, which has been amputated below the elbow. Below the photograph, on a contrasting orange, red and yellow background is a pun "Trespassing could cost you more than a $200 fine.' At the foot of the poster the crossed railway tracks become a symbolic cross, signifying death, and together with the imperative Stay off the tracks, and slogan "There's no good reason for you to be on the tracks. The penalty is $200 or your life' bring across a strong message for the Transperth and Public Transport Authority WA railway campaign.The oblique, slightly 2.___high-angled shot focuses on es faci expression, but the stump is more satient by being deliberately placed closest to the viewer. His face, un smiling, is lit by 3.___and surrounded by shadow. His nakedness suggests vulnerability but his facial expression could also suggest that he is accepting of the loss and feel comfortable enough to display it to a wider audience. He is not looking at the viewer, but away into the distance-an uverted Gaze. This allows the4.___ to be non-confrontational - as the viewer we are able to look at liis injury with curiosity or pity or whatever emotions we feel and noticel guilty for judging bi or examining the stump closely. There is a sense of Direct Chaze as he wants 18 to look all his urn. The shadow is in subtle 5.___around the vicum By viewing the person, not just the amputation, it is more real, more human and we realize that accidents like this do happen. The bright omnge, red and yellow6.___of thic background provide contrast to the photograph above, but they also add weight to achieve balance willing the poster The 7.___of the poster relies on the golden rectangle or the golden ratio that is visually or aesthetically pleasing The photograph, although smaller than the much larger contrasting section is chic more 8.___ in terms of the composition. The emphasis and unpact lic with the photograph. The colors are 9.___of langer and there is deliberate 10.___ with the red-orange around the care of the yellow center. The yellow, usually associated with happiness, draws attention to the symbolic railway cross at its heart. The use of space between the pan and the cross helps the viewer to glean several messages from the poster. The bold black capitalized font of the 11___is centered. The use of the capitalized 12.___which is more difficult to read than lower case, makes us concentrate on what the punis saying, as we make links to the image above The 13.___devices used in the poster are clear in their message.The pun is less direct than other examples of language used as it requires some thinking and linking between the image and language. The two meanings of cost' refer to a financial cost of $200 but more importantly, the physical and emotional impact of the loss of a limb or (as another link is made to the symbolic railway cross) ultimately the loss of life. The use of the personal pronoun "you" directly targets the viewer and the imperative commands the vicwer to "Stay of the tracks' The 14.___ while having a colloquial lone, reiterates the ultimatum to the viewer, with "The penalty is $200 or your life" The use of 15.___ here seems almost an understatement when referring to the loss of life.uhm i will accept 2 dares sa magsagot ng matino, thanks. ​</h2><br />

                            13. hChoosing the Right Path           Decisions and choices are the things that set senior high school apart from junior high school. Graduates have shared that deciding on the strand/track to take is just the beginning of creating choices. As we move to the next level, more critical choices are made.

These exits include higher education, middle level skills development, entrepreneurship, and employment. The decisions and choices to be made would rely on numerous factors like the resources and priorities. Senior high school may not be not college yet and not junior high school, but it is the important period in choosing the right path. - Cindy Sicat, Eastern Porac NHS1.

Alternative schools can be made up of a variety of different categories, such as the Montessori program or technical schools, which are typically self-paced and hands-on.

                            25. Barangay Delikado is an urban Barangay with 750 families. Most of the families are informal settlers who belong to the low-income group. Most of them work as vendors, jeepney and tricycle drivers, carpenters, government employees, and salespeople in a nearby mall. The community is accessible to main thoroughfares and services. 
Two rivers transverse through the community, causing flooding every time they overflow. The flood reaches the second floor of houses during heavy rains. 
The houses are usually of semi-light materials such as wood and iron sheets of roofing. Two fires occurred in the community last year, affecting a total of 60 families. The place is dense, and the alleys that lead to the main road are very narrow (almost 1.5 meters wide only), which made it difficult for firefighters to reach the area. 
The barangay officials are active but they do not agree on what development program to implement in her community. One-third of the committee members would like to accept the offer of the government to be relocated to a place about 30 kilometers away. On the other hand, the remaining officials resist the idea of relocation and insist that they should remain in the area. The people are also confused about what should be done.
