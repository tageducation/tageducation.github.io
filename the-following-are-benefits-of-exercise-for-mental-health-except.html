                        <p>The following are benefits of exercise for mental health:
</p><p>
</p><p>It <strong>reduces anxiety</strong>, Exercising diverts your attention away from the source of your anxiety. Moving your body reduces muscle tension, which reduces the body's contribution to anxiety.
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Boost brainpower</strong>, The brain receives more oxygen and nutrients as blood circulation increases. Exercise often causes useful proteins to be released in the brain. These nourishing proteins help to maintain the health of brain cells (also known as neurons) and facilitate the development of new neurons. Neurons are the brain's operational building blocks.
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Improve social well-being</strong>, Meeting people who share your interests allows you to form a new, supporting circle of friends.
</p><p>
</p><p>Except for increase stress levels, <strong>exercise does not increase the stress level.</strong>
