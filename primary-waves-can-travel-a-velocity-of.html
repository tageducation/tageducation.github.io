Directions: Identify the types of wave described in each number. Choose your answers
from the word bank and write on the space provided:
Love Wave
Rayleigh Wave
P-Waves
S-Waves
Surface Waves
Body waves
1. A longitudinal wave moving with great velocity in all directions in the inner layers of the
Earth. It can travel both in solid and fluid materials in the interior of the Earth.
2. High frequency waves moving in all directions in the inner layers of the Earth.
3. Low frequency waves traveling along the surface of the Earth. They are detected and
recorded by the seismograph after the arrival of the
S-waves.
4. A transverse wave but no vertical motion, wriggling like a snake causes the ground to
twist side by side resulting to great damages to people and environment.
5. A transverse wave moving from the source to the outer layer of the Earth with a velocity
about 40% lesser than the primary waves.
6. Waves characterized by rolling up and down motion in the surface of the Earth.</a>

                                            Before studying plate tectonics, let's talk first on moving crustal plates which is crucial in studying plate tectonics: earthquake. In your Grade 8, you learned the three types of seismic waves, Primary (P-waves), Secondary Waves (S-waves) and Long surface waves. The first two travel into the Earth's interior while the last one on the surface. These waves travel at different velocities, thus do not arrive at a seismic recording station at the same time. And if we have at least three recording stations, the epicenter of an earthquake can be determined using triangulation method.​</a>

                            24. Before studying plate tectonics, let's talk first on moving crustal plates which is crucial in studying plate tectonics: earthquake. In your Grade 8, you learned the three types of seismic waves, Primary (P-waves), Secondary Waves (S-waves) and Long surface waves. The first two travel into the Earth's interior while the last one on the surface. These waves travel at different velocities, thus do not arrive at a seismic recording station at the same time. And if we have at least three recording stations, the epicenter of an earthquake can be determined using triangulation method.​</h2><br />
