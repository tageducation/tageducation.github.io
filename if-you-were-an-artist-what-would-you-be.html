                        What Kind of Artist Would I Be?
<p>
</p>If I were to become an artist, I would like to be a photographer.<p>
</p><p>I am the type of person who loves to travel a lot. Every place that I go to has its own beauty. I usually go to historic places within the Philippines and some parts in Asia just like Singapore and Malaysia. I really hope that someday I would be able to travel the rest of the world.  </p><p>
</p><p>Every place that I have been to, will not only be stored on my heart and mind. I would definitely take pictures along with me. Pictures are free and you do not need an expensive camera just to take in pictures. It is my treasure and part of my collection.
</p><p>
</p><p>When I was a kid, I also dreamed to become a photographer. However, life has been a little bit hard for me that is why I was not able to pursue it. Being a photographer can simply capture what one sees in an artistic approach. Now that I have means of pursuing my dream, I started by taking pictures along with the trips that I had and will have in the future.
</p><p>
</p><p>I usually use my mobile phone and I also own a Sony digital single-lens reflex camera or DSLR. It is a type of camera that is a combination of single-lens reflex camera and a digital imaging sensor. It is a very nice camera that could produce an artistic approach and enhances beauty on the pictures that I have taken using it.

</p><p><strong>Canon EOS 5D Mark IV
</strong></p>This camera has a quiet shutter mechanism that could lessen vibration in which it is very useful for shooting long exposure and landscape shots. This is best for business type photographers. Though this might not be recommended for first time photographers as the settings of this camera is quite challenging.
<p>
</p><p><strong>Fujifilm X-T20
</strong></p>It has an easy navigating system and the LCD can be tilted to different angles and it has touchscreen monitor too.
<p>
</p><p><strong>Sony Alpha a6000
</strong></p>This is camera that would be best for beginners. It also has a high-resolution photos and has 24 megapixels.
<p>
</p><p><strong>Sony a7R III

<p>
</p><p><strong>Canon EOS Rebel T7i
</strong></p>This can also be used by beginners who wants to explore more on photography.  
<p>
</p><p><strong>Nikon D850
</strong></p>This camera is basically made for professionals who would need to use a decent camera to be able to capture high quality pictures.
<p>

                        <strong>Answer:</strong>Painter<strong>Explanation:</strong><p><strong>Art </strong>is defined as Even an essay on art may struggle to define art completely. Being an artist entails simply applying a pencil to paper or a brush to canvas. To many people, art can and does imply far more than that. Because art is a method of experiencing the world, a mode of expression, our need to produce it frequently feels compelled. As artists, we owe it to future generations to create.</p><p>Art may be a vehicle for exploring your surroundings and imagination. Art is a comprehensive category of human activity and product that entails creative or inventive ability that demonstrates technical excellence, beauty, emotional strength, or abstract concepts.  Thus, existence is an artistic endeavor. Art can encourage a beginner painter to experiment with a new medium or an expert artist to try a new method. Art is a means of imparting knowledge; it is also a means of acquiring knowledge. Art has the potential to be exhilarating, empowering, and a manifestation of love. </p><p>Artistic endeavors can be challenging. Art may be unpleasant and satisfying, eliciting feelings of success – or a desire to do more. Art can communicate politics, peace, cruelty, or beauty. Art can be a way of escape, idealization, or pure enjoyment. Art may be anything you allow it to be. Beyond the artist's intentions, there is what art is for people who view it. Numerous articles regarding specific works of art have been written. Even the most intuitive individual may have difficulty interpreting and comprehending artwork.</p><p>Art can have an equally profound effect on its audience and the artist. Viewing certain art pieces may elicit intense emotions or prompt individuals to explore something they had never considered earlier. While an artist may be inspired while doing work, others who observe it may also be encouraged. </p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>For more ideas and information, you may refer to or visit this link:</strong></p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/7966690</p><strong>#BrainlyEveryday</strong><p></p><br />
