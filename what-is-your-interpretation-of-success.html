                        AnswerIf your colleagues had an opportunity to tell us your primary strength what would that be? Your primary weakness what would that be?<p>Here's how to answer this question</p><p>The strength, in context, refers to what your friends think your good at. Notice that the question points to your 'colleagues' or 'friend' telling what your strength is, instead of yourself. An example, your friends feel confident when you do pep-talk with them. Then, encouraging people is your strength.</p><p>The weakness here refers to where a person(you) is having difficulties. For example, you are good at cleaning the house but bad at cooking. Another example can be observed in language. For you, "He's heavier than I am." is easier to process in the brain than "He weighs more than I do." Although the two literally mean the same.</p>What do you do when others resist of reject your ideas or actions?<p>You deliberate your idea, not your pride. Meaning, you prepare a solution for possible problems of your idea. And most importantly don't raise your voice</p><strong>Proverbs 15:1,</strong> A gentle answer turns away wrath, but a harsh word stirs up anger.<strong>What is your interpretation of "success?"</strong><p>For me, success is reaching your main goal without compromising moral or ethical principles, especially other people.</p>Suppose you are in a situation where deadlines and priorities change frequently and rapidly. How would you handle it?<p>Don't waste time, focus on accomplishing any given task.</p><strong>Proverbs 10:4</strong>, Lazy hands make for poverty, but diligent hands bring wealth.Tell me about a time when you were a part of a great team. What was your part in the success of your team?<p><strong>Safe answer: </strong>Listened to our leader and worked according to the assigned task. The answer here is based on personal experience</p>How would you describe an ideal work immersion supervisor?​<p>An ideal supervisor would be hands-on at supervising SHS students, and aware of the student's experience. </p><p></p><p><strong>An Act of Love - </strong> https://brainly.ph/question/8600372</p><p>#BrainlyFast</p><br />

</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Ticker tape</strong> are used in experiment in terms of acceleration, velocity and distance. When the distance between the dots in the ticker tapes are getting smaller, it means the object is slowing down or decelerating.
</p><p>Objects are moving faster or slower depending on the force applied and mass of the object exerted. With higher force, the acceleration of the object increases and lower force causes the object to move slower.
