                                            B. Identify the main idea and write your answer on your answer sheet. 15-16. One day, the children can't go out to play. They stayed at home and read stories. When they get tired they tell jokes to each other. Then Kim had another idea. They took out their drawing books and colored pens. Ben can't draw so he got his scissors and cut pictures. Tina got her sewing box and made dresses for her dolls. The children were kept busy the whole day. 17-18. People find their way among busy streets. They look at the traffic lights and watch out for road signs. They use the pedestrian lane when crossing. Pedestrians use the sidewalks. 19 - 20. Liza is sad. There's nobody to play with. "I will find a friend to play with today," Liza said.She went out, Ann passed by on her new bike. "Hi, what a nice bike you have," greeted Liza, "Want to try my bike?" invited Ann. Off the girls went biking. One on a bike while the other ran alongside. Their happy laughters rang from time to time as they circled the park.​</a>
