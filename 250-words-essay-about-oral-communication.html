                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Speaking is a natural ability given to most reluctant individuals. Since the beginning of time, it has been assumed that we have a right to speak and use words, thus we naturally begin our development of language during the early stages of live. After years of grasping and perfecting our vocabulary and language, it seems unnecessary to study the purpose of our development. Why, then, should we study “oral communication?” There are many purposes, benefits, and institutions that branch from oral communication. Of course, communication is the basis of interaction with other individuals through the use of expressions and words; however, through studying oral communication, one can take the words and expressions being used and apply them to his or her own life. After all, the most effective and useful knowledge is applied knowledge. </p><p>Interaction is a significant part of our daily lives. Oral communication with others is inevitable, and therefore it is crucial for us to acquire the skills to do so correctly. Aside from simply stating words or expressing ideas, oral communication serves various purposes. Oral communication allows an individual to express emotions, ideas, and feelings; it gives people the ability to empower, inspire, and motivate those who listen; and it allows people to share knowledge and traditions, as well as build their self-esteem. Oral communication is also useful in leading us to new discoveries, ideas, cultures, and perspectives (O’Neill). Thus, oral communication serves several different purposes in daily life; yet each of these purposes are connected to an even larger purpose.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Teaching oral communication in schools is becoming more infrequent. The importance of oral communication should be no different than the necessity of math, reading, or writing. Oral communication by definition is communication by word of mouth. Children must be confident in their speaking abilities because many careers require this skill. Schools must reconsider how important it is to promote oral communication, examine why it has been limited in schools, and learn how to teach it more effectively. Oral communication skills are a necessity that every child will need as an adult.
</p><p>
</p><p>Oral communication is an important skill because it promotes leadership and confidence. When children are confident in their abilities they will succeed academically and socially. It is important for students to generate their own ideas using outside references in the community (Joseph and Efron, pg 5-6). Oftentimes some students have trouble making friends. If they can learn to be more confident in their speaking abilities they will be more likely to approach their peers. On the other hand, when students feel comfortable expressing their ideas in front of people they will most likely contribute more to class discussions. Teachers always have difficulty with getting their students to participate constructively, so if the teacher spends more time teaching their students how to talk and respond coherently children will be more likely to contribute.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

In addition, being respectful to others in the process of communication, the person has much more opportunities to ‘get on’ better with people, because respecting the words and actions of others the person receives the same respect in response.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Oral communication</strong> refers to the exchange of spoken words for information. It is a verbal type of communication where you can express your ideas, provide facts, and discuss your thoughts. Conversations with friends, relatives, or coworkers, as well as presentations and speeches, are examples of oral communication. Oral communication promotes reliability and confidence. Oral communication is more efficient than writing an email or sending a text. You may rely on oral communication to get your point through, avoid misconceptions, and cause the least amount of uncertainty during critical and sensitive meetings, such as pay negotiations and even dispute resolution.</p><p></p><p>In a professional setting, oral communication can take many various forms. For career advancement, you require a variety of oral communication skills. Let's examine many forms of oral communication:</p><p><strong>1. Formal conversations</strong> - These occur frequently at work since you have to communicate with supervisors, coworkers, and stakeholders like clients and customers all the time. Formal exchanges are brief, concise, and direct. Everyone has a limited amount of time, so you must make your argument in a concise manner.</p><p></p><p><strong>2. Informal conversations</strong> - These are the types of discussions you have with your coworkers, as well as your friends and family. The majority of them lack agendas. You can share your day's events, organize your lunch, or talk about your weekend plans. These are cordial discussions laced with light humor.</p><p></p><p><strong>3. Speeches</strong> - Speeches are crucial in industries like event planning and community service. In a business setting, leaders and senior management are the only ones allowed to speak.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>To know more about communication visit the link below:</strong></p><p><strong>https://brainly.ph/question/25051614 </strong></p><p><strong>#SPJ2</strong></p><p></p><br />

I have learned that communication is not just about speaking, but it also involves listening and understanding. Effective communication requires the active participation of both the speaker and the listener. It is important to remember to be respectful and use appropriate language when communicating with others.</p><p></p><p>I have also learned about the different types of communication, such as verbal, nonverbal, and written. I have learned that each type of communication can be used to convey a message in a different way. I have also learned about the different strategies for effective communication, such as structuring a message, using appropriate language, and being aware of nonverbal cues.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, I have learned about the importance of being an active listener. Active listening requires concentration, asking questions, listening to understand rather than to reply, and reflecting on what is being said. Active listening helps to ensure that both parties are able to effectively communicate their ideas and feelings.</p><p></p><p>Finally, I have learned the importance of using feedback. Feedback provides an opportunity for both the speaker and the listener to understand each other better.

                        <p>As we know, in this world there are many different cultures. One culture is not the same as another and of course, there are many differences between them. In the current era of globalization, interaction can occur more easily. </p><p>The way to communicate with anyone is wide open, of course with the help of technological developments that are increasingly practical. In this way, <strong>communication between different cultures finally occurs.</strong></p><p>In the Cultural Studies of Communication, it is taught that<strong> cultural diversity is learned, not eliminated</strong>. That is, avoiding conflicts between different cultures, does not mean we have to equate all existing cultures. This might be able to minimize conflicts that could occur due to cultural differences, but it could also lead to other conflicts. </p><p>Therefore, cultural diversity cannot be eliminated just like that. Not feeling oneself and one's own culture as superior and demeaning other people's cultures, as well as wanting to learn to build better relationships between many cultures, is an attitude that is found by studying Cultural Studies of Communication.</p><p>As social beings, humans need to interact, whether in any form it is unavoidable, as well in inter-cultural interactions. We will always interact with other people from different cultures. </p><p>For example, as a student myself, I met friends from various islands, with different cultural backgrounds. I myself am a native of Sulawesi with a rather fast speech tempo and also a bit louder, while my friends are mostly Javanese who are famous for their calm nature. </p><p>There are differences here, but I understand my friend's culture and try to respect it. So, even though we have differences, we can still be friends and interact smoothly. </p><p>For this reason, studying Communication Cultural Studies can help us to interact better because Communication Cultural Studies is not only studying culture but also respecting the existing cultural diversity.</p><p></p><p>Learn more about essays at https://brainly.ph/question/18900841</p><p>#SPJ2</p><br />
