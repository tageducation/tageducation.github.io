                                            Directions: Read the statements on the sources of research topics. Write T if the
statement is true, and write F if the statement if false.
______1. Social constructivists believe that individuals seek understanding of the
world in which they live and work.
______2. The goal of the research is to rely as much as possible on the participants’
views of the situation being studied.
______3. The more open-ended the questioning, the better, as the researcher
listens carefully to what people say or do in their life settings.
______4. Constructivist researchers often address the processes of interaction
among individuals. They also focus on the specific contexts in which people live
and work in order to understand the historical and cultural settings of the
participants.
______5. Researchers recognize that their own backgrounds shape their
interpretation, and they position themselves in the research to acknowledge how
their interpretation flows from their personal, cultural, and historical experiences.
______6. Human beings construct meanings as they engage with the world they
are interpreting.
______7. Humans engage with their world and make sense of it based on their
historical and social perspectives—we are all born into a world of meaning
bestowed upon us by our culture.
______8. Qualitative researchers seek to understand the context or setting of the
participants through visiting this context and gathering information personally.
They also interpret what they find, an interpretation shaped by the researcher’s
own experiences and background.
______9. The basic generation of meaning is always social, arising in and out of
interaction with a human community. The process of qualitative research is largely
inductive; the inquirer generates meaning from the data collected in the field.
______10. A transformative worldview holds that research inquiry needs to be
intertwined with politics and a political change agenda to confront social
oppression at whatever levels it occurs.
______11. Research questions cannot be detached from the research problem.

______16. No research problem means there is research questions.
______17. You do not have to rely your research topic from your research
questions
______18. Your research questions are linked primarily to your research methods.
______19. Data not aligned to by the research questions can be collected.

The starting point of any research project is to formulate a question.2. The researcher's own personal interests and observations may be a valuable source of questions.3. Theories of other researchers are not a particularly good source of research questions.4. Successful research often raises new questions, even while it answers old questions.5. Research reports can be located quickly by use of an abstract system.6. Theories and research can raise new questions in two ways; heuristically and systematically.7. Research designed to find solutions to practical problems is referred to as a basic research8. Basic research findings often provide the basis to later applied research.9. A variable is defined as any set of events that may have different values.10. All variables can be manipulated by the researcher.11. An initially vague or general idea is first refined into a research hypothesis and then further refined into astatement of a problem.12. For low constraint research, it is especially critical to refine the statement of the problem as much aspossible.13. Behavioral variables refer to any stimulus in the environment that might affect our behavior.14. Organismic variables are always directly observable characteristics of the research participants, eg., heightor weight15. Stimulus variables may be either manipulated by the experimenter or an already existing part of theenvironment in which the research is being conducted.​1-26  po yan pasagot po NASA picture po lahat</a>

statement is true, and write F if the statement if false.
______1. Social constructivists believe that individuals seek understanding of the
world in which they live and work.
______2. The goal of the research is to rely as much as possible on the participants’
views of the situation being studied.
______3. The more open-ended the questioning, the better, as the researcher
listens carefully to what people say or do in their life settings.
______4. Constructivist researchers often address the processes of interaction
among individuals. They also focus on the specific contexts in which people live
and work in order to understand the historical and cultural settings of the
participants.
______5. Researchers recognize that their own backgrounds shape their
interpretation, and they position themselves in the research to acknowledge how
their interpretation flows from their personal, cultural, and historical experiences.
______6. Human beings construct meanings as they engage with the world they
are interpreting.
______7. Humans engage with their world and make sense of it based on their
historical and social perspectives—we are all born into a world of meaning
bestowed upon us by our culture.
______8. Qualitative researchers seek to understand the context or setting of the
participants through visiting this context and gathering information personally.
They also interpret what they find, an interpretation shaped by the researcher’s
own experiences and background.
______9. The basic generation of meaning is always social, arising in and out of
interaction with a human community. The process of qualitative research is largely
inductive; the inquirer generates meaning from the data collected in the field.
______10. A transformative worldview holds that research inquiry needs to be
intertwined with politics and a political change agenda to confront social
oppression at whatever levels it occurs.
______11. Research questions cannot be detached from the research problem.
______12. Research question are comparable to guideposts and a compass.
______13. The keyword in research question formulation is SMART.
______14. The general question must not be specified into smaller questions.
______15. There are two kinds of questions to be asked in a research work.
______16. No research problem means there is research questions.
______17. You do not have to rely your research topic from your research
questions
______18. Your research questions are linked primarily to your research methods.

                            12. ASSESSMENT: Analyze the statements below. Then, answer them if these are either True or False on the designatedblanks provided before the numbers.1. The starting point of any research project is to formulate a question.2. The researcher's own personal interests and observations may be a valuable source of questions.3. Theories of other researchers are not a particularly good source of research questions.4. Successful research often raises new questions, even while it answers old questions.5. Research reports can be located quickly by use of an abstract system.6. Theories and research can raise new questions in two ways; heuristically and systematically.7. Research designed to find solutions to practical problems is referred to as a basic research8. Basic research findings often provide the basis to later applied research.9. A variable is defined as any set of events that may have different values.10. All variables can be manipulated by the researcher.11. An initially vague or general idea is first refined into a research hypothesis and then further refined into astatement of a problem.12. For low constraint research, it is especially critical to refine the statement of the problem as much aspossible.13. Behavioral variables refer to any stimulus in the environment that might affect our behavior.14. Organismic variables are always directly observable characteristics of the research participants, eg., heightor weight15. Stimulus variables may be either manipulated by the experimenter or an already existing part of theenvironment in which the research is being conducted.​1-26  po yan pasagot po NASA picture po lahat</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Introduction
</p><p>This document provides guidance to Member States in the WHO European Region that wish to
</p><p>conduct behavioural insights studies related to COVID-19.
</p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic outbreak is placing an overwhelming burden on health systems and authorities
</p><p>to respond with effective and appropriate interventions, policies and messages.
</p><p>A poorly timed and managed pandemic response or transition phase can threaten the gains collectively
</p><p>achieved. The pandemic and its restrictions may have affected mental and physical well-being, social
</p><p>cohesion, economic stability as well as individual and community resilience and trust (1-5).
</p><p>In this complex context, understanding how, why and the context in which humans and communities
</p><p>respond allows to
</p><p>1) anticipate unwanted scenarios and initiate mitigating measures; and
</p><p>2) implement pandemic response measures that are better informed, situated, accepted and thus
</p><p>more effective.
</p><p>Population surveys can explore perceptions, acceptance of restrictions, mental and physical health,
</p><p>behaviours, information needs, misperceptions and more.
</p><p>WHO Regional Office for Europe and partners are offering Member States a tool to gain such insights
</p><p>which
</p><p>1) is evidence-informed;
</p><p>2) can be regularly applied;
</p><p>3) is flexible to adjust to the changing situation;
</p><p>4) follows high ethical standards.
</p><p>A few countries have rapidly instigated studies to gain such insights, and more countries are urged to
</p><p>prioritize such efforts to inform and support other response measures.
</p><p>The approach presented in this guidance document was developed based on a framework initiated by
</p><p>the University of Erfurt, Germany, German national health authorities and others (Box 3).
</p><p>This guidance document introduces:
</p><p>● guidance on the recommended process and steps
</p><p>● a sample methodology
</p><p>● advice for obtaining ethical clearance
</p><p>● a suggested sample questionnaire (Annex 1)
</p><p>● codes for data analysis and establishing a protected website for presentation of findings (Annex 2).
</p><p>WHO Europe’s Insights Unit and Health Emergencies Programme are offering support to countries for
</p><p>implementation. We urge all users of the tool to let us know their plans so that we can coordinate and
</p><p>share. This way, we can prevent that two institutions in one country are working in parallel on the same
</p><p>type of study.
