                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Freedom of expression is an inviolable human right and the basis of self-determination. Freedom of expression includes freedom of speech, media freedom, religious belief, freedom of assembly, freedom of association, and the right to report information without interfering with personal privacy. As a student, we also have the power to contribute for the betterment of our society. Students can talk, write articles, get together, and petition school officials. As they all say, age is only a number. If you have the effort and desire to contribute, there is nothing to stop you. Everyone needs to decide and look for ways in which you can do your part. We, as a student can still make a difference in how things happen around us. <strong>First</strong><strong>, </strong><strong>is </strong><strong>be aware</strong>. Contribution does not always have to be action. Sometimes, it is also important to keep yourself informed of what is happening around you. In addition, keeping up-to-date on important things can help you become a more responsible citizen. <strong>Second, spread awareness about troublesome things.</strong> If you think about it, there are many complaints from people around you. As you know, it's all about normal traffic tags, dirty roads and colonies, pollution and rising prices of declining natural resources. But did you know they can also contribute to these issues? Work like that. You can create an event with your friends to discuss common issues. You can also get help on the internet. <strong>Third</strong><strong>, </strong><strong>promoting </strong><strong>a </strong><strong>healthy </strong><strong>environment</strong><strong>. </strong>It feels good to live a healthy life. Imagine now contributing to the improvement of the entire environment! Creating a healthy environment not only allows you to function faster, but also motivates you to do better in life. You can improve your living environment by acting against agents that interfere with your living environment. We can work to improve everything from pollution to civil problems to local problems that plague our inhabitants. <strong>Lastly</strong><strong>, </strong><strong>p</strong><strong>articipate in or start a small activity or event that helps </strong><strong>others</strong><strong>. </strong>Even as a student, you can help others by carrying out various small activities, such as reading drivers, tree planting activities, lock cleaning and community services for the elderly nearby. You can also voluntarily spend time in places where you need help, such as an old house or orphan with care, or join a service group that uses community services.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.Knowing my particular learning style, I was a bit apprehensive when the only workable section of Business Statistics for my schedule was offered on-line. I usually perform best in a traditional class environment. The combination of an on-line class and the challenging nature of the material to be covered contributed to my nervousness. I found however, that it was not as bad as I had imagined. Do not get me wrong, there is a lot of work involved, but with the detailed lecture notes, assigned readings, homework problems, E-labs and computational tools, and most importantly Dr. Arsham’s encouragement you can succeed in this course.</p><p>It was exciting to be able to apply certain concepts learned in the course to an actual work assignment I was doing at the time. The ability to apply one concept in the "real world" encouraged me to look for ways to incorporate the other concepts learned.</p><p></p><p>2.Thank you very much Professor Arsham. I can truly say that out of all the statistics class that I have taken I learned the most in this one. In the past it was a matter of just going through the motions, but the way this course was run and the way the supplementary materials were provided above and beyond just reading the book, made things clearer and easier for me to understand. I fee like I "know" statistics. Thank you again.</p><p></p><p>3.I felt this was a valuable course and allowed me to get a good grasp of how statistics can be applied in business. The course was well taught and organized and Dr. Arsham was always very responsive, which I find helpful in and online class. The lectures notes are extremely are detailed and help you to comprehend the material. The websites and Elabs also provided additional information that helped me to comprehend the material. Even for those with statistical background, this is an excellent course that teaches you the application of statistics in business.</p><p></p><p>4.Dr. Arsham was one of the most professional and understanding instructors I have had at the University of Baltimore. He was very responsive to student's questions and was very fair in the grading process. Although his class was difficult, I believe that he helped students grasp very complex statistical subjects. The work assigned was time-consuming and demanding, but did prepare the student thoroughly for the mid-term and final exams.</p><p>Although I had the option of taking this class at a community college, I took it from Dr. Arsham because I was told that he was one of the best at communicating the concepts. I was not disappointed.</p><p></p><p>5.I truly enjoyed this class and really liked the student-professor interaction.</p><p>I get nervous when I take online classes because you just never know. I appreciated your fast responses to all the questions that I asked. It was a pleasure to be in your statistics class this semester.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>For those of us who work in community health and development, it's important to understand community -- what a community is, and the specific nature of the communities we work in. Anything we do in a community requires us to be familiar with its people, its issues, and its history. Carrying out an intervention or building a coalition are far more likely to be successful if they are informed by the culture of the community and an understanding of the relationships among individuals and groups within it.</p><p></p><p>Taking the time and effort to understand your community well before embarking on a community effort will pay off in the long term. A good way to accomplish that is to create a community description -- a record of your exploration and findings. It's a good way to gain a comprehensive overview of the community -- what it is now, what it's been in the past, and what it could be in the future. In this section, we'll discuss how you might approach examining the community in some detail and setting down your findings in a community description.</p><br />
