Copy the sentences that express opinion then underline the opinion-marking signals used in each sentence. Families are an integral part of one's life. I am confident to say that the family nerves as the first school to the child where one learns about various things. It's my belief that the basic knowledge about one's culture and identity comes from the family only. I know you will have to agree that that we are a reflection of our family. In my experience, we learn to socialize through our families only and develop our intellect. From my own point of view, people who live with their families tend to be happier than ones living alone. Definitely, all the good habits and manners one has incorporated are from his family only. I feel very lucky to be born in a family which has made me a better person. For me, they are my first teachers and my first friends.. I will always be grateful to my family for all they have done for me. It seems to me that my life is empty without them. 1:____________________2:___________________3:___________________4:___________________5:___________________6;___________________7:_________________8:_________________9:_________________10:_________________​</a>

                                            1)What’s in the basement?•Mommy told me never to go in the basement, but I wanted to see what was making that noise. It kind of sounded like a puppy, and I wanted to see the puppy, so I opened the basement door and tiptoed down a bit. I didn’t see a puppy, and then Mommy yanked me out of the basement and yelled at me. Mommy had never yelled at me before, and it made me sad and I cried. Then Mommy told me never to go into the basement again, and she gave me a cookie. That made me feel better, so I didn’t ask her why the boy in the basement was making noises like a puppy, or why he had no hands or feet2)Mommy’s home•I heard one, a father is laying in bed after just waking up, he grabs the baby monitor and walks to his desk in his office at home, he has his baby on the baby monitor and hears his wife singing to her, he cracks a smile as he hears his wife “Go to sleep… go to sleep…” When suddenly the front door opens up and his wife comes in with groceries.3)“Yees?“•When I was a child my family moved to a big old two-floor house, with big empty rooms and creaking floorboards. Both my parents worked so I was often alone when I came home from school. One early evening when I came home the house was still dark.I called out, “Mum?” and heard her sing song voice say “Yees?” from upstairs. I called her again as I climbed the stairs to see which room she was in, and again got the same “Yees?” reply. We were decorating at the time, and I didn’t know my way around the maze of rooms but she was in one of the far ones, right down the hall. I felt uneasy, but I figured that was only natural so I rushed forward to see my mum, knowing that her presence would calm my fears, as a mother’s presence always does.Just as I reached for the handle of the door to let myself in to the room I heard the front door downstairs open and my mother call “Sweetie, are you home?” in a cheery voice. I jumped back, startled and ran down the stairs to her, but as I glanced back from the top of the stairs, the door to the room slowly opened a crack. For a brief moment, I saw something strange in there, and I don’t know what it was, but it was staring at me​</a>

(This is my true story of my life)So Later on school in lunch, I used to sit on the empty place and eat.Example : 7 / 11 Seven Eleven, Park, School Grounds and etc.I once "Sweat my Eyes"(Tears) after I ate my lunch. And ask about my life as WHERE COULD IT BE OPPOSITE?. I hug myself and think of someone I hug, It's kinda painful to be alone. Everyone is sensitive and has a fears, My fair is being crowded in their Eye. Or getting suspicious in the crowd.I am not here for attention, I just wanna feel of how my life works, is it relatable from you?... I have oneThere are times, the school made my life down As I was hanging on the edge As they want the best for me. There are times, I HAD ENOUGH OF THIS. And cutted myself down.(Question You can answer)• Have you ever been Judge my a cover from your Teacher? How and Why?Me : Yes, for being an advance age student. I waa put inside the frame and getting blame.• Have you ever not feel the love than care from your family?Me : Yes, the life of my family is already fallen apart, My mother is not now close to my father, and living in the broken family has someone to feel frightened of.• Have you ever hide and cry in the dark?Me : Yes, I can't show my feelings from the fake smiles they force to make me. The lies I have made that I am alright to be in this family, Although I am not fit for it.• Have you ever know who you are?Me : I am a mixed person, I can be like an actor. The problem is my Emotions. I can go Positive, or negative in my self.​</a>

                            1. my family has made me</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>My family has made me a better person and helped me express who I am. </strong>They taught me good characteristics that I needed in my life as I grew old. Also, they made me a responsible human being in terms of duties and obligations at home and for myself and some school works. And today, I consider myself built by my family, wherein I would not pursue anything without them.  </p><p>
</p>Explanation:
<p>My <strong>family </strong>loved me through all these years. I considered them as a precious blessing from God in my existence. In all my bad times, they were here to support me and always got my back wherever I needed them the most. And I could say that my family had a significant role in my life, and I cannot imagine a life without them.  </p><p>
</p><p>For me, love never ends in my <strong>family</strong>. We tend to help one another through ups and downs and lift ourselves in our most challenging times. They also act like everything I see as superheroes in my life. Love your <strong>family</strong>, and as much as possible, look for a way to express love and care for them.  </p><p>
</p><p><strong>What are other ways to help build strong relationships with our family?
</strong></p>Cooperate and help one another
Love and care for them as much as they care for you
Support their back in times of distress
Bond and make time for each other
Pray always
Be kind and respectful  Practice good habits and express your good traits to them

I am confident to say that the family nerves as the first school to the child where one learns about various things. It's my belief that the basic knowledge about one's culture and identity comes from the family only. I know you will have to agree that that we are a reflection of our family. In my experience, we learn to socialize through our families only and develop our intellect. From my own point of view, people who live with their families tend to be happier than ones living alone. Definitely, all the good habits and manners one has incorporated are from his family only. I feel very lucky to be born in a family which has made me a better person. For me, they are my first teachers and my first friends.. I will always be grateful to my family for all they have done for me. It seems to me that my life is empty without them. 1:____________________2:___________________3:___________________4:___________________5:___________________6;___________________7:_________________8:_________________9:_________________10:_________________​</h2><br />

                            24. 1)What’s in the basement?•Mommy told me never to go in the basement, but I wanted to see what was making that noise. It kind of sounded like a puppy, and I wanted to see the puppy, so I opened the basement door and tiptoed down a bit. I didn’t see a puppy, and then Mommy yanked me out of the basement and yelled at me. Mommy had never yelled at me before, and it made me sad and I cried. Then Mommy told me never to go into the basement again, and she gave me a cookie. That made me feel better, so I didn’t ask her why the boy in the basement was making noises like a puppy, or why he had no hands or feet2)Mommy’s home•I heard one, a father is laying in bed after just waking up, he grabs the baby monitor and walks to his desk in his office at home, he has his baby on the baby monitor and hears his wife singing to her, he cracks a smile as he hears his wife “Go to sleep… go to sleep…” When suddenly the front door opens up and his wife comes in with groceries.3)“Yees?“•When I was a child my family moved to a big old two-floor house, with big empty rooms and creaking floorboards. Both my parents worked so I was often alone when I came home from school. One early evening when I came home the house was still dark.I called out, “Mum?” and heard her sing song voice say “Yees?” from upstairs. I called her again as I climbed the stairs to see which room she was in, and again got the same “Yees?” reply. We were decorating at the time, and I didn’t know my way around the maze of rooms but she was in one of the far ones, right down the hall. I felt uneasy, but I figured that was only natural so I rushed forward to see my mum, knowing that her presence would calm my fears, as a mother’s presence always does.Just as I reached for the handle of the door to let myself in to the room I heard the front door downstairs open and my mother call “Sweetie, are you home?” in a cheery voice. I jumped back, startled and ran down the stairs to her, but as I glanced back from the top of the stairs, the door to the room slowly opened a crack. For a brief moment, I saw something strange in there, and I don’t know what it was, but it was staring at me​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>In short, people tend to experience one or more of five different types of hallucinations:</p><p>Auditory. The presence of sounds or voices that aren't being triggered by an external stimulus are the most common form of hallucination. ... </p>Visual. ... Tactile. ... Olfactory. ... Gustatory.<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p>It's called a visual hallucination, and it can seem like your mind is playing tricks on you. Beyond being scary or stressful, it's also usually a sign that something else is going on. So if it's happening to you, talk to your doctor. That's the first step toward getting better.</p><p></p><p>Hallucinations can be the result of mental health problems like Alzheimer's disease, dementia or schizophrenia, but also be caused by other things including alcohol or drugs</p><p></p><p>so that's why you should never go to the basement or it just a ghost that's want you to help her</p><p></p><p>report me if im wrong</p><br />
