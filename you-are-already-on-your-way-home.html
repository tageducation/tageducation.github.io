Good study skills can increase your confidence, competence, and self-esteem.                                                                                                                       2.)

Consequences can be positive or negative. Positive consequences reinforce behaviour and make it more likely to happen again. Positive consequences include positive attention and praise and rewards for good behaviour.                                                                                                                          4.) Being disciplined and respecting elders in our life or self-discipline gives us confidence in terms of inner strength as it needs a lot of self-control and patience.                          5.)  Maintaining a clean environment reduces pollution, preserves our biosphere, protects endangered species, and also helps preserve the earth's natural resources.      </p><p> </p><p>                     That's how you can contribute to the world by studying well, being responsible, having a good behavior, know how to respect elders and cleaning the environment can change the world by doing them not just because it's necessary but also to be a kind person that can be a model of the youth.</p><p></p><p></p><p>I hope it's help </p><br />
