They are highly available everywhere. They can be found in books, newspapers, magazines, mobile phones, television and other online sources. Evaluating images if they are fact or non-fact is important in understanding the message they send. You are expected to identify and real or make-believe, fact or non-fact images, and reflect on the contexts of read poem/s in creating or illustrating real or make-believe, fact or non-fact images. Learning Task 1 Directions: Examine the two images given on page 6 of the English module, then answer the following questions. 1. Which of the two images can be considered real? 2. Which image is just a make-believe? 3-5. Why do you say so? Justify or prove your answer in three sentences.​</a>

INTRODUCTION Images portray visual perception of persons, place, events, animals, things and the like. These images may be real or make-believe depending on the contexts they signify. They are highly available everywhere. They can be found in books, newspapers, magazines, mobile phones, television and other online sources. Evaluating images if they are fact or non-fact is important in understanding the message they send. You are expected to identify and real or make-believe, fact or non-fact images, and reflect on the contexts of read poem/s in creating or illustrating real or make-believe, fact or non-fact images. Learning Task 1 Directions: Examine the two images given on page 6 of the English module, then answer the following questions. 1. Which of the two images can be considered real? 2. Which image is just a make-believe? 3-5. Why do you say so? Justify or prove your answer in three sentences.​</h2><br />

View of a tropical cyclone of an angle (Bottom) Cross-section of a typhoon</h2><br />
                        <p>[tex]{\huge{\boxed{\boxed{\red{\bm{\mathsf{Answer}}}}}}}[/tex]</p><p></p>How the typhoon generates its strong winds. The clouds associated with a typhoon form even at great distances from the eye. Cloud formation and rainfall is greatest around the eye. But surprisingly, the eye is usually free of clouds with little or no wind.Around the eye, there is a very rapid upward movement of air leading to cloud formation and rain. Within the eye, the air undergoes a sinking motion. Increasing pressure at the lower levels compresses the air that results in an increase in temperature. Thus, the warm air within the air remains relatively free of clouds.A typhoon usually forms over warm tropical oceans that are sufficiently far from the equator (greater than 5°). Condensation of water vapor releases vast amounts of energy to the surrounding air. Warming of the air makes it buoyant and causes the air to rise even more. The reduction of pressure causes the air at the surface to rush toward the center and rise, releasing even more energy as the water vapor condenses. Depending on certain conditions, this process can go on and on and can intensify to a tropical cyclone.Condensation of water vapor serves as the fuel that keeps the typhoon going. When a typhoon makes landfall, its energy source is cut off and starts to dissipate within a few days.<p></p><p></p><p>[tex]{\huge{\boxed{\bm{\mathsf{Hope\:It\:Helps}}}}}[/tex]</p><p>[tex]{\boxed{\red{\mathfrak{Hikari\:Going\:Down}}}}[/tex]</p><p>[tex]{\large{\bm{\mathsf{Be\:Brainly}}}}[/tex]</p><br />
