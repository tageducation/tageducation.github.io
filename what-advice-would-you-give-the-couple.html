What advice would you give the couple?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Family planning</strong> is widely used throughout the world but uptake of the individual methods varies enormously in different countries. Before getting married the couple should attend a seminar regarding Family Planning regarding which determine the time, spacing, and frequency of pregnancy with a range of methods for preventing or expelling a conception while maintaining a normal sex life. Hormonal contraception is available in many delivery systems and the combined contraceptive pill is a safe and popular method. Family planning is a basic component of the sexual and reproductive health package. Fertility by choice, not by chance, is a basic requirement for women's health. A woman who does not have the means to regulate and control her fertility cannot be considered in a ‘state of complete physical, mental and social well-being. </p><p>In terms of the law, there are some policies that they were going to do, wherein the couple must have consent and it should be legal. There should be a valid marriage license and authority and of course the marriage ceremony that has a witness. Before planning to get married make sure that there is no problem especially in Cenomar, which is very important because if a person is already married he or she can’t marry again. Make sure that you love that person and you are willing to give your full commitment for the rest of your life. </p><p></p><p>Read How does the law affect the character at https://brainly.ph/question/459972, https://brainly.ph/question/1781390</p><p>What advice would you give to the woman at https://brainly.ph/question/833320</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                            23. What advice would you give to a smoker?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>the advice i will give to smoker is stop smoking with that ciggarett beacasue she can also get sick from smoking </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>If you want to stop smoking here’s the best advice that I could give you.  The first thing I would say is, smoking is actually not physically addictive for very long after you stop smoking.  So we know from studies that about 100 hours after your last cigarette, all of the nicotine is out of your bloodstream.  And once all the nicotine is out of your bloodstream you’re no longer physically addicted to cigarettes.  </p><p></p><p>Now that being said, you might be behaviorally addicted.  You might have these habits that have grown up around smoking.  So when someone who, two years after they gave up cigarettes, has a cup of coffee in the morning and has this urge to smoke with their cup of coffee, that’s not a physical addiction, that’s a habitual urge that’s reemerging and is making itself know.  So if you want to stop smoking, if we recognize that all you have to do is make it through the first 100 hours and you’ll not be physically addicted to nicotine anymore, what you need to do is you need to recognize the cues and the rewards that you usually associate with smoking.  </p><p></p><p>So, you probably, if you’re a smoker, have a cigarette every morning with a cup of coffee. And the reward that it delivers is probably this feeling of kind of; I don’t know, you know, stimulation.  Because the truth of the matter is, smoking and nicotine actually work.  Right? The reason why people smoke is because it makes you feel kind of pepped up.  So, in the morning when you’re having your cup of coffee, you need another routine that delivers that same reward.  If you used to drink decaf, you need to start drinking two shots of Espresso. You need something that is going to give you that sense of being pepped up, of energy, of whatever a cigarette used to provide.  And that will help you to change the behavior in this habit.  </p><p></p><p></p><p>Now, some people smoke, and maybe you smoke because it’s social.  Right?  Because when you’re at a bar, you don’t know what to do with your hands or it’s a convenient way to go outside and gossip with your colleagues in the middle of the day or it’s a way to take a break.  If that’s the reward that smoking is serving for you, you need to find a new routine that delivers that same reward.  So that could mean that during the middle of the day, you have a couple of friends that you take a walk with around the block and you’ve planned this in advance.  Or at a bar, you have something else to do with your hands.  But you can’t just say, “I’m gonna quit smoking.”  You have to figure out what the cue is and what the reward its delivering is and find a new routine to sort of shoehorn in.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <strong>Republic Act 10354 or the Responsible Parenthood and Reproductive Health Act</strong>This is the health policy that is concerned in this situation.It directs the government to adequately address Filipinos' needs in the areas of responsible parenting and reproductive health.In the Philippines, this law provided universal access to contraception, fertility control, sexual education, and maternal care.It ensures the provision, delivery, and accessibility of reproductive health care services, as well as the promotion, protection, and realization of women's reproductive health and rights.<p></p>Family Planning<p>This would be my advice to the couple.</p><p>Individuals and couples make voluntary, responsible decisions about the size of their families and the timing of their births, which is referred to as family planning. As a result, on the microlevel, children are born because they are desired and cared for, and on the macrolevel, it contributes to the improvement of human life.</p><p></p>What are the advantages of family planning?<p>Reduces the burden and responsibility of providing for his family. Allows him to provide for his children's basic needs (food, shelter, education, and better future). Allows him to devote more time to his family and personal development. Allows enough time for treatment and recovery when suffering from an illness.</p><p></p>What does it mean to be a responsible parent?<p>Responsible parenting is defined as parents' willingness and ability to respond to the needs and aspirations of their family and children.</p><p></p>Why is it important to be a responsible parent?<p>We most often learn social values such as kindness, honesty, altruism, and so on from responsible parents. Responsible parents also teach their children how to function in society. The values and parenting style of parents can fundamentally shape children as people.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>What is family planning and why is it important: https://brainly.ph/question/417601<br /></strong></p><p><strong>#BrainlyEveryday</strong></p><br />

Though it has a good intention to minimized population, and to give a good future for the family. but still this Bill received different reactions and condemnations from the public and religious sectors. Christian community is against this bill for the reason that it is also against the will of God.
