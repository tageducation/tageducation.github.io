                        The product of the post industrial society <p></p><p>The answer is <strong>Industrial </strong>society.</p><p></p><p>In sociology, an <strong>industrial </strong>society is one that is characterized by the use of technology and machinery to enable mass production while also maintaining a big population with a high division of labor capability. Following the <strong>Industrial </strong>Revolution, such a structure arose in the Western world, displacing the agrarian cultures of the pre-modern, pre-<strong>industrial </strong>era. <strong>Industrial </strong>societies are often mass societies, and an information society may supersede them. Traditional societies are frequently contrasted with them. External energy sources, such as fossil fuels, are used by <strong>industrial </strong>societies to increase the rate and scale of production. Food production is shifted to large commercial farms, where <strong>industrial </strong>products, such as combine harvesters and fossil fuel-based fertilizers, are used to reduce human labor requirements while increasing output. Excess labor is relocated into these factories when it is no longer needed for food production. Mechanization is used to further boost efficiency. Many people are shifting to expanding service industries as populations grow and technology improves, frequently to the point of automation.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>It is the product of the post-industrial society.</p><p>brainly.ph/question/22695009</p><p>#LETSSTUDY</p><br />
