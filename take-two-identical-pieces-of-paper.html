When I got home from school after a long boring day, I took out the peanut bu bread. After taking the lid off of the jars, I spread the peanut butter on one side of the brea on the other, and then I put the two pieces of bread together.

All matter, all things can be changed in two ways: chemically and physically and physical changes affect the state of matter. Physical changes are those that do not make-up or identity of the matter. For example, clay will bend or flatten if squeezed, but Changing the shape of clay is a physical change, and does not change the matter's ider changes turn the matter into a new kind of matter with different properties. For example burnt, it becomes ash and will never be paper again. The difference between them is to changes are temporary or only last for a little while, and chemical changes are perman they last forever. Physical and chemical changes both affect the state of matter. 3. Dr. Miller doesn't want the tigers to vanish. These majestic beasts are dis alarming rate.

                                            6. All matter , all things can be changed in two ways : chemically and physically . Both chemical and physical changes affect the state of matter .

                                            Passage #1 - Chemical and Physical Changes All matter, all things can be changed in two ways: chemically and physically. Both chemical and physical changes affect the state of matter. Physical changes are those that do not change the make-up or identity of the matter. For example, clay will bend or flatten if squeezed, but it will still be clay. Changing the shape of the clay is a physical change, and does not change the matter's identity. Chemical changes turn the matter into a new kind of matter with different properties. For example, when paper is bent, it becomes ash and will never be paper again. The difference between them is that physical change are temporary or only last for a little while, and chemical changes are permanent, which means they last forever. Physical and chemical changes both affect the state of matter. Passage #2 - The Best PB and J Ever When I got home from school after a long boring day, I took out the peanut butter, jelly, and bread. After taking a lid off the jars, I spread the peanut butter on one side of the bread and the jelly on the other, and then I put the two pieces of bread together. After that, I enjoyed it while watching "Cops on the TV. I swear, it was the best peanut butter and jelly sandwich I have ever eaten. Passage #3 - Save the Tigers Dr. Miller doesn't want the tigers to vanish. These majestic beasts are disappearing at an alarming rate. Dr. Miller think that we should write to our congress people. If we let them know that we demand the preservation of this species, maybe we can make a difference. Dr. Miller also thinks that we should donate to save the tigers. Our donations will help support and empower those who are fighting the hardest to preserve the tigers. We owe it to our grandchildren to do something.​</a>

Many people are confused about why our economy went to shambles in 2008. The crisis was actually the result of a combination of many complex factors. First, easy credit conditions allowed people who were high-risk or unworthy of credit to borrow, and even people who had no income were eligible 15 for large loans. Second, banks would bundle these toxic loans and sell them as packages on the financial market. Third, large insurance firms backed these packages, misrepresenting these high-risk loans as safe investments. Fourth, because of the ease of acquiring credit and the rapid growth in the housing market, people were buying two or three houses, intending to sell them for more than they paid. All of these factors created bubbles of speculation. These bubbles burst, sending the whole market into a downward spiral, causing employers to lose capital and lay off employees. Consumer spending then dropped and most businesses suffered. The economy is like a big boat, and once it gets moving quickly in the wrong direction, it's hard to turn it around. Answer: Purpose Structure 5. Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered corona virus. Most people infected with the COVID -19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment. Older people and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness. The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is be well informed about the virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads. This virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when the infected person coughs or sneezes. At this time, there are no specific vaccines or treatments for COVID 19.

1. All matter, all things can be changed in two ways: chemically and physically. Both chemical and physical changes affect the state of matter. Physical changes are those that do not change the make-up or identity of the matter. For example, clay will bend or flatten if squeezed, but it will still be clay. Changing the shape of clay is a physical change, and does not change the matter’s identity. Chemical changes turn the matter into a new kind of matter with different properties. For example, when paper is burnt, it becomes ash and will never be paper again. The difference between them is that physical changes are temporary or only last for a little while, and chemical changes are permanent, which means they last forever. Physical and chemical changes both affect the state of matter.

After that, I enjoyed it while watching “Cops” on the TV. I swear, that was the best peanut butter and jelly sandwich I ever ate.
3. No one knows exactly what causes tornados, but some scientists believe that when warm air meets cold air, a tornado may form. The reason for this is that the warm air is lighter than the cold air, so it rises up fast and meets different winds moving different directions. Under the right conditions, this can cause a tornado. Though there is still much mystery surrounding tornados, many people believe that when warm moist air meets cool dry air, tornados can result.
4. The playground at the park is built for fun. There are plenty ways to get to the top just like – a ladder, a stairway, and even a rock wall. Once at the top, kids can find plenty of things to play with, like a curved tube, two different steering wheels, and even a tic-tac-toe board. And two curved sliding boards make the perfect way to return to the ground.
5. Working on a computer may be easier and safer than working in a mine, but it doesn’t come without risks. Using a computer for a long time can lead to poor eyesight, muscle loosening, back pain, and injuries to the hands and wrists. If you find yourself working or playing on a computer quite regularly, take a few steps to prevent these problems and you’ll thank yourself later. When you are computing for a long time, take frequent breaks. Get up and walk around every once and while. Exercise a little bit. Take your eyes off of the computer screen. Stretch your hands and wrists. Straighten your back. It can be hard to pull yourself away from your computer once you get into a zone, but your body will thank you later if you do. Make your health a priority and don’t worry so much about what’s happening on that little screen.
6. Bicycles are an excellent choice when it comes to transportation. Biking is healthy and faster than walking, but it is also dangerous. Each year tens of thousands of people are killed or injured while riding a bicycle. This is because our roads are designed for motorists and not cyclists, but we can change the landscape. Each time a road is built or rebuilt, we should put in bike lanes. Clearly marked bicycle lanes will give cyclists a safer place to ride. Our cyclists deserve this little bit of consideration. In fact, their very lives are depending on it.
7. There’s a reason why dogs are called “man’s best friend.” The good friendship that we have with dogs is thousands of years old and, as with most good friendships, was formed by mutual benefit. Dogs are of great value to people because they use their keen senses to detect threats and alert their owners by barking. You may find your dog’s yapping to be quite annoying, but under some circumstances it can be quite helpful. But people are of great value to dogs too. Dogs who live with people usually have easier access to food and a safer place to stay than they would on their own, and that truly is what friends are for.</a>

physically. Both chemical and physical changes affect the state of malter
All matter, all things can be changed in two ways: chemically and
matter. For example, clay will bend or flatten if squeezed, but it will still be day.
Physical changes are those that do not change the make-up or identity of the
matter's identity. Chemical changes turn the matter into a new kind of matter
Changing the shape of clay is a physical change, and does not change the
with different properties. For example, when paper is burnt, it becomes ash and
will never be paper again. The difference between them is that physical changes
are temporary or only last for a little while, and chemical changes are permanent,
which means they last forever. Physical and chemical changes both affect the
state of matter.

                            16. Passage #1 - Chemical and Physical Changes All matter, all things can be changed in two ways: chemically and physically. Both chemical and physical changes affect the state of matter. Physical changes are those that do not change the make-up or identity of the matter. For example, clay will bend or flatten if squeezed, but it will still be clay. Changing the shape of the clay is a physical change, and does not change the matter's identity. Chemical changes turn the matter into a new kind of matter with different properties. For example, when paper is bent, it becomes ash and will never be paper again. The difference between them is that physical change are temporary or only last for a little while, and chemical changes are permanent, which means they last forever. Physical and chemical changes both affect the state of matter. Passage #2 - The Best PB and J Ever When I got home from school after a long boring day, I took out the peanut butter, jelly, and bread.

Both chemical and physical changes affect the state of matter. Physical changes are those that do not change the identity of the matter. For instance, clay will bend if squeezed. Still it will be a clay. Change in shape is a physical change. It does not change the matter's identity. Chemical changes turn the matter into a new kind of matter with different properties. For instance, when paper is burnt, it becomes ash. It will never be paper again. The difference between them is that physical changes are temporary. While chemical changes are permanent.

Our donations will help to support and empower those who are fighting the hardest to preserve the tigers. We owe it to our grandchildren to do something. Answer: Purpose Structure 4. Many people are confused about why our economy went to shambles in 2008. The crisis was actually the result of a combination of many complex factors. First, easy credit conditions allowed people who were high-risk or unworthy of credit to borrow, and even people who had no income were eligible 15 for large loans. Second, banks would bundle these toxic loans and sell them as packages on the financial market. Third, large insurance firms backed these packages, misrepresenting these high-risk loans as safe investments. Fourth, because of the ease of acquiring credit and the rapid growth in the housing market, people were buying two or three houses, intending to sell them for more than they paid. All of these factors created bubbles of speculation. These bubbles burst, sending the whole market into a downward spiral, causing employers to lose capital and lay off employees. Consumer spending then dropped and most businesses suffered. The economy is like a big boat, and once it gets moving quickly in the wrong direction, it's hard to turn it around. Answer: Purpose Structure 5. Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered corona virus. Most people infected with the COVID -19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment. Older people and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness. The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is be well informed about the virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads. This virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when the infected person coughs or sneezes. At this time, there are no specific vaccines or treatments for COVID 19.

1. All matter, all things can be changed in two ways: chemically and physically. Both chemical and physical changes affect the state of matter. Physical changes are those that do not change the make-up or identity of the matter. For example, clay will bend or flatten if squeezed, but it will still be clay. Changing the shape of clay is a physical change, and does not change the matter’s identity. Chemical changes turn the matter into a new kind of matter with different properties. For example, when paper is burnt, it becomes ash and will never be paper again. The difference between them is that physical changes are temporary or only last for a little while, and chemical changes are permanent, which means they last forever. Physical and chemical changes both affect the state of matter.
2. When I got home from school after a long boring day, I took out the peanut butter, jelly, and bread. After taking the lid off of the jars, I spread the peanut butter on one side of the bread and the jelly on the other, and then I put the two pieces of bread together. After that, I enjoyed it while watching “Cops” on the TV. I swear, that was the best peanut butter and jelly sandwich I ever ate.
3. No one knows exactly what causes tornados, but some scientists believe that when warm air meets cold air, a tornado may form. The reason for this is that the warm air is lighter than the cold air, so it rises up fast and meets different winds moving different directions. Under the right conditions, this can cause a tornado. Though there is still much mystery surrounding tornados, many people believe that when warm moist air meets cool dry air, tornados can result.
4. The playground at the park is built for fun. There are plenty ways to get to the top just like – a ladder, a stairway, and even a rock wall. Once at the top, kids can find plenty of things to play with, like a curved tube, two different steering wheels, and even a tic-tac-toe board. And two curved sliding boards make the perfect way to return to the ground.
5. Working on a computer may be easier and safer than working in a mine, but it doesn’t come without risks. Using a computer for a long time can lead to poor eyesight, muscle loosening, back pain, and injuries to the hands and wrists. If you find yourself working or playing on a computer quite regularly, take a few steps to prevent these problems and you’ll thank yourself later. When you are computing for a long time, take frequent breaks. Get up and walk around every once and while. Exercise a little bit. Take your eyes off of the computer screen. Stretch your hands and wrists. Straighten your back. It can be hard to pull yourself away from your computer once you get into a zone, but your body will thank you later if you do. Make your health a priority and don’t worry so much about what’s happening on that little screen.
6. Bicycles are an excellent choice when it comes to transportation. Biking is healthy and faster than walking, but it is also dangerous. Each year tens of thousands of people are killed or injured while riding a bicycle. This is because our roads are designed for motorists and not cyclists, but we can change the landscape. Each time a road is built or rebuilt, we should put in bike lanes. Clearly marked bicycle lanes will give cyclists a safer place to ride. Our cyclists deserve this little bit of consideration. In fact, their very lives are depending on it.
7. There’s a reason why dogs are called “man’s best friend.” The good friendship that we have with dogs is thousands of years old and, as with most good friendships, was formed by mutual benefit. Dogs are of great value to people because they use their keen senses to detect threats and alert their owners by barking. You may find your dog’s yapping to be quite annoying, but under some circumstances it can be quite helpful. But people are of great value to dogs too. Dogs who live with people usually have easier access to food and a safer place to stay than they would on their own, and that truly is what friends are for.</h2><br />
