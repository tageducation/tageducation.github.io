                                            Why Do Dogs Bury HIPBUNU.It may seem crazy when you watch your dog bury his favorite bone or chew toy, only todig it up a day or two later, but there is actually a reason behind why dogs bury theirbones it is simply in their nature For thousands of years, dogs have buried their bonesThe practice itself started long before dogs were even pets when their ancestors had tobury bones to surviveWhen dogs lived in the wild, sometimes food was scarce. If they were able to find meatand bones, dogs became very protective of it. Sometimes they would have more meatthan they could eat for one meal To keep other dogs and animals from stealing theirmeat, dogs would bury it in the ground. When it was time for the next meal, they woulddig up their bones and enjoy them again. This would continue until the meat and boneswere goneEven though most dogs have plenty of food to eat today, their instincts still tell them tobury their bones and favorite toys. They do this to keep other dogs and animals fromstealing them, just like their ancestors did some dogs hide more than one bone at once,burying one so they can go dig up another. This can leave a backyard full of holes and,well, bonesSo how do dogs decide where to bury their bones? A dog cannot bury a bone justanywhere. No, he must first find the perfect spot. This involves using his nose to sniff outa spot that is free from predators. Often it is near a tree or a large rock but it could bevirtually anywhere in the yard Once the dog finds the perfect spot, he uses his frontpaws to dig the hole, drops in the bone and covers up the hole to protect his treasureUnfortunately, even when dogs bury their bones near a special tree or mark the territory,they do not always remember where a bone is buried. Thankfully, dogs have animpeccable sense of smell A dog can smell a bone even if it has been buned for yearsand dig at up Most of the time, dogs find bones they have buned on their own, but theycan also find bones bured by other dogs.

                                            BUYER BEHAVIOUR AND RELATIONSHIP DEVELOPMENT RESEARCH COMPANY TRIES TO SHOW THAT YOU CAN ONLY UNDERSTAND CONSUMER BEHAVIOUR BY LIVING WITH THEIR BEHAVIOUR How can any marketer get inside your mind to understand how you actually make purchase decisions? Structured questionnaire surveys may have a role for collecting large scale factual data, but they have major weaknesses when it comes to understanding individuals' attitudes. Qualitative approaches, such as focus groups can get closer to the truth, but participants often still find themselves inhibited from telling the full story. Many marketing managers, especially those without large research budgets, inevitably end up relying on their own personal experiences to understand how consumers behave. This may be easy for target markets which are in the 20-40 age range (the age of typical marketers), but how do you get inside the mind of teenagers, or elderly people? Ethnographic approaches are becoming increasingly popular among marketers as a means of getting closer to the truth about consumer behaviour. Ethnographic research is nothing new, having been used by anthropologists in their study of the rituals of tribal people. Marketers have been relatively recent converts to the techniques of ethnography. The advertising agency BMP DDB has taken on board the techniques of ethnography in its "Project Keyhole" in a manner which is reminiscent of anthropologists' practice of living with tribes in order to understand them. Its consumer researchers live with a family for several days in order to record their every move. The project is designed to meet the needs of client companies who are looking for more than the data gathered using traditional quantitative and qualitative research techniques. Participants record their views and actions on a digital video camera, in the presence of a researcher who stays with them from 8am until 10pm for a few days.A normal project would last four or five days and the client may be invited along for part of the time. Participants are paid £100 for their troubles. What did they do with the direct mail when it came through the letter box? Did they use the coupon offer which it contained? Who drinks the fresh orange juice in the house? How long do they spend cooking dinner? How do they actually cook the ready-prepared meals they bought earlier? Does the family eat together? These are examples of the vital information that sponsoring companies hope to get hold of in order to position their products more effectively. According to the company, the advantage of this method over conventional research is that it picks up inconsistencies between what people say they are doing and what they actually do. Following them throughout the day allows the researcher to see why a person's habits might change according to random factors such as their mood, the time of day or the weather. Crucially it reveals the quirks in our behaviour that marketers are desperate to gain an insight into. For example, a person's store-card data might tell you that they buy bread and margarine, but it doesn't tell whether they eat the bread fresh, or toast it first before putting margarine on it. In 1998, the magazine Marketing put this novel research method to the test with a guinea pig family called the Jones's. It then compared the results of this approach with more traditional methods of profiling customers. In short, established systems such as CACI, Claritas and Experian might say one thing about the buying behaviour of a family, using lifestyle and electoral roll data, but did they bear any relation to reality? The information that the researcher gathered in a short space of time told a lot about the Jones family. By contrast, the database information about the Joneses, although detailed and often accurate, could not capture the quirks and details that make up the personality of the family. For example, it transpired that the Joneses had a keener than average eye on value for money. Although information on them from the four database companies correctly suggested that they enjoy luxuries like good food and foreign holidays, it didn't say anything about the real life factors that influence their purchasing decisions. The most noticeable of these was that although they like good food, Mrs Jones mixed her shopping between the supermarket and a local discount store which sells cut-price brands. This means that she only bought at Tesco or Sainsbury's what she could not get cheaper elsewhere. She showed the researcher a can of branded plum tomatoes which she got for 10p at the discount store as an example, explaining that it would have cost 26p in the supermarket. Mrs Jones prided herself on being able to hunt down bargains like this and occasionally rewarded herself by buying "something luxurious", such as smoked salmon from Marks &amp; Spencer. ​</a>

When it comes to eating, many of us have developed habits. Some are good (“I always eat fruit as a dessert”), and some are not so good (“I always have a sugary drink after work as a reward”).  Even if you’ve had the same eating pattern for years, it’s not too late to make improvements.<p></p>3. Yes, the food you eat can affect your health and your risk for certain diseases. To eat healthier food, you may need to change some of your daily habits. You also may need to change some things in your environment. Your environment includes everything around you, like your home or the place you work.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>correct me if im wrong ^-^ pa brainliest if correct &lt;3</p><br />

                            6. Why Do Dogs Bury HIPBUNU.It may seem crazy when you watch your dog bury his favorite bone or chew toy, only todig it up a day or two later, but there is actually a reason behind why dogs bury theirbones it is simply in their nature For thousands of years, dogs have buried their bonesThe practice itself started long before dogs were even pets when their ancestors had tobury bones to surviveWhen dogs lived in the wild, sometimes food was scarce. If they were able to find meatand bones, dogs became very protective of it. Sometimes they would have more meatthan they could eat for one meal To keep other dogs and animals from stealing theirmeat, dogs would bury it in the ground. When it was time for the next meal, they woulddig up their bones and enjoy them again. This would continue until the meat and boneswere goneEven though most dogs have plenty of food to eat today, their instincts still tell them tobury their bones and favorite toys. They do this to keep other dogs and animals fromstealing them, just like their ancestors did some dogs hide more than one bone at once,burying one so they can go dig up another. This can leave a backyard full of holes and,well, bonesSo how do dogs decide where to bury their bones? A dog cannot bury a bone justanywhere. No, he must first find the perfect spot. This involves using his nose to sniff outa spot that is free from predators. Often it is near a tree or a large rock but it could bevirtually anywhere in the yard Once the dog finds the perfect spot, he uses his frontpaws to dig the hole, drops in the bone and covers up the hole to protect his treasureUnfortunately, even when dogs bury their bones near a special tree or mark the territory,they do not always remember where a bone is buried. Thankfully, dogs have animpeccable sense of smell A dog can smell a bone even if it has been buned for yearsand dig at up Most of the time, dogs find bones they have buned on their own, but theycan also find bones bured by other dogs.

                            19. BUYER BEHAVIOUR AND RELATIONSHIP DEVELOPMENT RESEARCH COMPANY TRIES TO SHOW THAT YOU CAN ONLY UNDERSTAND CONSUMER BEHAVIOUR BY LIVING WITH THEIR BEHAVIOUR How can any marketer get inside your mind to understand how you actually make purchase decisions? Structured questionnaire surveys may have a role for collecting large scale factual data, but they have major weaknesses when it comes to understanding individuals' attitudes. Qualitative approaches, such as focus groups can get closer to the truth, but participants often still find themselves inhibited from telling the full story. Many marketing managers, especially those without large research budgets, inevitably end up relying on their own personal experiences to understand how consumers behave. This may be easy for target markets which are in the 20-40 age range (the age of typical marketers), but how do you get inside the mind of teenagers, or elderly people? Ethnographic approaches are becoming increasingly popular among marketers as a means of getting closer to the truth about consumer behaviour. Ethnographic research is nothing new, having been used by anthropologists in their study of the rituals of tribal people. Marketers have been relatively recent converts to the techniques of ethnography. The advertising agency BMP DDB has taken on board the techniques of ethnography in its "Project Keyhole" in a manner which is reminiscent of anthropologists' practice of living with tribes in order to understand them. Its consumer researchers live with a family for several days in order to record their every move. The project is designed to meet the needs of client companies who are looking for more than the data gathered using traditional quantitative and qualitative research techniques. Participants record their views and actions on a digital video camera, in the presence of a researcher who stays with them from 8am until 10pm for a few days.A normal project would last four or five days and the client may be invited along for part of the time. Participants are paid £100 for their troubles. What did they do with the direct mail when it came through the letter box? Did they use the coupon offer which it contained? Who drinks the fresh orange juice in the house? How long do they spend cooking dinner? How do they actually cook the ready-prepared meals they bought earlier? Does the family eat together? These are examples of the vital information that sponsoring companies hope to get hold of in order to position their products more effectively. According to the company, the advantage of this method over conventional research is that it picks up inconsistencies between what people say they are doing and what they actually do. Following them throughout the day allows the researcher to see why a person's habits might change according to random factors such as their mood, the time of day or the weather. Crucially it reveals the quirks in our behaviour that marketers are desperate to gain an insight into. For example, a person's store-card data might tell you that they buy bread and margarine, but it doesn't tell whether they eat the bread fresh, or toast it first before putting margarine on it. In 1998, the magazine Marketing put this novel research method to the test with a guinea pig family called the Jones's. It then compared the results of this approach with more traditional methods of profiling customers. In short, established systems such as CACI, Claritas and Experian might say one thing about the buying behaviour of a family, using lifestyle and electoral roll data, but did they bear any relation to reality? The information that the researcher gathered in a short space of time told a lot about the Jones family. By contrast, the database information about the Joneses, although detailed and often accurate, could not capture the quirks and details that make up the personality of the family. For example, it transpired that the Joneses had a keener than average eye on value for money. Although information on them from the four database companies correctly suggested that they enjoy luxuries like good food and foreign holidays, it didn't say anything about the real life factors that influence their purchasing decisions. The most noticeable of these was that although they like good food, Mrs Jones mixed her shopping between the supermarket and a local discount store which sells cut-price brands. This means that she only bought at Tesco or Sainsbury's what she could not get cheaper elsewhere. She showed the researcher a can of branded plum tomatoes which she got for 10p at the discount store as an example, explaining that it would have cost 26p in the supermarket. Mrs Jones prided herself on being able to hunt down bargains like this and occasionally rewarded herself by buying "something luxurious", such as smoked salmon from Marks &amp; Spencer. ​</h2><br />
