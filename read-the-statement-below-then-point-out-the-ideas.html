"It was too dark on the trail and I didn't see that pothole until it was too late. I cut my knee when I fell, but I think I can still ride hame." Georgia helped Jenny get back on her bike and said, "Let's stick together this time. I know a shortcut." Georgia arrived home and found her dad outside with a flashlight. "Where have you been 7" He asked, pointing the light towards her. "I was worried sicki She squinted into the bright light and explained that Jenny had gotten hurt.

Do this in your English Notebook.Topic: Phasing out of old jeepneys. As a response, the Traffic Crisis Act, or House Bill (HB) 4334, and the Department of Transportation’s (DOTr) transport modernization program was proposed in congress and government institutions. The program includes jeepney modernization as one of its main parts. The government said that through jeepney modernization there will be higher job demand for the transport sector and it will help in taking care of the environment because it lessened the carbon emissions. On the other hand, some jeepney operators and drivers disagree with jeepney modernization. They said that they are not in favor of this program because of its high cost. An ordinary jeepney operator cannot buy an e-jeepney worth 1.6 to 1.8 million pesos. And if only a few modernized jeepneys are purchased, many jeepney drivers and operators will lose their jobs. Commuters will also be affected. They suffer because it will be hard for them to commute. Moreover, modern jeepneys have higher rates of transportation fees compared with ordinary jeepneys.Answer the following:1. What is your stand on this informed opinion?2. Make a stand and support it with evidence.Deadline: Monday (March 13, 2023)​</a>

Remember, a summary is a brief statement that tells the main ideas of a text. It was a warm summer evening, and Georgia was riding her bike with her best friend Jenny. It was beginning to get dark, and Georgia knew her dad would worry if she stayed out much longer. We should head back," she suggested to Jenny, "we can ride again tomorrow. -Oh, come on!" said Jenny, Let's ride a little farther. We're almost to the old pond. I want to see the fireflies!" she giggled and rode off without waiting for Georgia's reply. "Wait shouted Georgia. You can't go alonel"She jumped back on her bike and quickly sped after Jenny, who was already a speck in the distance. Georgia pedaled faster, trying to keep up with Jenny. It was so dark now that Georgia could barely see the trail . She thought of her dad at home, who would surely be out looking for her. She frowned, thinking how upset he would be that she wasn't home, but she continued riding. She knew Jenny was a strong blcyellst, but she never pald attention to her surroundings and had a knack for getting lost. Georgia was slower, but always knew the way home. Suddenly, Georgia gasped. She saw Jemy lying on the trail up ahead. "Jenny, are you okay?" she asked, jumping off her bike and kneeling next to her friend. "You were right." Jenny sobbed, clutching her knee. "It was too dark on the trail and I didn't see that pothole until it was too late. I cut my knee when I fell, but I think I can still ride hame."

As a response, the Traffic Crisis Act, or House Bill (HB) 4334, and the Department of Transportation’s (DOTr) transport modernization program was proposed in congress and government institutions. The program includes jeepney modernization as one of its main parts. The government said that through jeepney modernization there will be higher job demand for the transport sector and it will help in taking care of the environment because it lessened the carbon emissions. On the other hand, some jeepney operators and drivers disagree with jeepney modernization. They said that they are not in favor of this program because of its high cost. An ordinary jeepney operator cannot buy an e-jeepney worth 1.6 to 1.8 million pesos. And if only a few modernized jeepneys are purchased, many jeepney drivers and operators will lose their jobs. Commuters will also be affected. They suffer because it will be hard for them to commute. Moreover, modern jeepneys have higher rates of transportation fees compared with ordinary jeepneys.Answer the following:1. What is your stand on this informed opinion?2. Make a stand and support it with evidence.Deadline: Monday (March 13, 2023)​</h2><br />

                            16. English Topic: Making a Stand Based on an Informed Opinion Brief Introduction: An informed opinion is a person’s belief, idea, or way of thinking about something based on information gathered. This type of opinion is formed by gathering ideas from different points of view. Example: Having a pet can improve your mood. A stand is a person’s attitude towards a particular issue or opinion. A person’s stand may either support or contradict an idea expressed in an informed opinion. Example: Owning a pet can help reduce stress you are feeling amid the health crisis. According to studies, spending time with your pet can trigger an increased level of oxytocin, also known as the "love hormone." Making a stand means making a firm position in defense or opposition of an informed opinion. You need to support your statement by providing evidence like proof or testimony based on facts. Below is a guide in making a stand: ✓ Study the informed opinion ✓ Decide on your stand ✓ Present your stand ✓ Provide evidence Activity: Directions: Read and analyze the topic below and decide on your stand. Do this in your English Notebook. Topic: Phasing out of old jeepneys. As a response, the Traffic Crisis Act, or House Bill (HB) 4334, and the Department of Transportation’s (DOTr) transport modernization program was proposed in congress and government institutions. The program includes jeepney modernization as one of its main parts. The government said that through jeepney modernization there will be higher job demand for the transport sector and it will help in taking care of the environment because it lessened the carbon emissions. On the other hand, some jeepney operators and drivers disagree with jeepney modernization. They said that they are not in favor of this program because of its high cost. An ordinary jeepney operator cannot buy an e-jeepney worth 1.6 to 1.8 million pesos. And if only a few modernized jeepneys are purchased, many jeepney drivers and operators will lose their jobs. Commuters will also be affected. They suffer because it will be hard for them to commute. Moreover, modern jeepneys have higher rates of transportation fees compared with ordinary jeepneys. Answer the following: 1. What is your stand on this informed opinion? 2. Make a stand and support it with evidence.​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>1. My stand on this informed opinion is against the phasing out of old jeepneys and the implementation of the jeepney modernization program.</p><p></p><p>2. The jeepney modernization program has been proposed as a solution to the traffic crisis and to reduce carbon emissions. However, this program is not feasible for many jeepney operators and drivers due to its high cost. It is unfair for them to bear the burden of the program's expenses, and it will lead to job losses for many. The high transportation fees of modernized jeepneys will also affect commuters, who will have a harder time commuting. Instead of forcing jeepney operators and drivers to bear the brunt of the program, the government should provide financial assistance to help them transition to modernized jeepneys. This will ensure that the jeepney modernization program will not cause undue hardship and job loss for jeepney operators and drivers. Additionally, the government should explore other solutions to the traffic crisis and carbon emissions, such as implementing a more efficient public transportation system, encouraging the use of bicycles and walking, and promoting carpooling.</p><br />
