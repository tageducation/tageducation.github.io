                                             What unforgettable memory can you recall having that involves a property of water?Here are the Properties of Water so you don't have to search about it: Properties of Water1. Water is a Universal Solvent	This means that many substances dissolve in it. Water solvency is a result of its polarity and hydrogen bonding ability of water molecules. For example, when salt (NaCl) or Sodium chloride is placed in water, the negative ends of the water molecules are attracted to the positively charged sodium (Na+) ions and the positive ends of the water molecules are attracted to the negatively charged chloride (Cl-) ions. This attractions causes the sodium and chloride ions to break up or dissociate in water. Why is this important? Since our cells are mostly water, these solutions of ions and molecules allow chemical reactions to occur much more frequently which is an important feature to allow organisms to respond to their environment.2. Water is both Cohesive and Adhesive	Water molecules are also cohesive and adhesive. The hydrogen bonds in water causes water molecules to stick together – a property known as Cohesion. Polar bonds also give molecules an adhesive property or the ability to cling to other polar surfaces. Why is this important? Well, water fills the internal transport systems of plants and animals. Because of these cohesive and adhesive properties, water allows efficient transport of nutrients and waste within an organism.3. Water has High Surface Tension	Water also has high level of surface tension. Because water molecules at the surface are more strongly attracted to each other than to the air above, water molecules cling tightly to each other. The surface tension of water explains why it beads up on waxy surfaces and why water striding insects are able to walk on the surface of water.4. Water has High Heat Capacity	Water has a high capacity for heat. What this means, is that the many hydrogen bonds that link water molecules let water absorb large amount of heat without changing its chemical state, for example, from liquid to gas. It does not only stabilize the temperature of bodies of water such as lakes and oceans but also plays an important role in the physiology of an organism. Since life is based on water and the temperature of water rises and falls slowly, living organisms are better able to maintain their normal internal temperatures and are protected from rapid temperature changes. 5. The Density of Water is based on its Temperature	Unlike any other compounds which contract when they freeze, the configuration of the hydrogen bonds in water causes it to expand when it freezes. This expansion causes ice to have a lower density than liquid water. Therefore, ice floats on liquid water! If ice were denser that liquid water, it would sink and ponds and lake would freeze solid making life there impossible. Instead, bodies of water always freeze from the top down. The ice on the surface acts as an insulator to protect the water below from freezing. This protects organisms so they can survive the winter. ​</a>

Intramolecular forces are attractive coulombic interactions between molecules. One example of
coulombic attraction is in the form of ionic bonding.
Neutral molecules with partial charges can also exhibit attractive forces. They are partly responsible for
the properties associated with particular substances.
3. Let us consider a diatomic compound, say, HF. The electrons are not shared equally between the
atoms H and F. The H end has a partially positive charge while the F has a partially negative charge.
The speed of intermolecular forces determines that state of a substance under a given set conditions.
HF for example is a gas at a room temperature and ordinary pressure.
This discussion on intermolecular forces will revolve around attractive forces that act between atoms or
molecules of pure substance.
Attractive forces that act between polar molecules are called dipole-dipole interactions.
Diatomic molecules made up of elements with significantly different electronegativities like HCI have
partial charges, positive at one end and negative at the other end.
8. Oxygen bonding is a special type of dipole-dipole interaction. Dipole-dipole interaction occurs between
any polar molecules. On the other hand, hydrogen bonding occurs only in molecules that contain H
bonded to a small, highly electronegative atom like F, N and O.
9. Properties of substances depend upon the type of intermolecular forces that hold them together. When
a molecule with a dipole moment gets close to another molecule with a dipole moment too, one dipole
rejects with another dipole.</a>

Scientists study the world by asking questions about it and seeking science-based answers. This method is common to other sciences as well and is often referred to as the scientific method. The scientific method was used in ancient times, but it was first documented by Sir Francis Bacon (1561–1626) of England, who set up inductive methods for scientific investigation. The scientific method can be applied to all fields of study as a reasonable, rational, problem solving technique. The scientific procedure typically starts with an observation that leads to an inquiry. An example of how these components are used is given in the chart below.In this lesson, you will learn concepts about elements and compounds. Remember that substances in matter are broken down into two categories. They can either be pure substances or mixtures. Pure substances are further broken down into elements and compounds. Any substance is composed of one type of atom or molecule. Whereas, mixtures are composed of different types of atoms or molecules that are not chemically bonded.
At the end of the lesson and each learning activity, you will be able to recognize that substances are classified into elements and compounds.
The 100 plus elements in the Periodic Table are the "alphabet" of matter because every tangible material is a combinations of these elements.
The elements are categorized as: Metals, Non-metals, Metalloid and Noble Gases. This main categorization is based on the electrical attributes of the elements. Some elements tend to "lose" an electron, and become positively charged.
(These are the metals), other elements tend to "acquire" an electron, and become negatively charged, (the non-metals). The third group, (metalloids), fall in between these two extremes. And the Noble Gas category -- displays no interest in either acquiring or losing an electron, but unlike the metalloids which can be "persuaded" one way or the other -- the
noble ones simply don't engage.
Since chemical reaction and chemical bonding are electrical in nature, it so happens that members of a certain category can substitute for another member and thereby create a combination which is slightly different, but generally
similar. Say then that by carefully choosing a replacement element in a chemical compound, it is possible to "engineer" a desired slight change in the nature of the compound. This used to be an art, and now is the science of chemistry.</a>

                            6.  What unforgettable memory can you recall having that involves a property of water?Here are the Properties of Water so you don't have to search about it: Properties of Water1. Water is a Universal Solvent	This means that many substances dissolve in it. Water solvency is a result of its polarity and hydrogen bonding ability of water molecules. For example, when salt (NaCl) or Sodium chloride is placed in water, the negative ends of the water molecules are attracted to the positively charged sodium (Na+) ions and the positive ends of the water molecules are attracted to the negatively charged chloride (Cl-) ions. This attractions causes the sodium and chloride ions to break up or dissociate in water. Why is this important? Since our cells are mostly water, these solutions of ions and molecules allow chemical reactions to occur much more frequently which is an important feature to allow organisms to respond to their environment.2. Water is both Cohesive and Adhesive	Water molecules are also cohesive and adhesive. The hydrogen bonds in water causes water molecules to stick together – a property known as Cohesion. Polar bonds also give molecules an adhesive property or the ability to cling to other polar surfaces. Why is this important? Well, water fills the internal transport systems of plants and animals. Because of these cohesive and adhesive properties, water allows efficient transport of nutrients and waste within an organism.3. Water has High Surface Tension	Water also has high level of surface tension. Because water molecules at the surface are more strongly attracted to each other than to the air above, water molecules cling tightly to each other. The surface tension of water explains why it beads up on waxy surfaces and why water striding insects are able to walk on the surface of water.4. Water has High Heat Capacity	Water has a high capacity for heat. What this means, is that the many hydrogen bonds that link water molecules let water absorb large amount of heat without changing its chemical state, for example, from liquid to gas. It does not only stabilize the temperature of bodies of water such as lakes and oceans but also plays an important role in the physiology of an organism. Since life is based on water and the temperature of water rises and falls slowly, living organisms are better able to maintain their normal internal temperatures and are protected from rapid temperature changes. 5. The Density of Water is based on its Temperature	Unlike any other compounds which contract when they freeze, the configuration of the hydrogen bonds in water causes it to expand when it freezes. This expansion causes ice to have a lower density than liquid water. Therefore, ice floats on liquid water! If ice were denser that liquid water, it would sink and ponds and lake would freeze solid making life there impossible. Instead, bodies of water always freeze from the top down. The ice on the surface acts as an insulator to protect the water below from freezing. This protects organisms so they can survive the winter. ​</h2><br />

Intramolecular forces are attractive coulombic interactions between molecules. One example of
coulombic attraction is in the form of ionic bonding.
Neutral molecules with partial charges can also exhibit attractive forces. They are partly responsible for
the properties associated with particular substances.
3. Let us consider a diatomic compound, say, HF. The electrons are not shared equally between the
atoms H and F. The H end has a partially positive charge while the F has a partially negative charge.
The speed of intermolecular forces determines that state of a substance under a given set conditions.
HF for example is a gas at a room temperature and ordinary pressure.
This discussion on intermolecular forces will revolve around attractive forces that act between atoms or
molecules of pure substance.
Attractive forces that act between polar molecules are called dipole-dipole interactions.
Diatomic molecules made up of elements with significantly different electronegativities like HCI have
partial charges, positive at one end and negative at the other end.
8. Oxygen bonding is a special type of dipole-dipole interaction. Dipole-dipole interaction occurs between
any polar molecules. On the other hand, hydrogen bonding occurs only in molecules that contain H
bonded to a small, highly electronegative atom like F, N and O.
9. Properties of substances depend upon the type of intermolecular forces that hold them together. When
a molecule with a dipole moment gets close to another molecule with a dipole moment too, one dipole
rejects with another dipole.</h2><br />

Scientists study the world by asking questions about it and seeking science-based answers. This method is common to other sciences as well and is often referred to as the scientific method. The scientific method was used in ancient times, but it was first documented by Sir Francis Bacon (1561–1626) of England, who set up inductive methods for scientific investigation. The scientific method can be applied to all fields of study as a reasonable, rational, problem solving technique. The scientific procedure typically starts with an observation that leads to an inquiry. An example of how these components are used is given in the chart below.In this lesson, you will learn concepts about elements and compounds. Remember that substances in matter are broken down into two categories. They can either be pure substances or mixtures. Pure substances are further broken down into elements and compounds. Any substance is composed of one type of atom or molecule. Whereas, mixtures are composed of different types of atoms or molecules that are not chemically bonded.
At the end of the lesson and each learning activity, you will be able to recognize that substances are classified into elements and compounds.
The 100 plus elements in the Periodic Table are the "alphabet" of matter because every tangible material is a combinations of these elements.
The elements are categorized as: Metals, Non-metals, Metalloid and Noble Gases. This main categorization is based on the electrical attributes of the elements. Some elements tend to "lose" an electron, and become positively charged.
(These are the metals), other elements tend to "acquire" an electron, and become negatively charged, (the non-metals). The third group, (metalloids), fall in between these two extremes. And the Noble Gas category -- displays no interest in either acquiring or losing an electron, but unlike the metalloids which can be "persuaded" one way or the other -- the
noble ones simply don't engage.
Since chemical reaction and chemical bonding are electrical in nature, it so happens that members of a certain category can substitute for another member and thereby create a combination which is slightly different, but generally
similar. Say then that by carefully choosing a replacement element in a chemical compound, it is possible to "engineer" a desired slight change in the nature of the compound. This used to be an art, and now is the science of chemistry.</h2><br />
