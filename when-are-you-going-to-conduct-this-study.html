                                            What's More Learning Task 3: People tend to be more tolerant of another culture's customs when they understand and learn the meaning behind them. In order to understand an unfamiliar culture, social scientists conduct researches. The best way to do this study is to experience that culture by living with people practicing it. Additionally, this experience should be done for a long period. In this activity, you will be asked to conduct a simple case study examining the culture of other people that is somehow different from yours. If you are an Ilocano, the subject of your study could be people who identify themselves as Tagalog, Bisaya, Bicolano, or other ethnicity. If you know someone who belongs to an indigenous group of people, it is much better to have them as subjects. Since you are not allowed to go out at present because of the threat of COVID-19 pandemic, look for someone who is near to your place or whom you have contact with through social media. Be guided with the following questions as you write your case study: 1. Describe the group of people that you chose. Who are they? What do they do? Where did they come from? What do you know about them?​</a>

                            9. What's More Learning Task 3: People tend to be more tolerant of another culture's customs when they understand and learn the meaning behind them. In order to understand an unfamiliar culture, social scientists conduct researches. The best way to do this study is to experience that culture by living with people practicing it. Additionally, this experience should be done for a long period. In this activity, you will be asked to conduct a simple case study examining the culture of other people that is somehow different from yours. If you are an Ilocano, the subject of your study could be people who identify themselves as Tagalog, Bisaya, Bicolano, or other ethnicity. If you know someone who belongs to an indigenous group of people, it is much better to have them as subjects. Since you are not allowed to go out at present because of the threat of COVID-19 pandemic, look for someone who is near to your place or whom you have contact with through social media. Be guided with the following questions as you write your case study: 1. Describe the group of people that you chose. Who are they? What do they do? Where did they come from? What do you know about them?​</h2><br />

                            10. 263. When are you going to conduct this study?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Pa complete po yung question.. </p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Because we want to find out why and how things are and how they work. Of course, because systematic research has been successful in helping us understand things, it can also focus on very specific, utilitarian questions (how thick does the steel have to be in a bridge? how do we cure cancer? etc). But these depend on earlier fundamental research.
</p><p>
</p><p>Research basically superseded a reliance simply on written or traditional authority. We discovered that asking questions and then looking for ways to answer them in a coherent, logical and evidence-based way.
</p><p>
</p><p>Of course, there are different opinions on what questions are worth asking, and different criteria by discipline as to how you go about examining them. But the explosion in knowledge and understanding from being curious, and not taking authority on trust has been dramatic, despite many false trails and occasional frauds,</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>To advance some area of scientific knowledge; to undercut some other area of scientific knowledge.
</p><p>Because the researchers are really interested in that area of knowledge, think it’s exciting, cool, or even beneficial for humanity.
</p><p>Because the researcher likes the people in that community of researchers and wants to be around them.
</p><p>Because doing research is a good excuse to do other things the researcher likes, such as traveling to exotic locations, hiking around in the forest looking for snails, or digging up pottery and artifacts in the desert.
</p><p>To get knowledge and experience necessary to be a better professional academic teacher.
</p><p>To get knowledge required to develop a product, to sell it, to make money, whatever that’s in turn good for…
</p><p>To make a name/reputation for oneself in an academic or corporate field.
</p><p>To make a name/reputation for the special ideas and methods used in your own professional community. To lead the world to think your approach is legitimate, worth public notice, consequently to qualify for grant money, or to attract status, reputation, purchasing decisions, etc.
</p><p>To accumulate “evidence” that a certain product is effective (that you want to sell or promote), or on the other hand, perhaps harmful (for public benefit, or to profit from a competing product)</p><br />

                            11. when are you going to conduct this study scope and delimitation</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>Scope</strong> and <strong>delimitations</strong> are two elements of a research paper or thesis. The scope of a study explains the extent to which the research area will be explored in the work and specifies the parameters within which the study will be operating. For example, let's say a researcher wants to study the impact of mobile phones on behavior patterns of elementary school children. However, it is not possible for the researcher to cover every aspect of the topic.</p><p></p><p>So the scope will have to be narrowed down to a certain section of the target population. In this case, the scope might be narrowed down to a group of 50 children in grades 3-5 of one specific school. Their behavior patterns in school may have been observed for a duration of 6 months. These would form the delimitations of the study.</p><p></p><p>Thus, delimitations are the characteristics that limit the scope and describe the boundaries of the study, such as the sample size, geographical location or setting in which the study takes place, population traits, etc. Additionally, the researcher might also choose to use some research tools and methodologies to collect data but not others. These delimitations might be imposed for practical reasons, such as lack of time or financial resources to carry out a more thorough investigation. The delimitation section of the study should explain why specific choices were made while others were excluded and how this might affect the outcome of the research.</p><p></p><p>In the example mentioned above, the researcher might state why he/she chose to study a sample population of 50 students, why he/she selected students from Grades 3-5 and not grades 1-2, and why he/she chose students of Billabong Elementary Public School over other schools.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>CTTO HAHA</p><br />

                            18. research study conducted by Torrendon (2017) entitled Difficulties Encountered by the Student Researchers and the Influences on their Research Output revealed that most student researchers have difficulties focus on conflicts in time management. They cannot proceed if most of the time their minds are pre-occupied. When doing a research paper, you must have an enough time to work on. Additionally, having not enough background knowledge is also a factor that affects them since choosing for a research topic will be easy if you have observed well and been listening to the discussions.

                            20. Activity 1: TRANSFORMING LEARNED CONCEPTS
Directions: Answer the following questions intelligently and concisely.
In what way are the qualitative research designs also called qualitative rescarch types?
2. Which aspect of your personality is significantly involved in designing a research
study? Why?
3. What comes into your mind when you think of the word "research design"?
4. Are you going to work on old and new data in grounded theory research design? Why?
Why not?
5. In choosing historical design, what could prevent you from finishing
study?
6. Could an impatient researcher prosper under a phenomenological research design?
Why? Why not?
7. If one of your teachers requires you to do a research following the historical research
design, would you fully agree with him/her on such kind of study? Explain your answer.
8. Does choosing which qualitative research design to follow demand a lot of HOTS?
Give reasons for your answer.
9. Do you know someone who has done a research which was based on one of the
qualitative research designs?
10. If you were to conduct a study, which qualitative research design would you like to
adapt? Justify your answer.</h2><br />
                        <strong>Similar to the way you can group usability testing methods, there are also a number of ways to segment qualitative methods. A popular and helpful categorization separate qualitative methods into five groups: ethnography, narrative, phenomenological, grounded theory, and case study.</strong><strong>Being Determined and confident- this is involved in making a research study since once you finalize your methods and designs implementing it in the real environment will take some justification and the researchers need to have confidence in their research that it will actually be useful and will have a great result.</strong><strong>Research design is considered as a blue prints of the researcher because it gives the whole pictures of the study. it gives complete ingredients to form a well detailed outline thus, it helps the researcher to easily conduct investigation in an easiest way.</strong><strong>Yes,</strong><strong>because you need a qualitative data.As researchers review the data collected, repeated ideas, concepts or elements become apparent, and are tagged with codes, which have been extracted from the data. As more data is collected, and re-reviewed, codes can be grouped into concepts, and then into categories.</strong><strong>Avoid historical designed that cannot give couurage of studying. Must have goal to finish study. Should examine the things that can give inspiration of studying. Give attention to what is really important of studying.</strong><strong>This kind of research design would require conducting of interviews, documentations, and observations since this is a qualitative approach in research. ... Therefore, an impatient researcher cannot withstand this kind of stress the research methods may bring throughout the process. Thus, the researcher will not prosper.</strong><strong>If one teacher of yours requires you to do research following the historical research design, you should fully agree regarding the kind of study being required.Following instructions from teachers may influence your grades,learning subject matter, and correctly executing skills.</strong><strong>Yes,</strong><strong>In choosing a qualitative research design, you need higher order of thinking skills to rationally select the best one that fits you or the group.</strong><strong>This review provides an overview of qualitative methods and designs using examples of research. Note that qualitative researchers frequently employ  several methods in a single study.Basic Qualitative Research </strong><strong>Characteristic.Design</strong><strong> is generally based on a social constructivism perspective.Research problems become research questions based on prior research experience.                                                                                                                          Sample sizes can be as small as one.  Data collection involves interview, observation, and/or archival (content) data.Interpretation is based on a combination of researcher perspective and data collected.</strong><strong>The Research Design that I would like to base on my work is the Phenomenology. Because in Phenomenology because it focuses on understanding human experiences. Also, because it only uses interviews for data collection.</strong><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>hope it helps</p><p>f0ll0w and brainliest me</p><br />

A research study conducted by Torrendon (2017) entitled Difficulties Encountered by the Student Researchers and the Influences on their Research Output revealed that most student researchers have difficulties focus on conflicts in time management. They cannot proceed if most of the time their minds are pre-occupied. When doing a research paper, you must have an enough time to work on. Additionally, having not enough background knowledge is also a factor that affects them since choosing for a research topic will be easy if you have observed well and been listening to the discussions. Lastly, not all of them are having their own media devices that can help them improve their output. There are a lot of ways on how are you going to find those. 
What can you say about the findings of the conducted research of Torrendo?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Finding a good topic is essential to producing quality research output. This can be difficult for student researchers, who may lack the background knowledge to identify good topics. Additionally, time management is crucial for research papers. Student researchers may have difficulty focusing on their work if they are preoccupied with other things. Lastly, having access to media devices can improve research output. However, not all student researchers have their own media devices. The findings of the Torrendo study suggest that these factors can influence the quality of student research output.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Scope and delimitations are two elements of a research paper or thesis. The scope of a study explains the extent to which the research area will be explored in the work and specifies the parameters within which the study will be operating. For example, let's say a researcher wants to study the impact of mobile phones on behavior patterns of elementary school children. However, it is not possible for the researcher to cover every aspect of the topic.</p><p></p><p>So the scope will have to be narrowed down to a certain section of the target population. In this case, the scope might be narrowed down to a group of 50 children in grades 3-5 of one specific school. Their behavior patterns in school may have been observed for a duration of 6 months. These would form the delimitations of the study.</p><p></p><p>Thus, delimitations are the characteristics that limit the scope and describe the boundaries of the study, such as the sample size, geographical location or setting in which the study takes place, population traits, etc. Additionally, the researcher might also choose to use some research tools and methodologies to collect data but not others. These delimitations might be imposed for practical reasons, such as lack of time or financial resources to carry out a more thorough investigation. The delimitation section of the study should explain why specific choices were made while others were excluded and how this might affect the outcome of the research.</p><p></p><p>In the example mentioned above, the researcher might state why he/she chose to study a sample population of 50 students, why he/she selected students from Grades 3-5 and not grades 1-2, and why he/she chose students of Billabong Elementary Public School over other schools.</p><br />
