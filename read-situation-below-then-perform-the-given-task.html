A group of grade 8 students were assigned to perform an activity in their Science class. They were tasked to perform an activity about the Particulate Nature of Solid, Liquid and Gas. They brought with them the materials for the said activity which were: 3 empty small boxes with cover (same size) and marbles. They followed the direction that were given to them by their teacher. The first procedure was to completely fill the first box with marbles. For the second box, they half-fill it with marbles and the third box they place 3 pieces of marbles inside. They cover the three boxes and they make sure that the marbles are sealed tightly in the box. After that they label each box Afor completely filled box with marbles, B- for half-filled box with marbles and C – for 3 pcs of marbles inside the box. After labelling the box, they shake the boxes at the same time. They listen to the sound each box produces.
Questions: 1. What do you think the boxes represent? What do the marbles represent? 2. Which box represents the particle of solid? Why? 3. Which box represents the particle of liquid? Why? 4. Which box represents the particle of gas? Why?</a>

They brought with them the materials for the said activity which were: 3 empty small boxes with cover (same size) and marbles. They followed the direction that were given to them by their teacher. The first procedure was to completely fill the first box with marbles. For the second box, they half-fill it with marbles and the third box they place 3 pieces of marbles inside. They cover the three boxes and they make sure that the marbles are sealed tightly in the box. After that they label each box Afor completely filled box with marbles, B- for half-filled box with marbles and C – for 3 pcs of marbles inside the box. After labelling the box, they shake the boxes at the same time. They listen to the sound each box produces.
Questions: 1. What do you think the boxes represent? What do the marbles represent? 2. Which box represents the particle of solid? Why? 3. Which box represents the particle of liquid? Why? 4. Which box represents the particle of gas? Why?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. the boxes represent solid liquid and gas.and the marbles represent the molecules</p><p>2. box A  because the marbles which is molecules are close together that theres no gaps.</p><p>2. box B because liquid tends to have smaller number of molecules.</p><p>3. box C gas has a little bit molecules only</p><br />

Use short size bond paper/s for your answer. Objective: Solve a real life situation problem(s) involving quadratic equation using any method. Goal: To make a design of the fixture you choose and present to the class together with your teacher, Homeroom PTA Officers and carpenter. Role: You are a fixture Designer. Audience: Teacher, Homeroom PTA Officers, Carpenter Situation: Your teacher adviser was asked by the principal to transfer her Grade 9 class to one of the classrooms of a newly constructed building in your school. The room however, still does not have fixtures like teacher’s table, bulletin board, bookshelf and cabinet. In order for her to acquire such fixtures she initiated to call for a Homeroom PTA Meeting and informed the parents about her classroom needs. The parents decided to donate voluntarily the materials needed, she also asked the students to make the design of the fixtures that will be used by the carpenter in making the fixtures. Product / Performance: Assuming that you are one of the students involved in this undertakings: a) Choose one of the fixtures to be designed. b) Draw the design. c) Illustrate every part of the fixture including the measurement of the dimensions or area. d) Using the design you made, determine all the mathematical concepts and principles. e) Formulate a problem of these mathematical concepts and principles involving quadratic equation(s). f) Determine what are given, what is asked in the problem and the quadratic equation that described the problem(s). g) Solve the quadratic equation that describes the problem(s).​</h2><br />

                            28. LEARNING TASK 5 (2nd Performance Task) Directions: Refer to picture below. Read and analyze the given situation. Answer the guide questions below: GUIDE QUESTIONS: 1. Which layer of atmosphere is rich in ozone? 2. What is the role of the ozone layer? 3. Look at the given illustration. What happens to incoming solar radiation? 4-5. How is the Greenhouse effect related to Global warming and what should we do to minimize its effect?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. <strong>Stratosphere</strong></p><p>2. <strong>Ozone</strong> protects the Earth from harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays from the Sun. Without the Ozone layer in the atmosphere, life on Earth would be very difficult. Plants cannot live and grow in heavy ultraviolet radiation, nor can the planktons that serve as food for most of the ocean life. With a weakening of the Ozone Layer shield, humans would be more susceptible to skin cancer, cataracts and impaired immune systems.</p><p></p><p>3. <strong>Solar radiation</strong> that is not absorbed or reflected by the atmosphere (for example by clouds) reaches the surface of the Earth. The Earth absorbs most of the energy reaching its surface, a small fraction is reflected. In total approximately 70% of incoming radiation is absorbed by the atmosphere and the Earth’s surface while around 30% is reflected back to space and does not heat the surface. The Earth radiates energy at wavelengths much longer than the Sun because it is colder. Part of this long wave radiation is absorbed by greenhouse gases which then radiate energy into all directions, including downwards and thereby trapping heat in the atmosphere. </p><p></p><p>4-5. To stop climate change, we need to stop the amount of greenhouse gases, like carbon dioxide, from increasing. For the past 150 years, burning fossil fuels and cutting down forests, which naturally pull carbon dioxide out of the air, has caused greenhouse gas levels to increase. There are two main ways to stop the amount of greenhouse gases from increasing: we can stop adding them to the air, and we can increase the Earth’s ability to pull them out of the air.</p><p></p><br />
