DIRECTIONS: Read the story below then answer the questions that follow.THE FIRST RAINBOW	One day, Bathala planned a journey to Earth to visit his faithful followers. He called his children to bid them farewell. All of them came but Bighari, the Goddess of Flowers.	Bathala, who valued promptness, became angry because this was not the first time that Bighari missed their gathering. Thus, he banished her from heavenly kingdom.	At that time, Bighari was at her garden on Earth. She wept bitterly when she was told of her banishment, but she sought to cope with her sorrow by causing her garden to bloom profusely.	The legend of the rainbow says that the people that used to live around her garden grew to love her more and more for bringing beauty to their lives. They resolved, after a time, to build her a bower so that they could see her garden even from a long distance. 	And so, they built it. And decked it all over with colorful blooms. Thereafter, whenever Bighari would travel, people would see her colorful bower against the sky.1. Who visited the Earth? __________________________2.

DIRECTIONS: Read the story below then answer the questions that follow.THE FIRST RAINBOW	One day, Bathala planned a journey to Earth to visit his faithful followers. He called his children to bid them farewell. All of them came but Bighari, the Goddess of Flowers.	Bathala, who valued promptness, became angry because this was not the first time that Bighari missed their gathering. Thus, he banished her from heavenly kingdom.	At that time, Bighari was at her garden on Earth. She wept bitterly when she was told of her banishment, but she sought to cope with her sorrow by causing her garden to bloom profusely.	The legend of the rainbow says that the people that used to live around her garden grew to love her more and more for bringing beauty to their lives. They resolved, after a time, to build her a bower so that they could see her garden even from a long distance. 	And so, they built it. And decked it all over with colorful blooms. Thereafter, whenever Bighari would travel, people would see her colorful bower against the sky.1. Who visited the Earth? __________________________2.
