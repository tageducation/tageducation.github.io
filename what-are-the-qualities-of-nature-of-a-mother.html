                                            Write a summary.
Humanity can be defined as quality of being human; the peculiar nature of man, by which he is distinguished from other beings. Being human does not mean that an individual possesses humanity.If you want to understand the quality of humanity in an individual take note of what he does for people who give noting back in return to the favor they have offered.One of the most outstanding examples of extra- ordinary humanity in a human being has been portrayed beautifully by Mother Teresa. Humanity means caring for and helping others whenever and wherever possible. Humanity means helping others at times when they need that help the most, humanity means forgetting your selfish interests at times when others need your help.Serving the poor and the disabled is one of the greatest humanitarian help an individual can provide in his or her lifetime. It is essential to understand the fact that we are extremely lucky to have everything we desire at any point of the time we need. Serving the needy means that you yourself think that you have more than enough resources to your disposal</a>

                            18. Write a summary.
Humanity can be defined as quality of being human; the peculiar nature of man, by which he is distinguished from other beings. Being human does not mean that an individual possesses humanity.If you want to understand the quality of humanity in an individual take note of what he does for people who give noting back in return to the favor they have offered.One of the most outstanding examples of extra- ordinary humanity in a human being has been portrayed beautifully by Mother Teresa. Humanity means caring for and helping others whenever and wherever possible. Humanity means helping others at times when they need that help the most, humanity means forgetting your selfish interests at times when others need your help.Serving the poor and the disabled is one of the greatest humanitarian help an individual can provide in his or her lifetime. It is essential to understand the fact that we are extremely lucky to have everything we desire at any point of the time we need. Serving the needy means that you yourself think that you have more than enough resources to your disposal</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Humanity means that helping others in times whenever and wherever  when they needed help the most.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p> Humanity shows that every character of a person defines their own personality. They tend to help the person who needed help first instead of helping themselves. This is one characteristic of a person that shows love to every human in their community.</p><p></p><br />
