Would you do the same  in neglecting your own brother just because of his wife attitude  and will  why or why not</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The two brothers in the story were Anpu and Bata. Anpu is older than Bata and is already married. Both of them are very loving. Anpu invited his younger brother to live with him and his wife and took care of him until he is old enough to work in the field. Bata on the other hand had served his brother well and has been very grateful to share what he had harvested to his brother and his wife. Their bond as siblings became so strong that even Anpu’s wife got jealous of.
</p><p>Anpu’s wife gets jealous of Bata because she had seen how much he loved him and always sought after his welfare.  
</p><p>The traits of Bata that endeared Anpu more is his dedication and hard work which is incomparable with others. He had the spirit of God with him and always returns home with lots of milk, vegetables, and woods.
</p><p>Anpu’s wife had pretended that she was beaten by Bata by painting her body with blue and black and appeared to be in great pain. She even act as if she cannot give Anpu water to wash his hands, did not light the fire for him, and acts very sick. These acts of Anpu’s wife are disagreeable because telling lies and pretending to be a victim makes others’ lives miserable just like what have happened to Anpu and Bata. Their loving ties have been cut by Anpu’s wife’s jealousy.
</p><p>During the confrontation, Bata fled to the God Ra to spare him from his angry brother Anpu. The God Ra causes a river with crocodiles to flow in between them that Bata might be spared from Anpu’s plan to kill him. Bata asked his older brother why he wanted to kill him despite the fact that he and his wife have been his parents since their parents passed away. Anpu replied that the act is in response to the alleged beating that he had done with his wife.
</p><p>Bata defended himself and repeatedly says that he will never do such a thing since he had looked after her as his own mother. Anpu left Bata and went home. He had discovered that the blue and black on his wife’s skin are just paintings so his anger caused him to kill her instead and cast her to the dogs. His life was filled with mourning for his younger brother. Bata on the other hand, went to the Valley of Acacia and there continue his life.  There he met the nine Gods who gave a woman to be his companion because they do not wanted him to live alone.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            22. The story of the tale of two brothers, if you were anubis, would you believe your wifes explaination? Why? </h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>TALE of Two Brothers - Anpu and Bata</p><p>This story was written for Seti II (1209-1205 B.C.) of the nineteenth Egyptian dynasty. The story repeats a common test which many people had to undergo. It is similar to the story of Joseph in the house of Potiphar, in Genesis 39:1-20. It is reasonable to believe that there were many such scandals in Egypt and in your own hometown. Therefore, borrowing is not required</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Once there were two brethren, of one mother and one father; Anpu was the name of the elder, and Bata was the name of the younger.</p><p> </p><p>Now, as for Anpu, he had a house, and he had a wife. But his little brother was to him, as it were, a son; he it was who made for him his clothes; he it was who followed behind his oxen to the fields; he it was who did the plowing; he it was who harvested the corn; he it was who did for him all the matters which were in the field.</p><p> </p><p>Behold his younger brother grew to be an excellent worker; there was not his equal in the whole land; behold the spirit of a god was in him.</p><p> </p><p>Now after this the younger brother followed his oxen in the daily manner; and every evening he turned again to the house, laden with all the herbs of the field, with milk and with wood, and with all things of the field.</p><p> </p><p>And he put them down before his elder brother who was sitting with his wife; and he drank and ate, and he lay down in his stable with the cattle. And at the dawn of day he took bread which he had baked, and laid it before his elder brother; and he took with him his bread to the field, and he drave his cattle to pasture in the fields.</p><p> </p><p>And as he walked behind his cattle, they said to him, "Good is the herbage which is in that place"; and he listened to all that they said, and he took them to the good place which they desired. And the cattle which were before him were exceeding excellent, and they multiplied greatly.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.Anpu's wife gets jealous of Bata because she had seen how much he loved him and always sought after his welfare.</p><p>2.The wife has planned to destroyed bata the wife paint blue on her face as the bruised on her face so the wife tell anpu was bata hurt her and anpu angry to his brother bata so he planned to put knives in front of the door so bata scared away and after anpu went away the wife wash the paint and anpu saw the wife washed and the anpu can't believe that was she lying to anpu so anpu killed his wife and feed to the stray dogs.I'm not agree because she was a liar,selfish and jealous to bata.</p><p>3.If I were Bata, I would also flee and wait for my brother's head to clear. I won't stay as blood may be drawn and someone might be killed. I would also tell him the truth and explain what actually happened.</p><p>4.No, because her explanation doesn't seem to fit any cases or with what had actually happened.
