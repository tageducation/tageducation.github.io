In the morning,I simply go for walk or jog, drink some coffee or tea,and then get back to work. There's no need for you to have such strenuous work out if you know how to control your balance on what you're eating or doing, except if you want to have a great body figure,and furthermore,I am an introverted person who is like to be alone and will perform my own sort of healthy living.​</a>

To be honest, I like the new grading system but I prefer the old grading system. I am happy to receive the not-so-high grades in the old grading system because it just reflect my performance and in order for me to get high grades, I must really work hard for it. It's my sincere effort, and I don't believe the new grading system works that way either.</p><p></p>New Grading System in the Philippines<p>The<strong> weighted raw score of the students' summative assessments </strong>will serve as the basis for all grades.
