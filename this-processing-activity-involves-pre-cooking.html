The purpose of this activity is to give the correct information about the product. Receiving. This activity includes sorting and grading of raw materials according to size, species, and quality. It also includes segregating suitable from unsuitable ones Packaging. This processing activity involves the wrapping or enclosing food and fish products in bottles or in cans for the purpose of protecting and preserving the finished products Preparation. This includes the preparatory steps such as washing, eviscerating, cutting, brining, and pre-cooking the fish by steaming, blanching, or broiling. Processing/sterilizing. This activity involves the final processing and complete sterilization of the processed finished product. Storing. Storage room is provided for storing finished product such as canned/ bottled fish, smoked fish, salted fish, pickled fish and other processed fishery products. Proper storage will also extend the shelf life of the product.​</a>
