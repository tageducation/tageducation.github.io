                                            Directions: Read and analyze very carefully this sample position paper. Then, accomplish the table by doing what are asked. "DO ANTI-SMOKING AD CAMPAIGNS REALLY HELP? "Yes, we have all seen those scary ads that warn people about horrible consequences smoking can bring. However, according to the official sources, more than fifteen of every 100 people in the United States aged 18 and older smoke today. They, too, see those ads. But they simply do not stop them from this dreadful habit. Or do they? Many politicians and public activists state that anti-smoking ads are effective. And I believe so too. And here is why. First of all, according to the Center of Disease Control and Prevention, the number of smokers dropped significantly in the recent years. "Current smoking has declined from 20.9% (nearly 21 of every 100 adults) in 2005 to 15.5% (more than 15 of every 100 adults) in 2016, they report. And these figures are vivid enough for us to believe that antismoking campaigns really work. Active work in this area has helped many people quit this habit and go back to life with no smoking-related diseases. A lot of smokers oppose such claims and state that ad campaigns against smoking are inefficient. All they do, in their opinion, is scare both smokers and non-smokers and persuade only a small percentage of people with this habit to quit. Is it really worth all the money and time invested in them? I believe so. If even a small number of people can be cured of this habit by trivial ads showing the real consequences of this choice), then it is worth every penny. Another reason why I believe that antismoking ads are effective is that a lot of people did not start smoking despite the peer pressure, stress (which allegedly is relieved by smoking) or any other aspects. When we look at the numbers dropping, we only think of people that quit, and we often forget to take into account those who never started smoking. Seeing ads showing the reality of smoking with the all the negative effect it can have on the body of the one smoking is a powerful tool that can motivate a lot. of people to think twice before taking their first puff.Finally, parents that see such ads get to quit to realizing how dangerous passive smoking is for their kids. And this is a real victory, I believe. Growing up in families with smokers not only gives you the idea that smoking is totally normal but also exposes you to the hazardous effects of smoking at a very young age.To save younger generations from that, antismoking activists create a special sort of campaigns to target this layer of society. And it does work given the dropping numbers of smokers out there.As you see such ads indeed are effective. And even though there still are people who oppose the ideas described in them willing to keep their dangerous habit, I hope that the meaning and hazards of smoking will one day become more obvious to them too.INTRODUCTION•What is the issue about?•Background • Relevance•Thesis statementBODY•Argument•Counter-argument •Evidences presentedCONCLUSION •Restated position •Course of action presented​</a>

Then, write the hook and the thesis statement on the boxes below._____ According to recent reports, cigarette smoking in youth is getting serious. Global Youth Tobacco Survey 2011 (GYTS), a school-based national survey, showed that 13.7 percent of students are currently using tobacco. Although 92 percent of the surveyed schools already included tobacco control in their curriculum, it was not a priority in schools, division offices, and local government units. Thus, the Department of Education (DepEd) called for the effective implementation of a cohesive and comprehensive tobacco control program in schools through a new policy, DepEd Order No. 48, s. 2016._____ However, despite thousands of programs to reduce youth smoking and hundreds of thousands of media stories on the dangers of tobacco use, generation after generation continues to use these deadly products, and family after family continues to suffer the devastating consequences. Ultimately, students should be intensively educated on the harms of tobacco use and health hazards of smoking including giving corrective actions to offenders. This is not only to save them from the “slow death” but to secure the nation’s public and economic health in the future.____ Therefore, DepEd Order No. 48 is a very vital policy, which should be followed and applied to all schools and DepEd offices to completely trash the ash and for everyone to savor a breath of fresh air.____ No surprise, cigarette smoking can literally “take your breath away.” It’s no secret that tobacco has finally been linked to being a bad drug which wreaks havoc on your body. Its avoidance is a general goal but for many years now, the issue on cigarette smoking particularly in schools still hasn’t declined. That’s why we should advocate in educating the youth on the adverse effects of tobacco and make it clear that just starting to smoke can end up giving them lifetime problems.Hook: _____________Thesis Statement: ____________​</a>

                                            DO ANTI-SMOKING AD CAMPAIGNS REALLY HELP? Yes, we have all seen those scary ads that warn people about horrible consequences smoking can bring. However, according to the official sources, more than fifteen of every 100 people in the United States aged 18 and older smoke today. They, too, see those ads. But they simply do not stop them from this dreadful habit. Or do they? Many politicians and public activists state that anti-smoking ads are ef- fective. And I believe so too. And here is why. First of all, according to the Center of Disease Control and Prevention, the number of smokers dropped significantly in the recent years. "Current smoking has declined from 20.9% (nearly 21 of every 100 adults) in 2005 to 15.5% (more than 15 of every 100 adults) in 2016," they report. And these figures are vivid enough for us to believe that antismoking campaigns really work. Active work in this area has helped many people quit this habit and go back to life with no smoking-related diseases. A lot of smokers oppose such claims and state that ad campaigns against smoking are inefficient. All they do, in their opinion, is scare both smokers and non-smokers and persuade only a small percentage of peo- ple with this habit to quit. Is it really worth all the money and time invest- ed in them? I believe so. If even a small number of people can be cured of this habit by trivial ads showing the real consequences of this choice), then it is worth every penny. Another reason why I believe that antismoking ads are effective is that a lot of people did not start smoking despite the peer pressure, stress (which allegedly is relieved by smoking) or any other aspects. When we look at the numbers dropping, we only think of people that quit, and we often forget to take into account those who never started smok- ing. Seeing ads showing the reality of smoking with the all the negative effect it can have on the body of the one smoking is a powerful tool that can motivate a lot of people to think twice before taking their first puff. Week 10: Page 14 of 20 Finally, parents that see such ads get to quit to realizing how dangerous pas- sive smoking is for their kids. And this is a real victory, I believe. Growing up in families with smokers not only gives you the idea that smoking is totally normal but also exposes you to the hazardous effects of smoking at a very young age. To save younger generations from that, antismoking activists create a special sort of campaigns to target this layer of society. And it does work given the dropping numbers of smokers out there. As you see such ads indeed are effective. And even though there still are people who oppose the ideas described in them willing to keep their danger- ous habit, I hope that the meaning and hazards of smoking will one day be- come more obvious to them too. https://chiefessays.net/position-essay-examples-to-help-you-grasp-the-idea/ Guide Questions: 1.

Hazard is an undesirable catastrophe resulting from the forces that are largely beyond human control. 2. Hypocenter is the location on the surface of the Earth directly above where the earthquake starts. Epicenter is the location in the Earth where the earthquake originates. 3. Landslide is the other term for mass wasting. 4. Magnitude measures the energy released by an earthquake while intensity measures the strength of shaking it produces. 5. Surface waves travel through the interior of the Earth. On the other hand, body waves propagate only at the surface of the Earth. 6. The Richter scale is used to rate the intensity of an earthquake while Mercalli Scale measures the magnitude of an earthquake by observing its effect on people and properties. 7. Hazard maps serve as an adaptation planning tool that can support responsible, forward-looking decisions related to any possible disaster threats. 8. Tsunami is an Indonesian term basically caused by undersea earthquakes, landslides on the sea floor, volcanic eruptions and even asteroid impacts. On the other hand, lahar is a Japanese word for mudflows or mixtures of volcanic ash, blocks and water, formed on volcanoes. 9. The higher the lava's silica content, the lower its viscosity. 10. Sandboils are cavities in the ground that form when water erodes an underlying rock layer. 11. Primary waves (P-waves) travel faster, move in a push-pull pattern, travel through solids, liquids and gases, and cause less damage due to their smaller size. Secondary waves (S-waves) travel slower, move in an up-and-down pattern, travel only through solids, and cause more damage due to their greater size. 12. A seismograph is a record written by a seismogram in response to ground motions produced by an earthquake, explosion, or other ground-motion sources. 13. Philippines is just one of the 15 countries situated along the Pacific Spring of Fire. 14. Foreshocks are the energy release and ground shaking after an earthquake. 15. The most abundant volcanic gas is carbon dioxide, which is harmless. ​</a>

"Yes, we have all seen those scary ads that warn people about horrible consequences smoking can bring. However, according to the official sources, more than fifteen of every 100 people in the United States aged 18 and older smoke today. They, too, see those ads. But they simply do not stop them from this dreadful habit. Or do they? Many politicians and public activists state that anti-smoking ads are effective. And I believe so too. And here is why. First of all, according to the Center of Disease Control and Prevention, the number of smokers dropped significantly in the recent years. "Current smoking has declined from 20.9% (nearly 21 of every 100 adults) in 2005 to 15.5% (more than 15 of every 100 adults) in 2016, they report. And these figures are vivid enough for us to believe that antismoking campaigns really work. Active work in this area has helped many people quit this habit and go back to life with no smoking-related diseases. A lot of smokers oppose such claims and state that ad campaigns against smoking are inefficient. All they do, in their opinion, is scare both smokers and non-smokers and persuade only a small percentage of people with this habit to quit. Is it really worth all the money and time invested in them? I believe so. If even a small number of people can be cured of this habit by trivial ads showing the real consequences of this choice), then it is worth every penny. Another reason why I believe that antismoking ads are effective is that a lot of people did not start smoking despite the peer pressure, stress (which allegedly is relieved by smoking) or any other aspects. When we look at the numbers dropping, we only think of people that quit, and we often forget to take into account those who never started smoking. Seeing ads showing the reality of smoking with the all the negative effect it can have on the body of the one smoking is a powerful tool that can motivate a lot. of people to think twice before taking their first puff.Finally, parents that see such ads get to quit to realizing how dangerous passive smoking is for their kids. And this is a real victory, I believe. Growing up in families with smokers not only gives you the idea that smoking is totally normal but also exposes you to the hazardous effects of smoking at a very young age.To save younger generations from that, antismoking activists create a special sort of campaigns to target this layer of society. And it does work given the dropping numbers of smokers out there.As you see such ads indeed are effective. And even though there still are people who oppose the ideas described in them willing to keep their dangerous habit, I hope that the meaning and hazards of smoking will one day become more obvious to them too.INTRODUCTION•What is the issue about?•Background • Relevance•Thesis statementBODY•Argument•Counter-argument •Evidences presentedCONCLUSION •Restated position •Course of action presented​</h2><br />

                            9. Activity 1: YOU’RE MY NUMBER ONEArrange the following paragraphs logically to form the parts of an argumentative essay by putting the numbers 1 to 4 on the space before the textbox. Then, write the hook and the thesis statement on the boxes below._____ According to recent reports, cigarette smoking in youth is getting serious. Global Youth Tobacco Survey 2011 (GYTS), a school-based national survey, showed that 13.7 percent of students are currently using tobacco. Although 92 percent of the surveyed schools already included tobacco control in their curriculum, it was not a priority in schools, division offices, and local government units. Thus, the Department of Education (DepEd) called for the effective implementation of a cohesive and comprehensive tobacco control program in schools through a new policy, DepEd Order No. 48, s. 2016._____ However, despite thousands of programs to reduce youth smoking and hundreds of thousands of media stories on the dangers of tobacco use, generation after generation continues to use these deadly products, and family after family continues to suffer the devastating consequences. Ultimately, students should be intensively educated on the harms of tobacco use and health hazards of smoking including giving corrective actions to offenders. This is not only to save them from the “slow death” but to secure the nation’s public and economic health in the future.____ Therefore, DepEd Order No. 48 is a very vital policy, which should be followed and applied to all schools and DepEd offices to completely trash the ash and for everyone to savor a breath of fresh air.____ No surprise, cigarette smoking can literally “take your breath away.” It’s no secret that tobacco has finally been linked to being a bad drug which wreaks havoc on your body. Its avoidance is a general goal but for many years now, the issue on cigarette smoking particularly in schools still hasn’t declined. That’s why we should advocate in educating the youth on the adverse effects of tobacco and make it clear that just starting to smoke can end up giving them lifetime problems.Hook: _____________Thesis Statement: ____________​</h2><br />

The Richter scale is used to rate the intensity of an earthquake while Mercalli Scale measures the magnitude of an earthquake by observing its effect on people and properties. 7. Hazard maps serve as an adaptation planning tool that can support responsible, forward-looking decisions related to any possible disaster threats. 8. Tsunami is an Indonesian term basically caused by undersea earthquakes, landslides on the sea floor, volcanic eruptions and even asteroid impacts.

Sandboils are cavities in the ground that form when water erodes an underlying rock layer. 11. Primary waves (P-waves) travel faster, move in a push-pull pattern, travel through solids, liquids and gases, and cause less damage due to their smaller size. Secondary waves (S-waves) travel slower, move in an up-and-down pattern, travel only through solids, and cause more damage due to their greater size. 12. A seismograph is a record written by a seismogram in response to ground motions produced by an earthquake, explosion, or other ground-motion sources. 13. Philippines is just one of the 15 countries situated along the Pacific Spring of Fire. 14. Foreshocks are the energy release and ground shaking after an earthquake. 15.
