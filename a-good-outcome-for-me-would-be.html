Read the following narrative essay: 
Jerry was the kind of guy you love to hate. He was always in a good mood and always had something positive to say. When someone would ask him how he was doing, he would reply, "If I were any better, I would be twins!" He was a unique manager because he had several waiters who had followed him around from restaurant to restaurant. The reason the waiters followed Jerry was because of his attitude. He was a natural motivator. If an employee was having a bad day, Jerry was there telling the employee how to look on the positive side of the situation.” (Source: http://examples.yourdictionary.com/narrative-essay-examples.html#eJbghHSKyA7cV5Mm.99)

Read the following narrative essay: 
I can remember my first ascension to a mountain top well. It happened about three years ago, when it was autumn, and the weather in the mountains was gloomy. My friends offered me to travel to the western Carpathian Mountains, and after a short period of hesitation, I accepted their invitation. There was nothing much to do for me at the time, so I thought a change of surrounding would only be of use to me.

Jerry was the kind of guy you love to hate. He was always in a good mood and always had something positive to say. When someone would ask him how he was doing, he would reply, "If I were any better, I would be twins!" He was a unique manager because he had several waiters who had followed him around from restaurant to restaurant. The reason the waiters followed Jerry was because of his attitude. He was a natural motivator. If an employee was having a bad day, Jerry was there telling the employee how to look on the positive side of the situation.” (Source: http://examples.yourdictionary.com/narrative-essay-examples.html#eJbghHSKyA7cV5Mm.99)

Read the following narrative essay: 
I can remember my first ascension to a mountain top well. It happened about three years ago, when it was autumn, and the weather in the mountains was gloomy. My friends offered me to travel to the western Carpathian Mountains, and after a short period of hesitation, I accepted their invitation. There was nothing much to do for me at the time, so I thought a change of surrounding would only be of use to me.

                            6. annalyze this FELT LIKE I WAS TRAPPED IN ONE OF THOSE TERRIFYING nightmares, the one where you have to run, run till your lungs burst, but you can't make your body move fast enough. My legs seemed to move slower and slower as I fought my way through the callous crowd, but the hands on the huge clock tower didn't slow. With relentless, un- caring force, they turned inexorably toward the end-the end of everything.Alice had said there was a good chance we would bothBut this was no dream, and, unlike the nightmare, I wasn't running for my life; I was racing to save something infinitely more precious. My own life meant little to me today.die here. Perhaps the outcome would be different if she weren't trapped by the brilliant sunlight; only I was free to run across this bright, crowded square.And I couldn't run fast enough.So it didn't matter to me that we were surrounded by our extraordinarily dangerous enemies. As the clock began to toll out the hour, vibrating under the soles of my slug- gish feet, I knew I was too late-and I was glad something bloodthirsty waited in the wings. For in failing at this, I forfeited any desire to live.The clock tolled again, and the sun beat down from the exact center point of the sky.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>This passage describes a person who is feeling trapped and panicked as they are running through a crowded square. They have a sense of urgency because they are trying to save something precious, possibly a person or a situation. The person is aware that they are not running fast enough, and the passage uses the metaphor of a clock ticking to emphasize the sense of time running out. The person also mentions that they are surrounded by dangerous enemies. They are aware that they are probably too late and that they are going to die. The person is also willing to die, because the person or situation that they were trying to save is more important than their own life. The passage also mentions Alice and the sunlight which could indicate that the person is trying to save Alice from the dangerous situation.</p><br />
