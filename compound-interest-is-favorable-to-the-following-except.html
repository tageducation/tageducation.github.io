Okay, well, what is a peptide bond? Okay, what is a peptide? A peptide. Is is a compound consistent of two or more amino acids linked in a chain. So if you think about a protein that's made up of many different amino acids all in together, that's a really good example of a peptide made up of, You know, the bonds that hold those individual immuno assets together, which are peptide bond. Okay. And then a peptide bond, um, forms between the car box, old group of one. So I'm gonna draw that in here the car box of a group of one amino acid and the amino group of the other. And then look what happens when we bond those two together water leaves. So that was actually a dehydration reaction, dehydration? Because water is a byproduct that is leaving. Okay. And now we have the Now we have them bonded together, and this forms And am I bond right here this right here is actually an AM. I'd bond.
