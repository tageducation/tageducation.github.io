As the Soviet Union dissolved in 1991, Chechnya​ proclaimed its independence. Late in <strong>1994</strong>, the First <strong>Chechnya​ War broke out</strong>, and two years later, in December 1996, Russian forces withdrew from the region.</p><p><strong>Russia</strong> fought two wars with<strong> Chechnya</strong> between 1994 and 2000. In both wars, <strong>Russia</strong> bombarded <strong>Chechnya</strong> mercilessly, leveling Grozny and killing tens of thousands of civilians. <strong>Russia</strong> launches a massive bombardment assault. Urban areas are reduced to ruins.</p><p>Since 1992, the discussion in <strong>Chechnya</strong> over independence has led to a small-scale civil war in which the <strong>Russians</strong> have attempted secretly to overthrow the government of Dzhokhar Dudayev. 1994 marked the beginning of the<strong> First Chechnya War</strong> when <strong>Russian</strong> soldiers entered <strong>Chechnya</strong> to restore constitutional order.</p><p>Attempts to defeat the <strong>Chechnya</strong> independence movement in post-Soviet <strong>Russia</strong> produced the extraordinarily deadly and savage <strong>First Chechnya War</strong>, which lasted from December 1994 to August 1996. The war concluded with a humiliating defeat for the Russian Armed Forces, but <strong>Chechnya</strong> was also devastated (Hodgson, 2003).</p><p>Estimates of<strong> Second Chechnya War</strong> mortality range significantly from 25,000 to 200,000 civilian deaths and 8,000 to 40,000 Russian military deaths.</p><p></p><p><strong>Learn more about Chechnya War here:</strong></p><p><strong>https://brainly.ph/question/8964745</strong></p><p><strong>#SPJ5</strong></p><br />

Zeus had Hermes hammer the first human woman—Pandora—out of the earth. Hermes made her lovely as a goddess, with the gift of speech to tell lies, and the mind and nature of a treacherous dog. Athena dressed her in silvery clothing and taught her weaving; Hephaestus crowned her with a marvelous golden diadem of animals and sea creatures; Aphrodite poured grace on her head and desire and cares to weaken her limbs.</p><p></p><p>Pandora was to be the first of a race of women, the first bride and a great misery who would live with mortal men as companions only in times of plenty, and desert them when times became difficult. Her name means both "she who gives all gifts" and "she who was given all gifts". Never let it be said that Greeks had any use for women in general.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>hope it helps</p><br />
