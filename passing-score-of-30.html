                        The usual passing score is <strong>24 - 27 out of 30</strong>. 75% or 80% is what is needed to pass a test/exam in 30 points items.<p></p>For example, you get 23 out of 30:<p>You must first determine your grade in percentages. The total number of answers is 30, making it 100%; therefore, we need to divide 30 by 100 to get 0.30, which is 1%.

                            25. 1. In a 50 item test, Phoebe got a score of 30 which is the third Quartile, this meansA. She got the lowest score..C. Her score is higher than 25% of her classmatesB. She surpassed 75% of her classmates. D. 75% of the class did not pass the test.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>C:she surpassed 75%of her classmates</p><p></p><p><strong>Step-by-step explanation:</strong></p><p>So we're given that somebody scored a 50 out of a 70 item test and that's in the third corps tile and we want to know what does it mean when something is in the third quartile. So if we're in the third quartile, you can think about quarters as being divided into four sections. So this would be quartile one To, this would be the third quartile and the 4th quartile over here. I guess I should change that to Roman numeral. So if something is in the third quartile it is at 75%. So that number would be right here And there would be 75% of the data. That would be less than that number. So the correct statement when we're thinking about Um what it means if she scored in the third quartile, it means that she surpassed 75% of the classmates or the other test takers.</p><p></p><br />
