This is in consonance with the findings of variousstudies on bilingualism. McCabe et al., (2013) found a reasonable basis from thegrowing population of bilinguals in the world to affirm that learning using twolanguages does not lead to confusion or difficulty in an academic environment.The mentioned studies zoom in the starting phase of languagedevelopment wherein most factors that affect language learning are externallyproduced or the physical language environment. It can be pointed out that thesituation where a learner is raised and the people who surround him havebearing in the failure or success of language acquisition, training, and learning.Considering these factors beyond the school, the actual teaching-learningenvironment, language teachers indeed have a very serious job to work out.It is undeniable that there is voluminous input available about languageteaching and learning. However, making language learning effective and efficient,considering learners' diversity, personality, behavior, intelligence and otherequally important factorsfactors still remains quite challenging for languageprofessionalsPIVOT 4A CALABARZON23​</a>

Homeschooling versus face to face learning
It isn't that tough task to mark a difference between traditional or virtual learning because in terms of approach both the mediums of education don’t have major differences. The former that is the face to face learning is the basic form of education wherein the students are present in a real classroom physically interacting with the teachers whereas the latter is the virtual or the online education is the one in which the teacher and the student interact and establish a connection via the internet. The entire coursework  syllabus examinations etc. all remain the same.
Now the question is which education system is the better or which one overshadows the other one. If we look in the current scenario online education today is the need of the hour. However one cannot also brush off the fact that there is an immense shortage of good premium schools where children are taught the fundamentals of education. When they pass out of good institutions their entire personality and their vision are transformed. Especially in underdeveloped countries there is a high scarcity of developed and advanced schools. Not only this but cost also creates hindrances and it `s one of the biggest hurdles in the path of children which eventually deprives them of education. In fact it is one of the biggest factors why online education is much preferred than traditional school education. The lower and the middle-class students are left stranded just because their guardians just cannot afford to pay high tuition fees.
In homeschooling it`s the parents who take the responsibility of educating their children. Irrespective of whether they are qualified or not to teach their children parents to take the responsibility of educating their children with whatever little knowledge or means they have. For these children online education has arisen as a ray of hope. In the online education the students just by using a computer and an internet connection are connected with subject expert teachers who offer them guidance and mentorship in their studies.</a>

Homeschooling versus face to face learning
It isn't that tough task to mark a difference between traditional or virtual learning because in terms of approach both the mediums of education don’t have major differences. The former that is the face to face learning is the basic form of education wherein the students are present in a real classroom physically interacting with the teachers whereas the latter is the virtual or the online education is the one in which the teacher and the student interact and establish a connection via the internet. The entire coursework  syllabus examinations etc. all remain the same.
Now the question is which education system is the better or which one overshadows the other one. If we look in the current scenario online education today is the need of the hour. However one cannot also brush off the fact that there is an immense shortage of good premium schools where children are taught the fundamentals of education. When they pass out of good institutions their entire personality and their vision are transformed. Especially in underdeveloped countries there is a high scarcity of developed and advanced schools. Not only this but cost also creates hindrances and it `s one of the biggest hurdles in the path of children which eventually deprives them of education. In fact it is one of the biggest factors why online education is much preferred than traditional school education. The lower and the middle class students are left stranded just because their guardians just cannot afford to pay high tuition fees.
In homeschooling it`s the parents who take the responsibility of educating their children. Irrespective of whether they are qualified or not to teach their children parents to take the responsibility of educating their children with whatever little knowledge or means they have. For these children online education has arisen as a ray of hope. In the online education the students just by using a computer and an internet connection are connected with subject expert teachers who offer them guidance and mentorship in their studies.</a>

This is in consonance with the findings of variousstudies on bilingualism. McCabe et al., (2013) found a reasonable basis from thegrowing population of bilinguals in the world to affirm that learning using twolanguages does not lead to confusion or difficulty in an academic environment.The mentioned studies zoom in the starting phase of languagedevelopment wherein most factors that affect language learning are externallyproduced or the physical language environment. It can be pointed out that thesituation where a learner is raised and the people who surround him havebearing in the failure or success of language acquisition, training, and learning.Considering these factors beyond the school, the actual teaching-learningenvironment, language teachers indeed have a very serious job to work out.It is undeniable that there is voluminous input available about languageteaching and learning. However, making language learning effective and efficient,considering learners' diversity, personality, behavior, intelligence and otherequally important factorsfactors still remains quite challenging for languageprofessionalsPIVOT 4A CALABARZON23​</h2><br />

Homeschooling versus face to face learning
It isn't that tough task to mark a difference between traditional or virtual learning because in terms of approach both the mediums of education don’t have major differences. The former that is the face to face learning is the basic form of education wherein the students are present in a real classroom physically interacting with the teachers whereas the latter is the virtual or the online education is the one in which the teacher and the student interact and establish a connection via the internet. The entire coursework  syllabus examinations etc. all remain the same.
Now the question is which education system is the better or which one overshadows the other one. If we look in the current scenario online education today is the need of the hour. However one cannot also brush off the fact that there is an immense shortage of good premium schools where children are taught the fundamentals of education. When they pass out of good institutions their entire personality and their vision are transformed. Especially in underdeveloped countries there is a high scarcity of developed and advanced schools. Not only this but cost also creates hindrances and it `s one of the biggest hurdles in the path of children which eventually deprives them of education. In fact it is one of the biggest factors why online education is much preferred than traditional school education. The lower and the middle-class students are left stranded just because their guardians just cannot afford to pay high tuition fees.
In homeschooling it`s the parents who take the responsibility of educating their children. Irrespective of whether they are qualified or not to teach their children parents to take the responsibility of educating their children with whatever little knowledge or means they have. For these children online education has arisen as a ray of hope. In the online education the students just by using a computer and an internet connection are connected with subject expert teachers who offer them guidance and mentorship in their studies.</h2><br />

Homeschooling versus face to face learning
It isn't that tough task to mark a difference between traditional or virtual learning because in terms of approach both the mediums of education don’t have major differences. The former that is the face to face learning is the basic form of education wherein the students are present in a real classroom physically interacting with the teachers whereas the latter is the virtual or the online education is the one in which the teacher and the student interact and establish a connection via the internet. The entire coursework  syllabus examinations etc. all remain the same.
Now the question is which education system is the better or which one overshadows the other one. If we look in the current scenario online education today is the need of the hour. However one cannot also brush off the fact that there is an immense shortage of good premium schools where children are taught the fundamentals of education. When they pass out of good institutions their entire personality and their vision are transformed. Especially in underdeveloped countries there is a high scarcity of developed and advanced schools. Not only this but cost also creates hindrances and it `s one of the biggest hurdles in the path of children which eventually deprives them of education. In fact it is one of the biggest factors why online education is much preferred than traditional school education. The lower and the middle class students are left stranded just because their guardians just cannot afford to pay high tuition fees.
In homeschooling it`s the parents who take the responsibility of educating their children. Irrespective of whether they are qualified or not to teach their children parents to take the responsibility of educating their children with whatever little knowledge or means they have. For these children online education has arisen as a ray of hope. In the online education the students just by using a computer and an internet connection are connected with subject expert teachers who offer them guidance and mentorship in their studies.</h2><br />
