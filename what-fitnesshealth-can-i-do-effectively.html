STRESSDo you think that stress is always something negative? Actually, stress can either be negative or positive!STRESS is defined as the physiological (or physical) and emotional responses to a significant or unexpected change or disruption in one’s life (Payne, et al., 2005).It may also refer to “what you feel when you react to pressure, either from the outside world (school, family, friends) or from yourself i.e. wanting to do fit in, wanting to do well in school.The word STRESSOR refers to the things that make a person stressed. There are two different kinds of stress – eustress and distress.EUSTRESS refers to a positive and healthy response of the body from a stressor. It produces good effects to one’s well-being. For example, a person, who studied for long hours then took and got an outstanding grade in the exam, may feel happiness and enjoyment.On the other hand, DISTRESS refers to negative reaction of the body towards a given stressor. It may cause problems in health, alter the mood and emotions, and even affect the way a person thinks. For example, when a person woke up late for work, he or she may feel anger and disappointment.Lesson 1STRESSWhat I KnowP__ __S__C__LE__V__ __ __NM __N __ __LE__ __T__ __N__LM__R__L - S __ __R __ __ __ __LM__ __T__LS__ C__ __​</a>
