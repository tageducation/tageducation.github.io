Although the bus companies were losing a lot of money, the city officials did not give in to the demands of the black citizens.</p><p></p><p>5.Rosa’s refusal to follow an unjust law was not disregarded though. Thirteen months after the boycott started, the U.S. Supreme Court declared that the segregation in public transportation was unconstitutional. In 1964, the U.S. Congress passed a law known as the “Civil Rights Act of 1964” that put an end to racial discrimination in the country. </p><p>6.The bravery shown by Rosa Park that night proved to be a transformative move for the American people.</p><p></p><p>Explanation:</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>YES,Racial discrimination is a serious human rights problem in the United States that intersects with all of the US domestic issues covered by Human Rights Watch—from over-incarceration of Black and Latinx people fueled by the disproportionately harsh sentences meted out for all categories of crime, including violent offenses, to the failed War on Drugs, to prosecution and bail policies that coerce people into guilty pleas, to surveillance of specific groups, such as Muslims or political activists from other ethnic or religious minorities, to immigration policies that scapegoat immigrants as criminals, or subject asylum seekers and refugees to disparate treatment based on their national origin. Human Rights Watch documents, investigates, and analyzes human rights abuses involving racial discrimination in “purpose or effect,” meaning violations that result in racial disparities even without intent to discriminate, and we advocate for the US to meet its international human rights obligation to end all forms of racial discrimination.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Learning Task 3</p><p>1. Racial Discrimination means any discrimination against any individual on the basis of their skin color, or racial or ethnic origin. Racial Discrimination in America shown before 1964 was inhumane by not giving them equality/rights that white persons have in their time.</p><p></p><p>2. Rosa Park is a brave woman.</p><p>Evidence: Rosa and the bus driver had an argument about not giving her seat to a white person. </p><p>Evidence: Rosa's refusal to follow an unjust law.</p><p></p><p>3. Yes i think it's right for Rosa to refuse to follow the law that time because the U.S congress would not make a new law for racial discrimination and thanks to Rosa Civil Rights Acts of 1964 passed.</p><p></p><p>4. Yes it does until now. For examples are disability discrimination, sexual orientation, age discrimination and national origin are some examples of discrimination happens around the globe. </p><p></p><p>5. Well I will surely help them from people who treat them unjustify by standing up for them or depend them from criticism.</p><br />
