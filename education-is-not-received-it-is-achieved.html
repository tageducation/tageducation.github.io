                                            Read the essay in the box and do what is asked.Some people believe that everyone needs a college degree. Educationis important, but I don’t think a four-year university education is needed tobe successful in our society.Electricians, plumbers, and carpenters go through specialized trainingin their fields. They don’t need to be college graduates to do their work.Blue-collar workers are the backbones of our society. Where would we be ifno one took vocational training? Who would repair our cars and unclog oursinks? The college-educated professional won’t do it. Unskilled work isimportant too. Dishwashers and taxi drivers may not have even a highschool education, but many people rely on the services they provide.On the other hand, a practical education combined with college coursesin business administration might mean the difference between being anelectrician and owning a successful electrical contracting business. BillGates is a good example. He started building computers from kits when hewas in high school. He went to Harvard for a while, but he dropped out sothat he could pursue his own idea of creating an operating system forpersonal computers. He invented DOS (disk operating system) andfounded Microsoft.In conclusion, people should have a chance to receive the highestlevel of education that their potential and effort allow. It’s great to havesome college experience, because it exposes you to new people andideas, but it is not necessary for everyone to receive a four-year universityeducation.Source: Literature.

                                            Additional Activities Read the article below. Note the main ideas and supporting details. Developing Children's Self Esteem Adeluisa S. Calma People who feel good about themselves embrace the fact that they may make positive contributions to their company, community, school, or any other "cause" greater than themselves, according to psychologists. Children come to respect their own contributions to the family's teamwork by becoming a member of the family organization and understanding that their feelings and views are respected. A child's self-worth is shaped by the overall environment of the home and how the family members treat the child. Fostering a positive home environment and well-functioning family can be achieved by building a family environment of shared support and motivation for each family member Rather than nagging or comparing their children, parents should educate, listen, and collaborate with them. This will foster a deep sense of belongingness and collaboration. Parents must recognize that their adolescent children are fighting their own wars. Their self- confidence is shaky. They crave attention from their peers in order to receive the love and affection they deserve. And if they are often confusing, they are still respected members of the family. They must participate, relate, and comprehend their parents' beliefs. Mutual agreements should be made between family members, so everyone knows what is expected of them. Instead of being authoritarian, parents must be leaders. They should provide leadership so that their children will learn to be more self-sufficient; listen to the children's thoughts and feelings with empathy and sympathy. Taking time for problem solving teaches values while it expresses love and concern. And lastly, it is important to value family traditions. Family rituals build belongingness, self-image and competence when everyone contributes to it. These are special occasions such as marriages, baptisms, and graduations. A family that lives time-honored tradition builds real strength and closeness. The deeper its roots go; the happier members feel about themselves and their self-esteem rises. As a result, foster a sense of self- esteem in your household. Task 1: Present the author's claim and evidences using a graphic organizer. Evidence Claim Task 2: Refer to your answer on Task 1.

                            14. Read the essay in the box and do what is asked.Some people believe that everyone needs a college degree. Educationis important, but I don’t think a four-year university education is needed tobe successful in our society.Electricians, plumbers, and carpenters go through specialized trainingin their fields. They don’t need to be college graduates to do their work.Blue-collar workers are the backbones of our society. Where would we be ifno one took vocational training? Who would repair our cars and unclog oursinks? The college-educated professional won’t do it. Unskilled work isimportant too. Dishwashers and taxi drivers may not have even a highschool education, but many people rely on the services they provide.On the other hand, a practical education combined with college coursesin business administration might mean the difference between being anelectrician and owning a successful electrical contracting business. BillGates is a good example. He started building computers from kits when hewas in high school. He went to Harvard for a while, but he dropped out sothat he could pursue his own idea of creating an operating system forpersonal computers. He invented DOS (disk operating system) andfounded Microsoft.In conclusion, people should have a chance to receive the highestlevel of education that their potential and effort allow. It’s great to havesome college experience, because it exposes you to new people andideas, but it is not necessary for everyone to receive a four-year universityeducation.Source: Literature.

                            15. Additional Activities Read the article below. Note the main ideas and supporting details. Developing Children's Self Esteem Adeluisa S. Calma People who feel good about themselves embrace the fact that they may make positive contributions to their company, community, school, or any other "cause" greater than themselves, according to psychologists. Children come to respect their own contributions to the family's teamwork by becoming a member of the family organization and understanding that their feelings and views are respected. A child's self-worth is shaped by the overall environment of the home and how the family members treat the child. Fostering a positive home environment and well-functioning family can be achieved by building a family environment of shared support and motivation for each family member Rather than nagging or comparing their children, parents should educate, listen, and collaborate with them. This will foster a deep sense of belongingness and collaboration. Parents must recognize that their adolescent children are fighting their own wars. Their self- confidence is shaky. They crave attention from their peers in order to receive the love and affection they deserve. And if they are often confusing, they are still respected members of the family. They must participate, relate, and comprehend their parents' beliefs. Mutual agreements should be made between family members, so everyone knows what is expected of them. Instead of being authoritarian, parents must be leaders. They should provide leadership so that their children will learn to be more self-sufficient; listen to the children's thoughts and feelings with empathy and sympathy. Taking time for problem solving teaches values while it expresses love and concern. And lastly, it is important to value family traditions. Family rituals build belongingness, self-image and competence when everyone contributes to it. These are special occasions such as marriages, baptisms, and graduations. A family that lives time-honored tradition builds real strength and closeness. The deeper its roots go; the happier members feel about themselves and their self-esteem rises. As a result, foster a sense of self- esteem in your household. Task 1: Present the author's claim and evidences using a graphic organizer. Evidence Claim Task 2: Refer to your answer on Task 1.
