Beowulf’s fight with the dragon constitutes the third and final part of the epic.</p><p></p><p>Other Danes</p><p></p><p>Shield Sheafson</p><p></p><p>The legendary Danish king from whom Hrothgar is descended, Shield Sheafson is the mythical founder who inaugurates a long line of Danish rulers and embodies the Danish tribe’s highest values of heroism and leadership.

Beow is the son of Shield Sheafson and father of Halfdane. The narrator presents Beow as a gift from God to a people in need of a leader. He exemplifies the maxim, “Behavior that’s admired / is the path to power among people everywhere” (24–25).</p><p></p><p>Halfdane</p><p></p><p>The father of Hrothgar, Heorogar, Halga, and an unnamed daughter who married a king of the Swedes, Halfdane succeeded Beow as ruler of the Danes.</p><p></p><p>Wealhtheow</p><p></p><p>Hrothgar’s wife, the gracious queen of the Danes.</p><p></p><p>Unferth</p><p></p><p>A Danish warrior who is jealous of Beowulf, Unferth is unable or unwilling to fight Grendel, thus proving himself inferior to Beowulf.</p><p>Read an in-depth analysis of Unferth.</p><p></p><p>Hrethric</p><p></p><p>Hrothgar’s elder son, Hrethric stands to inherit the Danish throne, but Hrethric’s older cousin Hrothulf will prevent him from doing so.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Beowulf is a fictional prince of the Geats of southern Sweden who comes to Denmark to help King Hrothgar rid his fabulous hall, Heorot, of a terrible monster known as Grendel. ... Beowulf tracks her down and kills her, then returns to Heorot, where he receives great honors and gifts before returning home.</p><p></p><p>King Hrothgar</p><p></p><p>Hrothgar enjoys military success and prosperity until Grendel terrorizes his realm. A wise and aged ruler, Hrothgar represents a different kind of leadership from that exhibited by the youthful warrior Beowulf. He is a father figure to Beowulf and a model for the kind of king that Beowulf becomes.</p><p></p><p>Grendel is feared by all in Heorot but Beowulf. A descendant of Cain, Grendel is described as "a creature of darkness, exiled from happiness and accursed of God, the destroyer and devourer of our human kind".</p><p></p><p>Grendel's mother is as fierce as her son and seems even more vindictive. She is determined to get revenge for her son's death, thus exhibiting a strong maternal instinct. She too, is a descendent of Cain, the first murderer mentioned in the Bible. Thus, she is immediately connected with evil.</p><p></p><p>Wiglaf, one of Beowulf's kinsmen and thanes, is the only warrior brave enough to help the hero in his fight against the dragon. In this regard, Wiglaf appears as a reflection of the young Beowulf in the first part of the story—a warrior who is strong, fearless, valiant, and loyal. ...</p><p></p><p>Explanation: MIC DROP</p><br />

                        CHARACTER OF BEOWULF<br />Beowulf, Hrothgar, Grendel, Grendel's mother, the dragon, Unferth, Wealhtheow, and Wiglaf are the principal characters. Hrothgar, king of the Danes, is one of the most essential characters because he encourages Beowulf and attempts to help him become a better man.<br />SIGNIFICANT DETAILS ABOUT THE CHARACTER<br />- Beowulf<br />Beowulf, the protagonist of the epic, is a Geatish hero who battles the monster Grendel, Grendel's mother, and a dragon that breathes fire. Beowulf's boasts and experiences prove him to be the most powerful and skilled fighter in the area. In his youth, he embodies all of the most admirable characteristics of the heroic culture. In his senior years, he proves to be a smart and successful leader.<br />- King Hrothgar<br />The king of Denmark. Until Grendel terrorizes his realm, Hrothgar enjoys military success and affluence. Hrothgar, a wise and elderly monarch, depicts a different style of leadership than the young warrior Beowulf. He serves as a father figure to Beowulf and a role model for the type of monarch Beowulf will become.<br />- Grendel<br />Grendel, a demon descended from Cain, preys on Hrothgar's warriors in Heorot, the king's mead hall. Grendel's vicious and terrible existence is part of God's revenge for Cain's murder of Abel. Therefore he fits perfectly into the worldview of vengeance that dominates the poem.<br />- Mother of Grendel<br />Grendel's mother, an unidentified swamp witch, had fewer human characteristics than her son, although her terrorization of Heorot is motivated by a human desire for vengeance.<br />- The Dragon<br />The dragon, an ancient and strong reptile, protects a treasure cache in a secret mound. The battle between Beowulf and the dragon is the third and last section of the epic.<br />- Protect Sheafson<br />Shield Sheafson, the fabled king of Denmark from whom Hrothgar is descended, is the mythological founder who inaugurates a long series of Danish monarchs and exemplifies the Danish tribe's best virtues of valor and leadership.<br />- Beow<br />The second king is featured in the poem's introductory genealogy of Danish rulers. Beow is the father of Halfdane and the son of Shield Sheafson. Beow is described by the narrator as a gift from God to a nation in need of a leader. He epitomizes the adage that "admired behavior is the way to power among all people".<br />- Halfdane<br />Halfdane succeeded Beow as king of the Danes. He was the father of Hrothgar, Heorogar, Halga and an unknown daughter who wed a Swedish king.<br />- Hrethric<br />Hrethric, the eldest son of Hrothgar, is in line to inherit the Danish crown, but his cousin Hrothulf will prevent him from doing so. Beowulf offers to facilitate the youth's ascension to the throne by housing and advising him in Geatland.<br />- Hrothulf<br />Hrothulf, the nephew of Hrothgar, betrays and usurps his cousin Hrethic, the legitimate successor to the throne of Denmark. Hrothulf's treachery stands in contrast to Beowulf's dedication to Hygelac in aiding his son's ascension to the throne.<br />- Hygd<br />Queen of the Geats; wife of Hygd Hygelac; young, handsome, and intellectual. The comparison between Hygd and Queen Modthryth is made.<br />- Wiglaf<br />Beowulf's youthful kinsman and retainer aid him in the battle against the dragon as the other warriors flee. Wiglaf demonstrates greater adherence to the heroic ethic than any of Beowulf's other retainers, showing his suitability as Beowulf's successor.<br />- Ecgtheow<br />Ecgtheow is the father of Beowulf, the brother-in-law of Hygelac, and Hrothgar's companion. Ecgtheow is deceased when the story begins, but he lives on in his son's remembrances and via the honorable reputation he earned throughout his lifetime.<br />- Breca<br />Beowulf's childhood pal Breca, whom he defeated in a swimming competition. Unferth alludes to the tale of their contest, and Beowulf proceeds to describe it in detail.<br />- Sigemund<br />A legendary Norse figure is renowned for defeating a monster. Beowulf is praised in Sigemund's tale, which also foreshadows Beowulf's meeting with the dragon.<br />- Princess Modthryth<br />A legendary queen who punishes anyone who looks at her improperly. The purpose of sharing Modthryth's narrative is to contrast her ruthlessness with Hygd's compassionate and sensible actions.<br />REPRESENTATION OF THE CHARACTER IN THE PRESENT SOCIETY<br />- BEOWULF: Our national hero, like Jose Rizal.<br />- KING HROTHGAR: King Solomon was renowned for his sageness.<br />- GRENDEL: Something horrible and demonic, such as criminals or murderers.<br />- GRENDEL'S MOTHER: Represent the military strategist. In actuality, a country still in battle represents her as being in a state of war.<br />- WIGLAF: symbolize valor and fidelity; our hospital's physicians exemplified these qualities.<br />- THE DRAGON: The dragon in Beowulf represents avarice. Thus, dragons may be comparable to those who cause us harm<br />

Beowulf uses his epic strength and bravery to slay Grendel in Hrothgar’s mead hall, Heorot, and then to slay Grendel’s vengeful mother in her underwater lair. Beowulf’s fame spreads, and he returns home to Geatland laden with treasure for his king, Hygelac. Beowulf later becomes the king of the Geats and rules for a peaceful fifty years. When a dragon begins to pose a threat to Geatland, Beowulf and his servant Wiglaf set off to defeat it. Beowulf succeeds in slaying the dragon, but dies in the process.<br /><br /><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Factors that make Beowulf an epic poem are that it is a book-length poem in verse, focuses on a single hero, includes battles or conflicts, reflects many aspects of its culture, is lofty in language, and features a tragic death.</p><br />

                        <p>1. <strong>Beowulf </strong>- The protagonist of the tale, Beowulf, is a Geatish hero who faces up against a fire-breathing dragon, the monster Grendel, and Grendel's mother. Beowulf is the region's strongest and most adept warrior, as shown by his boasts and encounters. In his youth, he personified every virtue of the heroic culture. Despite his late age, he is still a wise and capable leader.</p><p></p><p>2. <strong>Grendel </strong>- In Heorot, the king's mead hall, Grendel, a demon descended from Cain, preys on Hrothgar's troops.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Beowulf is a fictional prince of the Geats of southern Sweden who comes to Denmark to help King Hrothgar rid his fabulous hall, Heorot, of a terrible monster known as Grendel. ... Beowulf tracks her down and kills her, then returns to Heorot, where he receives great honors and gifts before returning home.
</p><p>
</p><p>King Hrothgar
</p><p>
</p><p>Hrothgar enjoys military success and prosperity until Grendel terrorizes his realm. A wise and aged ruler, Hrothgar represents a different kind of leadership from that exhibited by the youthful warrior Beowulf. He is a father figure to Beowulf and a model for the kind of king that Beowulf becomes.
</p><p>
</p><p>Grendel is feared by all in Heorot but Beowulf. A descendant of Cain, Grendel is described as "a creature of darkness, exiled from happiness and accursed of God, the destroyer and devourer of our human kind".
</p><p>
</p><p>Grendel's mother is as fierce as her son and seems even more vindictive. She is determined to get revenge for her son's death, thus exhibiting a strong maternal instinct. She too, is a descendent of Cain, the first murderer mentioned in the Bible. Thus, she is immediately connected with evil.
</p><p>
</p><p>Wiglaf, one of Beowulf's kinsmen and thanes, is the only warrior brave enough to help the hero in his fight against the dragon. In this regard, Wiglaf appears as a reflection of the young Beowulf in the first part of the story—a warrior who is strong, fearless, valiant, and loyal. </p><p><strong>Explanation: I hope its helpful</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>CHARACTER OF BEOWULF</strong></p><p><strong>Beowulf</strong>, Hrothgar, Grendel, Grendel's mother, the dragon, Unferth, Wealhtheow, and Wiglaf are <strong>the principal characters</strong>. Hrothgar, king of the Danes, is one of the most essential characters because he encourages <strong>Beowulf </strong>and attempts to help him become a better man.</p><p></p><p><strong>SIGNIFICANT DETAILS ABOUT THE CHARACTER </strong></p><p><strong>- Beowulf</strong></p><p><strong>Beowulf</strong>, the protagonist of the epic, is a Geatish hero who battles the monster Grendel, <strong>Grendel's mother</strong>, and a dragon that breathes fire. <strong>Beowulf</strong>'s boasts and experiences prove him to be the most powerful and skilled fighter in the area. In his youth, he <strong>embodies</strong> all of the most admirable characteristics of the heroic culture. In his senior years, he proves to be a smart and successful leader.</p><p><strong>- King Hrothgar</strong></p><p>The king of Denmark. Until Grendel terrorizes his realm,<strong> Hrothgar </strong>enjoys military success and affluence. Hrothgar, a wise and elderly monarch, depicts a different style of leadership than the young warrior Beowulf. He serves as <strong>a father figure</strong> to Beowulf and a role model for the type of monarch Beowulf will become.</p><p><strong>- Grendel</strong></p><p>Grendel, a <strong>demon descended from Cain</strong>, preys on Hrothgar's warriors in Heorot, the king's mead hall. Grendel's vicious and terrible existence is part of God's revenge for Cain's murder of Abel. Therefore he fits perfectly into the worldview of vengeance that dominates the poem.</p><p><strong>- Mother of Grendel</strong></p><p><strong>Grendel's mother</strong>, an unidentified swamp witch, had fewer human characteristics than her son, although her terrorization of Heorot is motivated by a human desire for vengeance.</p><p><strong>- The Dragon</strong></p><p><strong>The dragon</strong>, an ancient and strong reptile, protects a treasure cache in a secret mound. <strong>The battle</strong> between Beowulf and the dragon is the third and last section of the epic.</p><p><strong>- Protect Sheafson</strong></p><p>Shield Sheafson, <strong>the fabled king of Denmark</strong> from whom Hrothgar is descended, is the mythological founder who inaugurates a long series of Danish monarchs and exemplifies the Danish tribe's best virtues of valor and leadership. </p><p><strong>- Beow</strong></p><p>The second king is featured in the poem's introductory genealogy of Danish rulers.<strong> Beow</strong> is the father of Halfdane and the son of Shield Sheafson.<strong> Beow </strong>is described by the narrator as a gift from God to a nation in need of a leader. He epitomizes the adage that "admired behavior is the way to power among all people".</p><p><strong>- Halfdane</strong></p><p>Halfdane succeeded Beow as king of the Danes. He was the father of Hrothgar, Heorogar, Halga and an unknown daughter who wed a Swedish king.</p><p><strong>- Hrethric</strong></p><p><strong>Hrethric</strong>, the eldest son of <strong>Hrothgar</strong>, is in line to inherit the Danish crown, but his cousin Hrothulf will prevent him from doing so. <strong>Beowulf</strong> offers to facilitate the youth's ascension to the throne by housing and advising him in Geatland.</p><p><strong>- Hrothulf</strong></p><p>Hrothulf, <strong>the nephew of Hrothgar</strong>, betrays and usurps his cousin Hrethic, the legitimate successor to the throne of Denmark. Hrothulf's treachery stands in contrast to Beowulf's dedication to <strong>Hygelac</strong> in aiding his son's ascension to the throne.</p><p><strong>- Hygd</strong></p><p>Queen of the Geats; wife of Hygd Hygelac; young, handsome, and intellectual. The comparison between <strong>Hygd</strong> and Queen Modthryth is made.</p><p><strong>- Wiglaf</strong></p><p>Beowulf's youthful kinsman and retainer aid him in the battle against the dragon as the other warriors flee. <strong>Wiglaf</strong> demonstrates greater adherence to the heroic ethic than any of <strong>Beowulf</strong>'s other retainers, showing his suitability as Beowulf's successor.</p><p><strong>- Ecgtheow</strong></p><p><strong>Ecgtheow</strong> is the father of Beowulf, the brother-in-law of Hygelac, and Hrothgar's companion. <strong>Ecgtheow</strong> is deceased when the story begins, but he lives on in his son's remembrances and via the honorable reputation he earned throughout his lifetime.</p><p><strong>- Breca</strong></p><p>Beowulf's childhood pal Breca, whom he defeated in a swimming competition. Unferth alludes to the tale of their contest, and Beowulf proceeds to describe it in detail.</p><p><strong>- Sigemund</strong></p><p>A legendary Norse figure is renowned for defeating a monster. Beowulf is praised in <strong>Sigemund</strong>'s tale, which also foreshadows Beowulf's meeting with the dragon.</p><p><strong>- Princess Modthryth</strong></p><p>A legendary queen who punishes anyone who looks at her improperly. The purpose of sharing <strong>Modthryth</strong>'s narrative is to contrast her ruthlessness with Hygd's compassionate and sensible actions.</p><p></p><p><strong>REPRESENTATION OF THE CHARACTER IN THE PRESENT SOCIETY</strong></p><p>- <strong>BEOWULF</strong>: Our national hero, like Jose Rizal.</p><p>- <strong>KING HROTHGAR</strong>: King Solomon was renowned for his sageness.</p><p>- <strong>GRENDEL</strong>: Something horrible and demonic, such as criminals or murderers.</p><p>- <strong>GRENDEL'S MOTHER</strong>: Represent the military strategist. In actuality, a country still in battle represents her as being in a state of war.</p><p>- <strong>WIGLAF</strong>: symbolize valor and fidelity; our hospital's physicians exemplified these qualities.</p><p>- <strong>THE DRAGON</strong>: The dragon in Beowulf represents avarice. Thus, dragons may be comparable to those who cause us harm.</p><p></p><p><strong>Learn more about Beowulf story here:</strong></p><p><strong>https://brainly.ph/question/70528</strong></p><p><strong>#SPJ2</strong></p><br />
