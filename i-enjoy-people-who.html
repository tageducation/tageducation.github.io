                                            IV - Have you thought of becoming a modern musician? If you are to create your own band name, what would it be? From the generated band name, create a presentation of a genre that would relate to your proposed band.ANSWER:If I had to make my own band, I would call it ACUA-HEAT BAND. Because the song I will compose is fierce and sometimes gentle. I will take my companions and I will form a group to form ACUA- HEAT BAND GROUP that many people will really enjoy. I want to introduce it to the whole world and show our band that will not just back down from any request of the people who will support and rely on us.sana maka tulong pindutin mo nmn yung button na puso jan​</a>

The former things will not be remembered, nor will they come to mind.18 But be glad and rejoice forever in what I will create, for I will create Jerusalem to be a delight and its people a joy.19 I will rejoice over Jerusalem and take delight in my people; the sound of weeping and of crying will be heard in it no more.20 “Never again will there be in it an infant who lives but a few days, or an old man who does not live out his years; the one who dies at a hundred will be thought a mere child; the one who fails to reach[a] a hundred will be considered accursed.21 They will build houses and dwell in them; they will plant vineyards and eat their fruit.22 No longer will they build houses and others live in them, or plant and others eat.For as the days of a tree so will be the days of my people; my chosen ones will long enjoy the work of their hands.23 They will not labor in vain, nor will they bear children doomed to misfortune;for they will be a people blessed by the Lord, they and their descendants with them.24 Before they call I will answer; while they are still speaking I will hear.25 The wolf and the lamb will feed together, and the lion will eat straw like the ox, and dust will be the serpent’s food. They will neither harm nor destroy on all my holy mountain,” says the Lord.Jesus will never leave you until the end...</a>
