Captain America. Superman. Wonder Woman. These are famous superheroes that have kept their worlds safe, but they have also helped our world. The idea of superheroes has greatly benefited society by giving them creativity, confidence, and courage. Children usually dress up as superheroes during Halloween, or even on a regular basis.

                                            1. Thesis Statement: People with good attitudes tend to be more effective problem solvers, and te am-players which are the types of people most employers are looking for. Being able to see the positive side of a negative situation is a valuable character trait in the workplace. Positive thinking contributes to more productivity and workplace harmony, whereas someone who is negative and complains a lot could affect others with their negativity and result in less productivity in the workplace, which is why most employers steer clear of pessimists. 2. Thesis Statement: Nothing is more frustrating to an employer than someone who cuts corners or leaves work incomplete. Employers want to hire people who are not just positive about doing work, but are willing to put in a bit of extra effort to get the work done. If you can show an employer that you are willing to break a sweat to get a job done, they will take you more seriously as a capable candidate for the position you are applying for 3. Thesis Statement: Passion and willingness to work hard can only offer a prospective employer so much. Unless you can show how your experiences have helped prepare you for the position you are interviewing for, the employers may decide to go with a candidate who has completed the appropriate training already. It is costly and time consuming to train a new employee, which may make many employers hesitate before hiring less-qualified applicants.​</a>

With her grandma behind her, Mae joins a resistance movement and becomes the poster child for green-eyed rights, but how will all of this attention affect Mae's family, especially her parents who wanted her to hide who she was?1.

"You are an idiot! Can you stay out of my sight?"• These sorts of conflicts are the most common. Your characters will be opposed by or will oppose the actions, reactions, motivations of another character or characters.3. "I certainly am. I do my best to love everybody. It's never an insult to be called what somebody thinks is a bad name. It just shows you how poor that person is, it doesn't hurt you. So don't let Mrs. Dubose get you down...".• These are conflicts where your characters' firm beliefs are against norms that the entire society as a whole endorses. It could be social evils or discrimination practiced by society that isopposed by a minority,4. Utterly unprepared for this gesture, Binoy remained frozen, unable to respond.Back home, he repeatedly cursed himself for this minor lapse.These are internal battles that character's wage within themselves; these are internal issues that affect their actions, motivations and interactions with other characters.5.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Title:<strong> Beauty and the Beast</strong></p><p>Narration: <strong>An arrogant young prince (Prince Adam) and his castle's servants fall under the spell of a wicked enchantress, who turns him into the hideous Beast until he learns to love and be loved in return. The spirited, headstrong village girl Belle enters the Beast's castle after he imprisons her father (Maurice). With the help of his enchanted servants, including the matronly Mrs. Potts, Belle begins to draw the cold-hearted Beast out of his isolation.</strong></p><p>Characters: (Protagonists): <strong>Beauty/Belle - she is beautiful, inspiring, caring and strong, but she is also a reader, a loner, and a free thinker who can be bold and even a bit brash.</strong></p><p><strong>                    </strong>(Protagonists):  <strong>Beast/Prince Adam - a figure haunted by his past mistakes. Quick temper and prone to anger. Despite this, he has an inner beauty.</strong></p><p><strong>                    </strong>(Antagonist):  <strong>Gaston - he is an arrogant and aggressive hunter whose unrequited feelings for the intellectual Belle drive him to murder his adversary, the Beast, once he realizes she cares for him instead.</strong></p><p>Questions:</p><p>1.  <strong>The relation of the title - </strong><strong>(Beauty and the Beast) </strong><strong> to the film as a whole, is a young woman named Beauty who happens to fall in love with a Beast.</strong></p><p></p><p>2.  <strong>Yes. Different aspects of sound enhance the characters and the story, making the movie a complete experience.</strong></p><p></p><p>3. <strong>The color BROWN that was used mostly throughout the film, is said to represent-- sensation, outdoors, reliability, comfort, and simplicity.</strong></p><p></p><p>4. <strong>As</strong> <strong>the Beast climbs his crumbling tower, the orchestra rises to meet him, </strong>and the film reaches its emotional climax.</p><p></p><p>5. The central idea of Beauty and the Beast, is that <strong>we should value inward characteristics such as kindness over other superficial qualities, such as wit and appearance.</strong></p><p></p><p>6. <strong>The film </strong><strong>Beauty and the Beast</strong><strong> took place in France. Belle and her father lived in a “provincial town” on the coast of France before the French Revolution.</strong></p><p></p><p>7. <strong>What i liked about the film, is that it teaches us to not judge a person by their physical appearance, but to love and accept them for who they are truly on the inside.</strong></p><p>8-9. ( Your own answer)</p><p></p><p>10. <strong>After Gaston falls to his death, Belle pulls a wounded Beast up onto the balcony and lays him out. He tells Belle he's glad he got to see her one last time before dying. ... Then, there's magic rain and the Beast gets healed and transforms back into the Prince.</strong></p><p><strong>      For me, i wouldn't want to change the ending of this film, just because the ending felt emotional which perfectly portrays the whole movie.</strong></p><p></p>Greeting:<strong> </strong><p>hi! this answer is completely original, and from my own mind. I hope this found you useful and helpful.. but either way i had fun answering these questions :D i love the film Beauty and the Beast, i'd keep re-watching it when i was seven, so this was the first thing that came into my mind.

                            26. 1. Thesis Statement: People with good attitudes tend to be more effective problem solvers, and te am-players which are the types of people most employers are looking for. Being able to see the positive side of a negative situation is a valuable character trait in the workplace. Positive thinking contributes to more productivity and workplace harmony, whereas someone who is negative and complains a lot could affect others with their negativity and result in less productivity in the workplace, which is why most employers steer clear of pessimists. 2. Thesis Statement: Nothing is more frustrating to an employer than someone who cuts corners or leaves work incomplete. Employers want to hire people who are not just positive about doing work, but are willing to put in a bit of extra effort to get the work done. If you can show an employer that you are willing to break a sweat to get a job done, they will take you more seriously as a capable candidate for the position you are applying for 3. Thesis Statement: Passion and willingness to work hard can only offer a prospective employer so much. Unless you can show how your experiences have helped prepare you for the position you are interviewing for, the employers may decide to go with a candidate who has completed the appropriate training already. It is costly and time consuming to train a new employee, which may make many employers hesitate before hiring less-qualified applicants.​</h2><br />

Match each line to the type ofconflicts inside the box.1. The ship sank. It made a sound like a monstrous metallic burp. Things bubbledat the surface and then vanished.* Nature serves as the obstacle for characters. You could choose to write a particular scene around a natural calamity such as a typhoon or tsunami.2. "You are an idiot! Can you stay out of my sight?"• These sorts of conflicts are the most common. Your characters will be opposed by or will oppose the actions, reactions, motivations of another character or characters.3. "I certainly am. I do my best to love everybody. It's never an insult to be called what somebody thinks is a bad name. It just shows you how poor that person is, it doesn't hurt you. So don't let Mrs. Dubose get you down...".• These are conflicts where your characters' firm beliefs are against norms that the entire society as a whole endorses. It could be social evils or discrimination practiced by society that isopposed by a minority,4. Utterly unprepared for this gesture, Binoy remained frozen, unable to respond.Back home, he repeatedly cursed himself for this minor lapse.These are internal battles that character's wage within themselves; these are internal issues that affect their actions, motivations and interactions with other characters.5. A student lost his report because his laptop has run out of power.• This problem occurs when man becomes dependent on technology which failed to do its function.​</h2><br />
