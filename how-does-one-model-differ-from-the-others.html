                                            Good Deed I learned about the joy of helping others when I was in kindergarten. One of my classmates had forgotten his snack, so he had nothing to eat during recess. Nobody wanted to share with him because we were all very hungry and it was really his own fault that he would have to go without. That day my mother had packed my favorite treat: a chocolate and peanut butter cup. I wanted it all for myself, but my mother had often told me that I should share, so I broke my choc- olate and peanut butter cup in half and gave my forgetful classmate one half. He nearly fell over in surprise. Then he smiled the biggest smile I had ever seen and I suddenly felt the greatest happiness I had ever felt. After that, I always looked for chances to help people, because it always made them and me feel good.

                                            According to Owen Flanagan (2000), there are four major philosophical questions about dreaming:
1. How can I be sure I am not always dreaming?
2. Can I be immoral in dreams?
3. Are dreams conscious experiences that occur during sleep?
4. Does dreaming have an evolutionary function?
These interrelated questions cover philosophical domains as diverse as metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, scientific methodology, and the philosophy of biology, mind and language. This article covers the four questions and also looks at some newly emerging philosophical questions about dreams:
5. Is dreaming an ideal scientific model for consciousness research?
6. Is dreaming an instance of hallucinating or imagining?
Section 1 introduces the traditional philosophical question that Descartes asked himself, a question which has championed scepticism about the external world. How can I be sure I am not always dreaming, or dreaming right now? Philosophers have typically looked for features that distinguish dreams from waking life and one key debate centres on whether it is possible to feel pain in a dream.
Section 2 surveys the ethics of dreaming. The classical view of Augustine is contrasted with more abstract ethical positions, namely, those of the Deontologist, the Consequentialist and the Virtue Ethicist. The notion of lucid dreaming is examined here in light of the question of responsibility during dreaming and how we treat other dream characters.
Sections 3 covers the various different positions, objections and replies to question 3: the debate about whether dreaming is, or is not, a conscious state. The challenges from Malcolm and Dennett are covered. These challenges question the authority of the common-sense view of dreaming as a consciously experienced state. Malcolm argues that the concept of dreaming is incoherent, while Dennett puts forward a theory of dreaming without appealing to consciousness.
Section 4 covers the evolutionary debate, where empirical work ultimately leaves us uncertain of the extent to which natural selection has shaped dreaming, if at all. Early approaches by Freud and Jung are reviewed, followed by approaches by Flanagan and Revonsuo. Though Freud, Jung and Revonsuo have argued that dreaming is functional, Flanagan represents a view shared by many neuroscientists that dreaming has no function at all.
Section 5 looks at questions 5 and 6. Question 5 is about the cutting edge issue of precisely how dreaming should be integrated into the research program of consciousness. Should dreaming be taken as a scientific model of consciousness? Might dreaming play another role such as a contrast analysis with other mental states? Question 6, which raises a question of the exact qualitative nature of dreaming, has a longer history, though it is also receiving contemporary attention. The section outlines reasons favouring the orthodox view of psychology, that dream imagery is perceptual (hallucinatory), and reasons favouring the philosophical challenge to that orthodoxy, that dreams are ultimately imaginative in nature.

                            15. Good Deed I learned about the joy of helping others when I was in kindergarten. One of my classmates had forgotten his snack, so he had nothing to eat during recess. Nobody wanted to share with him because we were all very hungry and it was really his own fault that he would have to go without. That day my mother had packed my favorite treat: a chocolate and peanut butter cup. I wanted it all for myself, but my mother had often told me that I should share, so I broke my choc- olate and peanut butter cup in half and gave my forgetful classmate one half. He nearly fell over in surprise. Then he smiled the biggest smile I had ever seen and I suddenly felt the greatest happiness I had ever felt. After that, I always looked for chances to help people, because it always made them and me feel good.

                        <p>Answer: </p><p></p><p>1. In the first sentence, the writer articulates the joy of helping others that he learned when he was in kindergarten. </p><p></p><p>2. In the following sentences, the writer develops this idea by describing a situation in which he had to choose between helping another student and having something for himself. He chose to share his favorite treat with his classmate, despite his own hunger and the other student's fault for forgetting his snack. </p><p></p><p>3. The paragraph ends by emphasizing how this experience made the writer feel good, and how it led him to always look for chances to help people. The last sentence signifies that the writer has gained a sense of greatness by helping others.</p><p></p><p>4. The parts of the paragraph are the introduction, the story, the conclusion, and the implications. </p><p></p><p>5. The character in the paragraph manifests greatness by showing selflessness, generosity, and compassion in sacrificing his own favorite treat to help a classmate. </p><p></p><p>6. This paragraph is different from the two poems in the text in that it is a narrative rather than a poem. Furthermore, it is written in prose instead of verse and it offers a real-life example of a kind deed, as opposed to the more abstract concepts explored in the two poems.</p><br />

While the transmission model focused on how a message was transmitted and whether or not it was received, the interaction model is more concerned with the communication process itself. In fact, this model acknowledges that there are so many messages being sent at one time that many of them may not even be received. Some messages are also unintentionally sent. Therefore, communication isn’t judged effective or ineffective in this model based on whether or not a single message was successfully transmitted and received.</strong></p><br />

                            18. According to Owen Flanagan (2000), there are four major philosophical questions about dreaming:
1. How can I be sure I am not always dreaming?
2. Can I be immoral in dreams?
3. Are dreams conscious experiences that occur during sleep?
4. Does dreaming have an evolutionary function?
These interrelated questions cover philosophical domains as diverse as metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, scientific methodology, and the philosophy of biology, mind and language. This article covers the four questions and also looks at some newly emerging philosophical questions about dreams:
5. Is dreaming an ideal scientific model for consciousness research?
6. Is dreaming an instance of hallucinating or imagining?
Section 1 introduces the traditional philosophical question that Descartes asked himself, a question which has championed scepticism about the external world. How can I be sure I am not always dreaming, or dreaming right now? Philosophers have typically looked for features that distinguish dreams from waking life and one key debate centres on whether it is possible to feel pain in a dream.
Section 2 surveys the ethics of dreaming. The classical view of Augustine is contrasted with more abstract ethical positions, namely, those of the Deontologist, the Consequentialist and the Virtue Ethicist. The notion of lucid dreaming is examined here in light of the question of responsibility during dreaming and how we treat other dream characters.
Sections 3 covers the various different positions, objections and replies to question 3: the debate about whether dreaming is, or is not, a conscious state. The challenges from Malcolm and Dennett are covered. These challenges question the authority of the common-sense view of dreaming as a consciously experienced state. Malcolm argues that the concept of dreaming is incoherent, while Dennett puts forward a theory of dreaming without appealing to consciousness.
Section 4 covers the evolutionary debate, where empirical work ultimately leaves us uncertain of the extent to which natural selection has shaped dreaming, if at all. Early approaches by Freud and Jung are reviewed, followed by approaches by Flanagan and Revonsuo. Though Freud, Jung and Revonsuo have argued that dreaming is functional, Flanagan represents a view shared by many neuroscientists that dreaming has no function at all.
Section 5 looks at questions 5 and 6. Question 5 is about the cutting edge issue of precisely how dreaming should be integrated into the research program of consciousness. Should dreaming be taken as a scientific model of consciousness? Might dreaming play another role such as a contrast analysis with other mental states? Question 6, which raises a question of the exact qualitative nature of dreaming, has a longer history, though it is also receiving contemporary attention. The section outlines reasons favouring the orthodox view of psychology, that dream imagery is perceptual (hallucinatory), and reasons favouring the philosophical challenge to that orthodoxy, that dreams are ultimately imaginative in nature.
