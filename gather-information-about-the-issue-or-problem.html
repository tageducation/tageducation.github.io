Homeroom Guidance teacher. Try to apply the five basic steps in making a decision.

Do this on a piece of paper.

1. Define the problem.

2. Gather information about the issue or problem.

3. Know your options.

4. Weigh the pros and cons of each option.

5. Take the courage to decide. Answer:<p>1. Determine the issue. It is pointless to advance unless you have a clear knowledge of the problem, purpose, or decision to be made. Your judgments will be inaccurate if the problem is expressed improperly or unclearly. Please be as descriptive as possible.</p><p></p><p>2. It is preferable to obtain relevant knowledge that is directly related to the situation when making smart decisions. This will assist you in better understanding what has to be done in order to solve the problem, as well as generating ideas for a possible solution.</p><p></p><p>3. This is an important phase since it allows you to go over the advantages and disadvantages of the many possibilities you outlined in the previous step. It's also crucial because you want to be comfortable with all of your options and the probable outcomes of whatever you choose.</p><p></p><p>On a sheet of paper, write the Pros in one column and the Cons in the other. Make a list of all the alternatives in the left hand margin. Each and every one should be weighed. If necessary, continue writing about it. When doing so, make use of all of your resources.</p><p></p><p>4. Now comes the exciting (or terrifying) phase. You've figured out what your problem or aim is. You've gathered all of the relevant data, sought advice from experts, and assessed the pros and disadvantages. Now is the moment to make a decision. You've eliminated all of the options that are ridiculous, ineffective, or just do not fit.</p><p></p><p>5. A decision is worthless unless it is implemented. If you aren't adept at taking action steps, enlist the support of someone who is. The follow-up phase is a part of the implementation phase. The follow-up guarantees that you're staying on track! Make a list of the measures you'll need to do to put your decision into action. Then get ready to take it one step at a time. This may necessitate your perseverance. The final result may take some time to appear. You can make changes to your decision along the way, or you can go back to step two and choose another alternative.</p><p></p><p>The  Problem Solving and Decision  making: https://brainly.ph/question/4524127</p><p></p><p>#BrainlyEveryday</p><br />

Making decisions is making choices or not choosing at all. Deciding on your own may be very difficult at your age. Children like you need guidance from parents, guardians, or older siblings in making decisions. People have experienced making good and bad decisions and it is helpful to learn from it and move on. There are factors that influence the decision-making process of adolescence,like peer, environment, family, knowledge and skills to decide, beliefs, culture, and many more. In some studies, the psychological and social factors most of the time have great effect on the decisions of adolescents like you.There are five basic steps in making a decision. 1. Define the problem. 2. Gather information about the issue or problem.3. Know your options.4. Weigh the pros and cons of each option. 5. Take the courage to decide and act on it. If the issue or problem is not solved, go back to your step number 1 and follow the other steps again until you succeed. Always remember that you are a work in progress. If you fail, the only way up is to stand and try again. Take your failures as opportunities to become better. As American inventor Thomas Edison said, “I have not failed.

They tend to come about through a decision-making process. And for this it is crucial to focus the question at the start of this decision-making process not only on YES or NO as possible answers. Even though such a closed formulation of a question is easier to understand and more specific, it excludes more favourable alternatives. Formulating an open question like “Which alternatives do I have?”, or “What other possible decisions are there?” opens the perspective for further decision-making options.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Pa thanks, rate po at brainliest thank you ✨</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>:)</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>1. Determine the issue. It is pointless to advance unless you have a clear knowledge of the problem, purpose, or decision to be made. Your judgments will be inaccurate if the problem is expressed improperly or unclearly. Please be as descriptive as possible.
</p><p>
</p><p>2. It is preferable to obtain relevant knowledge that is directly related to the situation when making smart decisions. This will assist you in better understanding what has to be done in order to solve the problem, as well as generating ideas for a possible solution.
</p><p>
</p><p>3. This is an important phase since it allows you to go over the advantages and disadvantages of the many possibilities you outlined in the previous step. It's also crucial because you want to be comfortable with all of your options and the probable outcomes of whatever you choose.
</p><p>
</p><p>On a sheet of paper, write the Pros in one column and the Cons in the other. Make a list of all the alternatives in the left hand margin. Each and every one should be weighed. If necessary, continue writing about it. When doing so, make use of all of your resources.
</p><p>
</p><p>4. Now comes the exciting (or terrifying) phase. You've figured out what your problem or aim is. You've gathered all of the relevant data, sought advice from experts, and assessed the pros and disadvantages. Now is the moment to make a decision. You've eliminated all of the options that are ridiculous, ineffective, or just do not fit.
</p><p>
</p><p>5. A decision is worthless unless it is implemented. If you aren't adept at taking action steps, enlist the support of someone who is. The follow-up phase is a part of the implementation phase. The follow-up guarantees that you're staying on track! Make a list of the measures you'll need to do to put your decision into action. Then get ready to take it one step at a time. This may necessitate your perseverance. The final result may take some time to appear. You can make changes to your decision along the way, or you can go back to step two and choose another alternative.</p><br />
