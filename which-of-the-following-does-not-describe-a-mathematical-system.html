                        <p>Based on the options given, the option that does NOT describe a mathematical system is: <strong>B. Postulate and axions.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>EXPLANATION:</strong></p><p>When studying mathematics in more depth, we will often encounter terms, such as <strong>axioms</strong>, <strong>postulates</strong>, <strong>definitions</strong>, <strong>theorems</strong>, <strong>propositions</strong>, and so on. All of these terms are closely related to propositional logic, which is about proving the truth of a statement. These terms may not have appeared in elementary math books, but they are certain to appear in junior high school math books and above. Sometimes these terms are not explained in detail.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>1. Axioms</strong></p><p>An axiom is a statement that is assumed to be true and general in nature so that it does not need to be proven again. Axioms can also be interpreted as <strong>principles/rules</strong> that apply universally. In addition, an axiom can be seen as a statement whose truth is absolute and cannot be doubted. Axioms do not need to be proven because they contain no contradictions or because we clearly know that the statement must be true.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>3.Definition</strong></p><p>Definitions are statements related to certain concepts which are the result of a <strong>mutual agreement</strong>. Previously, please note that there are some concepts that are not given a definition. For example, points, lines and planes have no definition in the study of geometry.</p><p></p><p><strong>3. Theorem</strong></p><p>Theorem is a statement whose truth can be shown through a proof. Theorems generally consist of two parts, namely <strong>conjecture</strong> (hypothesis) and <strong>conclusions</strong>. Theorems arise from assumptions that have been made previously or from the connection of one definition to another definition of a particular concept. Theorems and postulates are synonyms and can be used interchangeably, but there are some cases of use that tend to use specific terms.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>4. Lemma</strong></p><p>An entry is a simple theorem that is used to prove another larger theorem. Entries are generally not very interesting, but they are important because they can be used to prove more <strong>complex</strong> things. Each entry is proved individually, but the proof of the theorem sometimes requires several entries at once.</p><p></p><p><strong>5. Corollaries</strong></p><p>Corollary or consequence/consequence is a theorem that is formed directly from <strong>another existing theorem</strong>. It can also be said that a corollary is a theorem that follows from another theorem.</p><p></p><p>Learn more about <strong>the theorem that is not included in triangle inequality in two triangles:</strong></p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/17001203</p><p></p><p>#SPJ6</p><br />
