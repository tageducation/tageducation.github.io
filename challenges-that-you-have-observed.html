                                            CHALLENGES ARE NORMAL OCCURRENCES IN LIFE. NO SINGLE PERSON CAN SAY THAT HE OR SHE HAS NEVER ENCOUNTERED A CHALLENGE. FROM THE TIME YOU WERE BORN AS A BABY, YOU STRUGGLED TO CRAWL, TO WALK AND TO TALK. AS A TODDLER, YOU STRUGGLED TO CONTAIN YOUR TANTRUMS WHEN YOU DID NOT GET WHAT YOU WANTED. AS YOU ADDED YEARS IN YOUR LIFE, YOU BEGAN TO NOTICE THAT THE CHALLENGES YOU EXPERIENCE BECAME MORE VARIED, COMPLEX AND DIFFICULT THAN BEFORE.THIS HEALTH CRISIS SITUATION THAT WE ARE EXPERIENCING IS A CHALLENGE IN ITSELF. WE SOMETIMES STRUGGLE TO REMEMBER AND APPLY ALL THE NECESSARY HEALTH AND SAFETY PROTOCOLS FROM AUTHORITIES. WE STRUGGLE TO AVOID GOING TO PLACES IF IT IS NOT NECESSARY. WE STRUGGLE TO FIND SAFE WAYS TO KEEP IN TOUCH WITH FAMILY, FRIENDS AND LOVED ONES WHILE OBSERVING PHYSICAL DISTANCING. EVEN THE LEARNING SETUP IS A CHALLENGE NOT ONLY FOR YOU BUT FOR YOUR CLASSMATES, PARENTS, FAMILY MEMBERS, TEACHERS, AND FRIENDS, AS WELL.THUS EVERYONE EXPERIENCES CHALLENGES EVEN BEFORE COVID-19. COULD YOU IMAGINE A LIFE WITHOUT CHALLENGES? A LIFE WHERE YOU DON'T HAVE TO OVERCOME ANY CHALLENGE AT ALL? REGARDLESS OF IT'S KIND, WE MUST CONSTANTLY EQUIP OURSELVES WITH WAYS ON HOW WE CAN RISE ABOVE THESE CHALLENGES AND DEAL WITH IT POSITIVELY, WE HAVE TO DEVELOPE EFFECTIVE STUDY HABITS FOR THE ATTAINMENT FOR EXEMPLARY PERFORMANCE NOT ONLY IN SCHOOL BUT IN LIFE LATER ON.​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.Life is an uncertain roller coaster. You can choose to embrace it and enjoy the ride, joyfully learning from your experiences along the way; or you can choose to rebel against all of life’s challenges, resenting every moment of your journey. The latter robs you of any growth or development, while the former gives you the opportunity to learn from those challenges and become a better person for having experienced them.</p><p></p><p>2.Change is inevitable. You’ll inherit new responsibilities at work, your marriage may go through trials and your roles in life will shift. Even positive changes – a promotion, birth/adoption or new home – can cause inner turmoil. From personal shifts to a changing political climate, adjusting to a new normal can be challenging. You may feel a mix of emotions ranging from joy to sadness and depression.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>Sorry po sa mata-as na answer pero tama po yan salamat<br />
