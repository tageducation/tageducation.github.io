This paper would have been even better if the student had added a sentence or two about the results of the study. That way, after reading the first paragraph, the reader would know the purpose, hypotheses, and findings. Next, the student described specifics about the research design, including the sample, instrumentation, and data analysis. Ecological and population generalizability were discussed. The student spoke at length on threats to internal validity. Following the information on threats to internal validity, the student provided suggestions regarding how these threats could have been dealt with. This shows a high level of understanding. Not only does the student know what the weakness of the study are, he provides ways the study could have been improved. One thing that was not discussed in this paper is the literature review. That's why you'll see some fairly complex explanations in this paper on the data analysis but no information on the literature review. Your paper will contain information on the literature review and less specific information on statistics.”What type of work is being critiqued?A. CreativeB. ResearchC. MediaD. Literarys​</a>

                                            DUTERTE ADMIN PROVIDED TO SPED UP COVID 19 MASS TESTING AMID EXTENDED LOCKDOWN ( by: Gabriel Pabico Lalu-Reporter/@GabrielLalunINQINQUIRER.net/09:51 PM
MANILA, Philippines- The government should take advantage of the latest extension of the COVID-19 lockdown over the National Capital Region and other areas by speeding up its mass testing procedures.
This was the call of the Bagong Alyansang Makabayan (Bayan), stressing that the Duterte Administration should "rectify serious short comings" in its fight against pandemic.
"Government should step up mass testing not just in terms of the total number of tests but more so in terms of the concentration or focus on the tests, the areas that have a high incidence of COVID 19,"Bayan secretary-general Renato Reyes said in a statement.
"The necessary health and economic measures have long been lacking in the areas under ECQ which is the reason why another extension is now being imposed. The government must also rectify theses serious shortcomings towards the eventual lifting of the ECQ," he added.
The national government on Tuesday extended the enhanced community quarantine -albeit "modified"- in NCR , Cebu City and Laguna province until May 31 as these areas are still considered "high risk" for COVID 19 transmission and placed dozens of provinces deemed to have "moderate rsk"for virus spread under the general community quarantine (GCQ) from May 16.
Meanwhile, the national government is set to remove quarantine measures in areas considered "low-risk" for COVID 19 transmission by May 16.
Reyes said the government must still ensure that health measures are in place and personal protective equipment lie facemask must remain available across the country amid loosened quarantine classifications.
"The lifting of the ECQ and the transition to GCQ in many provinces still necessitates timey health interventions as the population prepares to return to work," he explained.
"The health of the work force must be ensured. Face masks should be made free. Employers should shoulder the cost of mass testing of their workforce. Transportation which was already lacking even before the ECQ should be made available for the workforce, "he added.
Presidential spokesperson Harry Roque previously admitted that the government missed out on its April 30 goal of having 8,000 tests per day but also said that the "by hook or by crook, " the country will do the COVID 19 test of 30,000 a day by the end of May. Calls for the government to urgently move to adopt a policy on mass testing started in March.
DOH data on May 10 showed that 173, 352 individuals have tested for possible coronavirus infection by various testing sites, with 15,002 initially testing positive.
And despite the easing of quarantine regulations, DOH has admitted that they have yet to control the spread of the novel coronavirus or SARS-CoV-2, which causes respiratory illness COVID 19, reminding people to still observe health protocols to avert mass infections.
As of Tuesday, DOH said the Philippines has 11, 350 SARS CoV-2 infections as well as 751 deaths and 2, 106 recoveries from COVID 19.

                                            Which excerpt from The Death of Ivan Ilych can be used as textual evidence to support a thesis statement on the theme of loneliness?
There was no deceiving himself: something terrible, new, and more important than anything before in his life, was taking place within him of which he alone was aware. Those about him did not understand or would not understand it, but thought everything in the world was going on as usual.That tormented Ivan Ilych more than anything.
At the law courts too, Ivan Ilych noticed, or thought he noticed, a strange attitude towards himself. It sometimes seemed to him that people were watching him inquisitively as a man whose place might soon be vacant.
Then again, his friends would suddenly begin to chaff him in a friendly way about his low spirits, as if the awful, horrible, and unheard-of thing that was going on within him, incessantly gnawing at him and irresistibly drawing him away, was a very agreeable subject for jests.
Ivan Ilych settled down very pleasantly in this new town. The society there, which inclined towards opposition to the governor was friendly, his salary was larger, and he began to play *vint* [a form of bridge], which he found added not a little to the pleasure of life, for he had a capacity for cards, played good-humouredly, and calculated rapidly and astutely, so that he usually won.
Ivan Ilych was esteemed a good official, and after three years was made Assistant Public Prosecutor. His new duties, their importance, the possibility of indicting and imprisoning anyone he chose, the publicity his speeches received, and the success he had in all these things, made his work still more attractive.</a>

                                            True or False 9) The persecutions caused the early Christians to give up on their mission of spreading the Church.  10) If God is with us, we can endure everything, even death.  11) Before his conversion, Paul formerly called Saul, actively took part in the persecution of the Christians.  12) It is the Church who reveals to the world the mystery of the Lord.  13) The Church gathers people from various cultures and nations.  14) Liturgical celebrations (Mass) can be adapted to the culture of the people gathered.  15) Church members are only connected by visible bonds of unity.  16) Church is made up of both human and divine elements.  17) The Catholic Church has a relationship with religions that do not share the belief in one God.  18) Church is one because God is one.  19) One of the essential characteristics of the Church is HELPFUL.  20) Apostles' Creed or Nicene Creed summarizes the truths about the Church.  21) In the New Testament, Church means "an assembly of called-out ones." It refers to a people.  22) Each of us is called by Christ to do our part in taking responsibility for building a just society.  23) Following and imitating Christ is the moral life of Christians through our response of what our mind conceived.  24) Knowing well about the nature and mission of the Church, we will be more zealous in doing that which is good, true and right. 25) The Letter of Luke teaches us that it is because of Christ Jesus that we become one family.  26) Tracing the origin of the term Church as “kerygma”, the Church is the gathering of people being called by God.  27) The truths hidden in God can only be revealed by the Church thus the mystery of His Trinitarian indwelling is beyond full human understanding unless one looks at it with the eyes of faith.  28) As a sacrament (a sign that gives grace), the Church has a distinct relationship with Christ, is an instrument of intimate union with God. In her the unity of all mankind is impossible. 29) As the Kingdom of God on earth, the Church is shown in the teaching of Jesus read in the Gospels.  30) It is the Holy Spirit, alive and fruitful in Christ’s body who animates its movements.  31) Jesus Christ, who founded the Church as His body, wills that its mission is guided by the Holy Spirit and survive in spite of the trials. 32) Saint Callistus, a controversial figure in the early Church, established a rival bishopric against Rome.  33) Jesus encourages good deeds from a receptive conscience of those who desire to follow Him.  34) The mission of Christ is the mission of the Church.  35) The mission of the Church is for all peoples, especially the poor and marginalized.</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Comparative thanatologists study the responses to the dead and the dying in nonhuman animals. Despite the wide variety of thanatological behaviours that have been documented in several different species, comparative thanatologists assume that the concept of death (CoD) is very difficult to acquire and will be a rare cognitive feat once we move past the human species. In this paper, we argue that this assumption is based on two forms of anthropocentrism: (1) an intellectual anthropocentrism, which leads to an over-intellectualisation of the CoD, and (2) an emotional anthropocentrism, which yields an excessive focus on grief as a reaction to death. Contrary to what these two forms of anthropocentrism suggest, we argue that the CoD requires relatively little cognitive complexity and that it can emerge independently from mourning behaviour. Moreover, if we turn towards the natural world, we can see that the minimal cognitive requirements for a CoD are in fact met by many nonhuman species and there are multiple learning pathways and opportunities for animals in the wild to develop a CoD. This allows us to conclude that the CoD will be relatively easy to acquire and, so, we can expect it to be fairly common in nature.
</p><p>
</p><p>Introduction
</p><p>Comparative thanatologists attempt to uncover the proximate mechanisms involved in the responses to the dead and the dying across animalFootnote1 species, as well as the ultimate functions behind these mechanisms. This area of study is filled with difficulties, given that ethical constraints make the use of experiments particularly tricky (Gonçalves and Biro 2018; Monsó 2019), and so scientists must rely more than usual on opportunistic observations gathered in the wild. Despite these methodological hurdles, comparative thanatologists tend to agree on the idea that the concept of death (hereafter, ‘CoD’) is an unusual cognitive feat once we move beyond the human species. For instance, despite the growing number of thanatological reports gathered on monkeys, who show huge variability in their reactions to death, De Marco et al. assert: “there is no reason to believe that monkeys have a concept of death” (De Marco et al. 2018, p. 58). Similarly, after a detailed review of the evidence, Gonçalves and Carvalho state that great apes —our closest living relatives—are the “likeliest candidates for achieving aspects of a human‐like concept of death,” but at the same time “the burden of proof still awaits future research” (Gonçalves and Carvalho 2019, p. 1519).
</p><p>
</p><p>Underlying this tacit agreement is the assumption that a CoD is very difficult to acquire, and that only species or individuals with high cognitive sophistication (such as great apes) can be capable of acquiring it. In this paper, we are going to argue against this assumption. We will do this in two steps. First, in Sect. 2, we will show that this presupposition stems from two forms of anthropocentrism that underlie scientists’ reflections on death: (1) an intellectual anthropocentrism, which leads to excessively demanding accounts of the CoD, and (2) an emotional anthropocentrism, which yields an unwarranted focus on grief as a reaction to death. Contrary to what these two forms of anthropocentrism suggest, we will argue that the CoD requires relatively little cognitive complexity and that it can emerge independently of mourning behaviour. Second, in Sect. 3, we will defend that a wide range of species and situations can allow for a CoD to arise in nature. To be clear, we do not intend to take a concrete stand on exactly which species can possess a CoD, since that is an empirical matter that is beyond the scope of this paper. Instead, we will examine the cognitive requirements of the CoD and show how, coupling this analysis with biological and ecological considerations, we can predict that the CoD is relatively easy to acquire and consequently much more prevalent in nature than is usually presupposed.

Though it may include teaching on the biological aspects of death, teaching about coping with grief is a primary focus. Death education is formally known as thanatology. Thanatology stems from the Greek word thanatos, meaning death, and ology meaning a science or organized body of knowledge.[1] A specialist in this field is referred to as a thanatologist. Death education refers to the experiences and activities of death that one deals with. Death education also deals with being able to grasp the different processes of dying, talk about the main topics of attitudes and meanings toward death, and the after effects on how to learn to care for people who are affected by the death. The main focus in death education is teaching people how to cope with grief. Many people feel death education is taboo and instead of talking about death and grieving, they hide it away and never bring it up with others. With the right education about death, the less taboo it may become.</p><br />

We now have more than six million cases of COVID-19 across the world and have lost more than 370,000 people to the virus. As we work with governments across the world to suppress the virus and accelerate science around diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines, we also continue to respond to other health emergencies and new disease outbreaks. We all know that the impacts of COVID-19 extend well beyond the death and disease caused by the virus itself. The pandemic has forced countries to make difficult choices about suspending some health services Building on previous guidance on maintaining CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING essential health services through the COVID-19 pandemic, today we are providing operational guidance on how best to put that into practice. Ensuring coordination and development of new ways to deliver care while limiting visits to health facilities are keys to keeping people safe and ensuring health systems are not overburdened.

This paper would have been even better if the student had added a sentence or two about the results of the study. That way, after reading the first paragraph, the reader would know the purpose, hypotheses, and findings. Next, the student described specifics about the research design, including the sample, instrumentation, and data analysis. Ecological and population generalizability were discussed. The student spoke at length on threats to internal validity. Following the information on threats to internal validity, the student provided suggestions regarding how these threats could have been dealt with. This shows a high level of understanding. Not only does the student know what the weakness of the study are, he provides ways the study could have been improved. One thing that was not discussed in this paper is the literature review. That's why you'll see some fairly complex explanations in this paper on the data analysis but no information on the literature review. Your paper will contain information on the literature review and less specific information on statistics.”What type of work is being critiqued?A. CreativeB. ResearchC. MediaD. Literarys​</h2><br />

Blank, of Barton Park, was found strangled this morning in the cottage owned by John Doe, 25, who was apprehended on the scene of the crime by officers Bailey and Hodge. Doe was found holding the body in his arms, and appeared to be in stupor, his only reply to repeated questioning being, "I killed her because I loved her." According to the members of the Blank family, Doe had paid attention to Miss Blank for the last several months, though it was strenuously denied that his regards for Miss Blank was returned. Miss Blank's engagement with Mr. Roger Weston was announced last month. Mr. Weston could not be reached for a statement. Mrs. Blank was prostrated by the news of her daughter's death.

Receiving no answer, they forced the door and discovered Doe sitting with the dead girl in his lap. She had apparently been strangled, Dr. A. P.

                            16. DUTERTE ADMIN PROVIDED TO SPED UP COVID 19 MASS TESTING AMID EXTENDED LOCKDOWN ( by: Gabriel Pabico Lalu-Reporter/@GabrielLalunINQINQUIRER.net/09:51 PM
MANILA, Philippines- The government should take advantage of the latest extension of the COVID-19 lockdown over the National Capital Region and other areas by speeding up its mass testing procedures.
This was the call of the Bagong Alyansang Makabayan (Bayan), stressing that the Duterte Administration should "rectify serious short comings" in its fight against pandemic.
"Government should step up mass testing not just in terms of the total number of tests but more so in terms of the concentration or focus on the tests, the areas that have a high incidence of COVID 19,"Bayan secretary-general Renato Reyes said in a statement.
"The necessary health and economic measures have long been lacking in the areas under ECQ which is the reason why another extension is now being imposed. The government must also rectify theses serious shortcomings towards the eventual lifting of the ECQ," he added.
The national government on Tuesday extended the enhanced community quarantine -albeit "modified"- in NCR , Cebu City and Laguna province until May 31 as these areas are still considered "high risk" for COVID 19 transmission and placed dozens of provinces deemed to have "moderate rsk"for virus spread under the general community quarantine (GCQ) from May 16.
Meanwhile, the national government is set to remove quarantine measures in areas considered "low-risk" for COVID 19 transmission by May 16.
Reyes said the government must still ensure that health measures are in place and personal protective equipment lie facemask must remain available across the country amid loosened quarantine classifications.
"The lifting of the ECQ and the transition to GCQ in many provinces still necessitates timey health interventions as the population prepares to return to work," he explained.
"The health of the work force must be ensured. Face masks should be made free. Employers should shoulder the cost of mass testing of their workforce. Transportation which was already lacking even before the ECQ should be made available for the workforce, "he added.
Presidential spokesperson Harry Roque previously admitted that the government missed out on its April 30 goal of having 8,000 tests per day but also said that the "by hook or by crook, " the country will do the COVID 19 test of 30,000 a day by the end of May. Calls for the government to urgently move to adopt a policy on mass testing started in March.
DOH data on May 10 showed that 173, 352 individuals have tested for possible coronavirus infection by various testing sites, with 15,002 initially testing positive.
And despite the easing of quarantine regulations, DOH has admitted that they have yet to control the spread of the novel coronavirus or SARS-CoV-2, which causes respiratory illness COVID 19, reminding people to still observe health protocols to avert mass infections.
As of Tuesday, DOH said the Philippines has 11, 350 SARS CoV-2 infections as well as 751 deaths and 2, 106 recoveries from COVID 19.

                            22. Which excerpt from The Death of Ivan Ilych can be used as textual evidence to support a thesis statement on the theme of loneliness?
There was no deceiving himself: something terrible, new, and more important than anything before in his life, was taking place within him of which he alone was aware. Those about him did not understand or would not understand it, but thought everything in the world was going on as usual.That tormented Ivan Ilych more than anything.
At the law courts too, Ivan Ilych noticed, or thought he noticed, a strange attitude towards himself. It sometimes seemed to him that people were watching him inquisitively as a man whose place might soon be vacant.
Then again, his friends would suddenly begin to chaff him in a friendly way about his low spirits, as if the awful, horrible, and unheard-of thing that was going on within him, incessantly gnawing at him and irresistibly drawing him away, was a very agreeable subject for jests.
Ivan Ilych settled down very pleasantly in this new town. The society there, which inclined towards opposition to the governor was friendly, his salary was larger, and he began to play *vint* [a form of bridge], which he found added not a little to the pleasure of life, for he had a capacity for cards, played good-humouredly, and calculated rapidly and astutely, so that he usually won.
Ivan Ilych was esteemed a good official, and after three years was made Assistant Public Prosecutor. His new duties, their importance, the possibility of indicting and imprisoning anyone he chose, the publicity his speeches received, and the success he had in all these things, made his work still more attractive.</h2><br />
                        <p>The textual evidence that supports the theme of loneliness is:
</p><p>There was no deceiving himself: something terrible, new, and more important than anything before in his life, was taking place within him of which he alone was aware. Those about him did not understand or would not understand it, but thought everything in the world was going on as usual. That tormented Ivan Ilych more than anything.
</p><p>It <strong>can be correctly concluded based on this excerpt from Leo  Tolstoy’s The death of Ivan Ilyich</strong> that Ivan was getting a unique experience. He was feeling things and thinking thoughts only and nobody else can see or understand. The <strong>purpose of a literary analysis essay</strong> of this piece would reveal the ordeals of finding oneself alone amidst a crowd, and how an individual can struggle within himself without anybody noticing, no matter how close they are. This defines how horrible loneliness can be.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Perceptions of Death and the Effects of Emotion</p><p></p><p>            Most people have dealt with the death of a loved one at some point in their life.  When dealing with death, different emotions come into play, based on how well a person copes.  Upon the occurrence of death, sadness is a common reaction of loved ones.  As a person tries to adjust to life without the person they cared about, depression may take hold.  Anger is another emotion commonly experienced by those who are grieving.  This is a normal grief reaction that should be encouraged, with attempts to redirect the anger, which is often displaced (Zilberfein, 1999).  As one lives with the loss, they become scared, lonely, and confused.  Once the person realizes that denying the loss will not make it go away, individuals often become angry (Gard, 2000).  Sadness, anger, happiness, fear, surprise, hope, contentment, and peacefulness are a few examples of adjectives used to describe how we view death based on the circumstances of the death.</p><br />

                            28. True or False 9) The persecutions caused the early Christians to give up on their mission of spreading the Church.  10) If God is with us, we can endure everything, even death.  11) Before his conversion, Paul formerly called Saul, actively took part in the persecution of the Christians.  12) It is the Church who reveals to the world the mystery of the Lord.  13) The Church gathers people from various cultures and nations.  14) Liturgical celebrations (Mass) can be adapted to the culture of the people gathered.  15) Church members are only connected by visible bonds of unity.  16) Church is made up of both human and divine elements.  17) The Catholic Church has a relationship with religions that do not share the belief in one God.  18) Church is one because God is one.  19) One of the essential characteristics of the Church is HELPFUL.  20) Apostles' Creed or Nicene Creed summarizes the truths about the Church.  21) In the New Testament, Church means "an assembly of called-out ones." It refers to a people.  22) Each of us is called by Christ to do our part in taking responsibility for building a just society.  23) Following and imitating Christ is the moral life of Christians through our response of what our mind conceived.  24) Knowing well about the nature and mission of the Church, we will be more zealous in doing that which is good, true and right. 25) The Letter of Luke teaches us that it is because of Christ Jesus that we become one family.  26) Tracing the origin of the term Church as “kerygma”, the Church is the gathering of people being called by God.  27) The truths hidden in God can only be revealed by the Church thus the mystery of His Trinitarian indwelling is beyond full human understanding unless one looks at it with the eyes of faith.  28) As a sacrament (a sign that gives grace), the Church has a distinct relationship with Christ, is an instrument of intimate union with God. In her the unity of all mankind is impossible. 29) As the Kingdom of God on earth, the Church is shown in the teaching of Jesus read in the Gospels.  30) It is the Holy Spirit, alive and fruitful in Christ’s body who animates its movements.  31) Jesus Christ, who founded the Church as His body, wills that its mission is guided by the Holy Spirit and survive in spite of the trials. 32) Saint Callistus, a controversial figure in the early Church, established a rival bishopric against Rome.  33) Jesus encourages good deeds from a receptive conscience of those who desire to follow Him.  34) The mission of Christ is the mission of the Church.  35) The mission of the Church is for all peoples, especially the poor and marginalized.</h2><br />
