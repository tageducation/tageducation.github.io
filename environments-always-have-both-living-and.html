                                            ECOSYSTEMSEcosystems consist of living and non-living organisms in an area. These include plants, animals, microbes, and elements like soil, water, and air. The living organisms depend on both living and non-living aspects of an ecosystem.An ecosystem can be as small as a puddle or as big as an ocean. It is a very delicate balance, with these life forms sustaining one another. Disruptions to an ecosystem may prove disastrous to all its organisms. When a new plant or animal is suddenly placed in an ecosystem, it will surely compete with the original inhabitants for resources. This stranger may even push out the natural organisms, causing them to be extinct. The organisms that depended on the extinct organisms will definitely be affected.The balance in ecosystems have been unsettled by natural disasters such as fires, floods, storms, and volcanic eruptions. However, in recent years and ironically, in the name of progress, human activity has affected many ecosystems around the world.Questions1. Which among the following is NOT a good description for an ecosystem? a. animals and plants relying on each other to surviveb. a place where people are friendly to the environmentc. a biological community where organisms affect each otherd. a variety of living and non-living things in a particular area2. Why is an ecosystem considered to be a delicate balance? a. There are big ecosystems and small ecosystems that have to bebalanced.b. Not all ecosystems weigh the same so their weight needs to bedistributed.c. A change in an ecosystem can have tremendous effects on all itsorganisms.d. Different organisms always have equal importance in any given ecosystem. 3. Which of the following is NOT one of the natural disasters that have caused ecosystems to be unsettled?a. firesb. floodsc. stormsd. Humans4. Based on the selection, which of the following is true about human progress and ecosystems? a. Human progress sometimes causes ecosystems to suffer.b. Human activity promotes the development of ecosystems.c. Human activity helps find solutions to ecological problems.d. Human progress causes different ecosystems to be progressive.5.	According to the selection, a new organism introduced in an ecosystem can have an effect on an original inhabitant when _____.a. it fights with and eventually eats the original inhabitantb. it consumes resources intended for the original inhabitantc. it makes the original inhabitant feel strange in the ecosystemd. it contributes to disasters that upset the balance in the system6. What should human beings do in order to maintain the balance indifferent ecosystems? a. Cut down a lot of trees so that there is more space for animals to live in.b. Take corals from the sea so that fish would have more freedom to swim.c. Plant more trees in order to replace those that have been cut down.d. Catch a lot of tuna so that nothing will eat the mackerel or the small fish.7. The diagram below shows an ocean ecosystem. The arrows point to the food source of the succeeding organism. If a new organism is introduced into the system and it eats the shrimplike creatures, how will this indirectly affect the mackerel? a. The mackerel will have no more shrimplike creatures to eat.b. The mackerel will still be eaten by the tuna fish as it continues toconsume the small fish.c. The mackerel will be eaten by the small fish which now has to look for a new food source.d. The mackerel might lose its food since without a food source, the smallfish could die.8.Using the same diagram, which of the following statements is FALSE? a. The small fish depends solely on shrimplike creatures for food.b. The tuna fish depends solely on the mackerel as its food source.c. The large shark depends solely on the tuna fish as its food source.d. The shrimplike creatures depend solely on one-celled life for food​​</a>

                                            Read the selection and explain how comparison and contrast is shown.(5 points each)Example:1. An experiment with dogs suggests that our canine pals, much like ourselves, differ in their attitude toward life: Some dogs are pessimists while others appear to be optimists. In an experiment at a British veterinary school, researchers placed bowls of food in a regular location and got dogs used to finding their dinner there. The researchers then placed a consistently empty bowl in a separate location with a second, food-filled bowl placed between the two. Some dogs, when led to the empty bowl, would just give up if no food was present. These were the pessimists. The optimists, however, having experienced a reward on previous occasions, would keep looking and eventually locate the bowl in the middle. The dogs labeled pessimistic also grew anxious if separated from their owners. They would bark, chew things, and urinate inappropriately. The optimistic dogs, however, tended to fall asleep when left alone. They also greeted strangers as possible substitute playmates. In contrast, the pessimistic dogs would react to strangers with fear and aggression. Answer; Some dogs are optimists and some are pessimists. They differ in several ways.2. There are several characteristics which distinguish plants from animals. Green plants are able to manufacture their own food from substances in the environment. This process is known as photosynthesis. In contrast, animals, including man, get their food either directly from plants or indirectly by eating animals which have eaten plants. Plants are generally stationary. Animals, on the other hand, can usually move about. In external appearance, plants are usually green. They grow in a branching fashion at their extremities, and their growth continues throughout their lives. Animals, however, are very diverse in their external appearance. Their growth pattern is not limited to their extremities. It is evenly distributed and only occurs in a definite time period. Therefore, the difference between plants and animals is quite significant Answer:3. Although I raised Marcee and Obbie since they were puppies, they have completely diverse personalities. Obbie is a six- year old, male, toy Pomeranian whereas Marcee is a one- year old, female, Boston terrier. Obbie is small and soft, unlike Marcee who has bristly hair and is much bigger. Marcee insists on sleeping on the bed, under the covers every night. On the other hand, Obbie will only sleep on the floor, under the bed. Obbie is tremendously loyal and uptight; however, Marcee is hyper and friendly to anyone she meets or sees. Around other dogs, Marcee cowers to the larger dog, yet Obbie will always stand his ground, never giving up until he is scolded. Given that they were both treated the same way all their lives, it is hard to believe that they are so different in everything they do. Answer:​</a>

                                            An organism cannot exist when they are living alone. An ecosystem should be composed of different organisms for it to survive. Just like you, in this lesson, you will describe the effects of interactions among organisms in their environment. These interactions may be either good or bad but always leading to a balance ecosystem. For instance, too much rats are harmful to the environment. To control their number, snakes and python may eat them and may result to a competition between the predators. 
Each interaction results in certain beneficial and harmful effects. Species interaction includes mutualism, commensalism, predation, and parasitism that keeps an ecosystem rich in different organisms. Competition happens when organisms compete for food, water, habitat, space, sunlight, and other things needed for survival. Predation is a prey– predator relationship. The animal which is bigger is called the predator that eats its prey, or the smaller animal. Predation is important as it helps other organisms to adapt in the environment, preventing itself to be eaten by other animals for their survival. 
There are two types of effects that may happen between or among organisms. It may be (1) short-term, like pollination and predation or (2) long-term by which both organisms often strongly influence the evolution of the species involved. Symbiosis is an example of a long-term effect of interaction. Symbioses range from mutualism which is beneficial to both partners or could be competition which is harmful to both partners. The organisms are called symbionts in a symbiotic relationship. 
These biological interactions are important in nature and in keeping the balance of nature. It maintains the food web. A food web shows the food relationship among living organisms and most food webs start with green plants. If biological interaction doesn't exist, many animals would die from starvation as the food web wouldn't exist.

                            12. ECOSYSTEMSEcosystems consist of living and non-living organisms in an area. These include plants, animals, microbes, and elements like soil, water, and air. The living organisms depend on both living and non-living aspects of an ecosystem.An ecosystem can be as small as a puddle or as big as an ocean. It is a very delicate balance, with these life forms sustaining one another. Disruptions to an ecosystem may prove disastrous to all its organisms. When a new plant or animal is suddenly placed in an ecosystem, it will surely compete with the original inhabitants for resources. This stranger may even push out the natural organisms, causing them to be extinct. The organisms that depended on the extinct organisms will definitely be affected.The balance in ecosystems have been unsettled by natural disasters such as fires, floods, storms, and volcanic eruptions. However, in recent years and ironically, in the name of progress, human activity has affected many ecosystems around the world.Questions1. Which among the following is NOT a good description for an ecosystem? a. animals and plants relying on each other to surviveb. a place where people are friendly to the environmentc. a biological community where organisms affect each otherd. a variety of living and non-living things in a particular area2. Why is an ecosystem considered to be a delicate balance? a. There are big ecosystems and small ecosystems that have to bebalanced.b. Not all ecosystems weigh the same so their weight needs to bedistributed.c. A change in an ecosystem can have tremendous effects on all itsorganisms.d. Different organisms always have equal importance in any given ecosystem. 3. Which of the following is NOT one of the natural disasters that have caused ecosystems to be unsettled?a. firesb. floodsc. stormsd. Humans4. Based on the selection, which of the following is true about human progress and ecosystems? a. Human progress sometimes causes ecosystems to suffer.b. Human activity promotes the development of ecosystems.c. Human activity helps find solutions to ecological problems.d. Human progress causes different ecosystems to be progressive.5.	According to the selection, a new organism introduced in an ecosystem can have an effect on an original inhabitant when _____.a. it fights with and eventually eats the original inhabitantb. it consumes resources intended for the original inhabitantc. it makes the original inhabitant feel strange in the ecosystemd. it contributes to disasters that upset the balance in the system6. What should human beings do in order to maintain the balance indifferent ecosystems? a. Cut down a lot of trees so that there is more space for animals to live in.b. Take corals from the sea so that fish would have more freedom to swim.c. Plant more trees in order to replace those that have been cut down.d. Catch a lot of tuna so that nothing will eat the mackerel or the small fish.7. The diagram below shows an ocean ecosystem. The arrows point to the food source of the succeeding organism. If a new organism is introduced into the system and it eats the shrimplike creatures, how will this indirectly affect the mackerel? a. The mackerel will have no more shrimplike creatures to eat.b. The mackerel will still be eaten by the tuna fish as it continues toconsume the small fish.c. The mackerel will be eaten by the small fish which now has to look for a new food source.d. The mackerel might lose its food since without a food source, the smallfish could die.8.Using the same diagram, which of the following statements is FALSE? a. The small fish depends solely on shrimplike creatures for food.b. The tuna fish depends solely on the mackerel as its food source.c. The large shark depends solely on the tuna fish as its food source.d. The shrimplike creatures depend solely on one-celled life for food​​</h2><br />

                            19. Read the selection and explain how comparison and contrast is shown.(5 points each)Example:1. An experiment with dogs suggests that our canine pals, much like ourselves, differ in their attitude toward life: Some dogs are pessimists while others appear to be optimists. In an experiment at a British veterinary school, researchers placed bowls of food in a regular location and got dogs used to finding their dinner there. The researchers then placed a consistently empty bowl in a separate location with a second, food-filled bowl placed between the two. Some dogs, when led to the empty bowl, would just give up if no food was present. These were the pessimists. The optimists, however, having experienced a reward on previous occasions, would keep looking and eventually locate the bowl in the middle. The dogs labeled pessimistic also grew anxious if separated from their owners. They would bark, chew things, and urinate inappropriately. The optimistic dogs, however, tended to fall asleep when left alone. They also greeted strangers as possible substitute playmates. In contrast, the pessimistic dogs would react to strangers with fear and aggression. Answer; Some dogs are optimists and some are pessimists. They differ in several ways.2. There are several characteristics which distinguish plants from animals. Green plants are able to manufacture their own food from substances in the environment. This process is known as photosynthesis. In contrast, animals, including man, get their food either directly from plants or indirectly by eating animals which have eaten plants. Plants are generally stationary. Animals, on the other hand, can usually move about. In external appearance, plants are usually green. They grow in a branching fashion at their extremities, and their growth continues throughout their lives. Animals, however, are very diverse in their external appearance. Their growth pattern is not limited to their extremities. It is evenly distributed and only occurs in a definite time period. Therefore, the difference between plants and animals is quite significant Answer:3. Although I raised Marcee and Obbie since they were puppies, they have completely diverse personalities. Obbie is a six- year old, male, toy Pomeranian whereas Marcee is a one- year old, female, Boston terrier. Obbie is small and soft, unlike Marcee who has bristly hair and is much bigger. Marcee insists on sleeping on the bed, under the covers every night. On the other hand, Obbie will only sleep on the floor, under the bed. Obbie is tremendously loyal and uptight; however, Marcee is hyper and friendly to anyone she meets or sees. Around other dogs, Marcee cowers to the larger dog, yet Obbie will always stand his ground, never giving up until he is scolded. Given that they were both treated the same way all their lives, it is hard to believe that they are so different in everything they do. Answer:​</h2><br />

                            20. An organism cannot exist when they are living alone. An ecosystem should be composed of different organisms for it to survive. Just like you, in this lesson, you will describe the effects of interactions among organisms in their environment. These interactions may be either good or bad but always leading to a balance ecosystem. For instance, too much rats are harmful to the environment. To control their number, snakes and python may eat them and may result to a competition between the predators. 
Each interaction results in certain beneficial and harmful effects. Species interaction includes mutualism, commensalism, predation, and parasitism that keeps an ecosystem rich in different organisms. Competition happens when organisms compete for food, water, habitat, space, sunlight, and other things needed for survival. Predation is a prey– predator relationship. The animal which is bigger is called the predator that eats its prey, or the smaller animal. Predation is important as it helps other organisms to adapt in the environment, preventing itself to be eaten by other animals for their survival. 
There are two types of effects that may happen between or among organisms. It may be (1) short-term, like pollination and predation or (2) long-term by which both organisms often strongly influence the evolution of the species involved. Symbiosis is an example of a long-term effect of interaction. Symbioses range from mutualism which is beneficial to both partners or could be competition which is harmful to both partners. The organisms are called symbionts in a symbiotic relationship. 
These biological interactions are important in nature and in keeping the balance of nature. It maintains the food web. A food web shows the food relationship among living organisms and most food webs start with green plants. If biological interaction doesn't exist, many animals would die from starvation as the food web wouldn't exist.
