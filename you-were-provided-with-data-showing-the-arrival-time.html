                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>After you were given the data from three seismic stations, what would be able to determine after looking at the arrival time of the P and S waves?  <p>
</p><p>The <strong>recorded</strong> data from the three stations will allow you to determine the location of the<strong> earthquake’s epicenter,</strong> so my answer would be letter d. This is done by using a compass and a single map that covers the three areas around where the seismographs were located. To get the data before you can use the compass, one has to take a look at what the seismograph provided.
</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong>The steps one will take after receiving the data from the three locations:
</strong></p>First, get your pencil and determine and mark the first vibration or the P-wave. This will appear as a quick spike <strong>recorded</strong> by the seismograph from one of the three locations provided.
Then follow the vertically written seismograph line until you reach the second spike or major vibration and mark that as your S-wave.
With this, since the seismic data has been divided into seconds, you can now write down how many seconds took place between the P and S-waves.
These steps will be repeated in all three locations.
<p>
</p><p><strong>Now it is time to fill-in the Data table which will contain the following columns:
</strong></p>P-wave arrival time
S-wave arrival time
Lag time (S-wave - Pwave=Lag)
The distance from the city or town (this is done using a graph, this will also let you know how wide will open your compass based on the unit chart at the bottom of the map)
<p>
</p><p>After completing the steps above, you can now use the compass to make three circles around the map with each circle’s center being the location where the seismograph<strong> recorded </strong>the data. Wherever they meet will be the epicenter of the earthquake.

The location of the epicenter. </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Scientists use <strong>triangulation</strong> to find the <strong>epicenter</strong> of an earthquake. When seismic data is collected from at <strong>least three different locations</strong>, it can be used to <strong>determine the epicenter</strong> by where it intersects. Every earthquake is recorded on numerous seismographs located in different directions.</p><br />

                        P waves will always be the first to arrive because it passes to everywall unlike s waves that only passes through the surfaces of earth. hope it helps. :)<br /><br /><br />
