                                            ACTIVITY 1: LEAVE A MARK! Directions: Read the passage below. Write TRUE if the statement is correct and FALSE if not. Because intimate details of our lives can be posted so easily, we often don't use the filters Social networking sites encourage us to be more public about our personal lives. we might normally employ when talking about our private life . What's more , the things we post remain available indefinitely. While at the moment, a photo of friends doing shots at a party may seem harmless, the image may appear less attractive in the context of an employer doing a background check. While most sites allow their users to control who sees the things they posted, such limitations are often forgotten. 1. Social media always keeps our personal lives in private. 2. Users may update social media with any details about their lives. 3. We must give limitations on what we share on social media sites. 4. Social media is the fast and easy avenue to tell the world about our lives. 5. We can control who can only see our online posts. 6. Some users forget to manage who can only see their online posts. 7. We can keep our posts private if we want to. 8. Online viewers may give different interpretations of what you post online. 9. Viewing and posting on social media are limitless. 10. We need to be careful on using any social media platforms.​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>
I have learned that communication is a way for all of us to express oneself and that this module had opened my eyes to deeper understanding of the topic communication. I discovered that I too, subconsciously communicate with my family with not just words, but gestures, expressions and signs too. I also would always keep in mind to make my words simple and easy to understand to avoid misunderstandings and conflicts.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>NATURE AND PROCESS</p><p></p><p>•Human beings are poor communicators but our communicative competence can be improved by learning and practising effective communication skills.</p><p>•Communication has a symbolic nature and is an act of sharing one’s ideas, emotions, attitudes, or perceptions with another person or group of persons through words (written or spoken), gestures, signals, signs, or other modes of transmitting images. The transmission of ideas always encounters barriers that reduce its effectiveness.</p><p>•The essential elements of the process of communication are the message, the sender, encoding, the channel, the receiver, decoding, acting on the message, the feedback, and the communication environment.</p><p>•Both the sender and the receiver play a role in making communication effective. The sender should encode the message accurately after considering the level, expectations, and needs of the target audience (receiver); the receiver should listen or read carefully to try to understand the intended meaning of the sender.</p><p>•The universal, common elements of communication are the communication environment, the use of symbols, and the presence of mental filters.</p><p>•Some basic facts about communication are that perfect communication is impossible; the meaning of a message is in the mind/perception of the receiver; and personality affects the effectiveness of communication.</p><p>•To communicate effectively, one should develop not only skills, but also a sense of empathy with others.</p><p></p><p>#CARRY ON LEARNER.</p><p>#MARK AS A BRAINLEST.</p><p>#THANKS ME LATER.</p><br />

                            9. ACTIVITY 1: LEAVE A MARK! Directions: Read the passage below. Write TRUE if the statement is correct and FALSE if not. Because intimate details of our lives can be posted so easily, we often don't use the filters Social networking sites encourage us to be more public about our personal lives. we might normally employ when talking about our private life . What's more , the things we post remain available indefinitely. While at the moment, a photo of friends doing shots at a party may seem harmless, the image may appear less attractive in the context of an employer doing a background check. While most sites allow their users to control who sees the things they posted, such limitations are often forgotten. 1. Social media always keeps our personal lives in private. 2. Users may update social media with any details about their lives. 3. We must give limitations on what we share on social media sites. 4. Social media is the fast and easy avenue to tell the world about our lives. 5. We can control who can only see our online posts. 6. Some users forget to manage who can only see their online posts. 7. We can keep our posts private if we want to. 8. Online viewers may give different interpretations of what you post online. 9. Viewing and posting on social media are limitless. 10. We need to be careful on using any social media platforms.​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>THE BASICS</p><p>Characterization: The ways individual characters are represented by the narrator or author of a text. This includes descriptions of the characters’ physical appearances, personalities, actions, interactions, and dialogue.</p><p>Dialogue: Spoken exchanges between characters in a dramatic or literary work, usually between two or more speakers.</p><p>Genre: A kind of literature. For instance, comedy, mystery, tragedy, satire, elegy, romance, and epic are all genres. Texts frequently draw elements from multiple genres to create dynamic narratives. Alastair Fowler uses the following elements to define genres: organizational features (chapters, acts, scenes, stanzas); length; mood (the Gothic novel tends to be moody and dark); style (a text can be high, low, or in-between depending on its audience); the reader’s role (readers of a mystery are expected to interpret evidence); and the author’s reason for writing (an epithalamion is a poem composed for marriage) (Mickics 132-3).</p><p>Imagery: A term used to describe an author’s use of vivid descriptions “that evoke sense-impressions by literal or figurative reference to perceptible or ‘concrete’ objects, scenes, actions, or states” (Baldick 121). Imagery can refer to the literal landscape or characters described in a narrative or the theoretical concepts an author employs.</p><p>Plot: The sequence of events that occur through a work to produce a coherent narrative or story.</p><p>Point of View: The perspective (visual, interpretive, bias, etc.) a text takes when presenting its plot and narrative. For instance, an author might write a narrative from a specific character’s point of view, which means that that character is our narrative and readers experience events through his or her eyes.</p><p>Style: Comprising an author’s diction, syntax, tone, characters, and other narrative techniques, “style” is used to describe the way an author uses language to convey his or her ideas and purpose in writing. An author’s style can also be associated to the genre or mode of writing the author adopts, such as in the case of a satire or elegy with would adopt a satirical or elegiac style of writing.</p><p>Symbol(ism): An object or element incorporated into a narrative to represent another concept or concern. Broadly, representing one thing with another. Symbols typically recur throughout a narrative and offer critical, though often overlooked, information about events, characters, and the author’s primary concerns in telling the story.</p><p>Theme: According to Baldick, a theme may be defined as “a salient abstract idea that emerges from a literary work’s treatment of its subject-matter; or a topic recurring in a number or literary works” (Baldick 258). Themes in literature tend to differ depending on author, time period, genre, style, purpose, etc.</p><p>Tone: A way of communicating information (in writing, images, or sound) that conveys an attitude. Authors convey tone through a combination of word-choice, imagery, perspective, style, and subject matter. By adopting a specific tone, authors can help readers accurately interpret meaning in a text.</p><p>Types of narrative: The narrator is the voice telling the story or speaking to the audience. However, this voice can come from a variety of different perspectives, including:</p><p>First person: A story told from the perspective of one or several characters, each of whom typically uses the word “I.” This means that readers “see” or experience events in the story through the narrator’s eyes.</p><p>Second person: A narrative perspective that typically addresses that audience using “you.” This mode can help authors address readers and invest them in the story.</p><p>Third person: Describes a narrative told from the perspective of an outside figure who does not participate directly in the events of a story. This mode uses “he,” “she,” and “it” to describe events and characters.</p><p>TYPES OF PROSE TEXTS</p><p>Bildungsroman: This is typically a type of novel that depicts an individual’s coming-of-age through self-discovery and personal knowledge. Such stories often explore the protagonists’ psychological and moral development. Examples include Dickens’ Great Expectations and Joyce’s A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man.</p><p>Epistolary: A novel composed primarily of letters sent and received by its principal characters. This type of novel was particularly popular during the eighteenth century.</p><p>Essay: According to Baldick, “a short written composition in prose that discusses a subject or proposes an argument without claiming to be a complete or thorough exposition” (Baldick 87). A notable example of the essay form is Jonathan Swift’s “A Modest Proposal,” which uses satire to discuss eighteenth-century economic and social concerns in Ireland.</p><p>Novella: An intermediate-length (between a novel and a short story) fictional narrative.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p>Answer:</p><p>Communication is the act of conveying meanings from one entity or group to another through the use of mutually understood signs, symbols, and semiotic rules. Being able to communicate effectively is perhaps the most important of all life skills. It is what enables us to pass information to other people, and to understand what is said to us and Communication serves 4 major functions and these are:</p><p>A.)Control- it is considered as a behaviour of human being because it has one objective and it is to deliver message effectively from one individual to another individual or group, and we're always using this when we are communicating. control is quite important because without this we cant keep the whole system running smoothly. Essential and effective information exchange at several points in the process is what keeps the control process running.</p><p>B.)Motivation- it refers to a person using a language to express desires, needs, wants likes and dislikes,inclinations,choices,aspirations. We use communication to obtain our need and if we cannot, we feel powerless.</p><p>C.)Emotional Expression- this can be very spontaneous because people are emotional beings. As humans,we feel and we communicate with our feelings. It is part of our human nature to communicate our emotions through whatever outlets. Communicating positive affections such as love,care, concern for others will most of the time solidify relationships.</p><p>D.)Information- these are definite knowledge or supplied about something or somebody, Information is one of the most important things in our modern societt. When we get informed about something we get knowledge . This knowledge protect us from making a mistakes. Life is a hard task and we need help while making decisions on our regular basis.</p><p></p><br />

A lot of netizens posted on how the process of solving itself is wrong as division by zero is not allowed. Now, what do you think is the reason why division by zero leads to an indeterminate answer? ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Step-by-step explanation:</strong></p><p>We all know that Multiplication and division are related. For example, 10÷2= 5. So, 5 x2 = 10. If we try to divide a number by 0, like 2÷0= undefined or (x). 0 × x= isn't 2. A number multipled by 0 is always 0. That's why it's not allowed. It will cause confusion. </p><br />

K-W-L stands for "Know", "Want to Know", and "Learned".
