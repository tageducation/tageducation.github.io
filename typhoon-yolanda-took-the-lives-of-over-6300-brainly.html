                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Why there were so many casualties even when they were warned of a storm surge beforehand by the officials (Typhoon Haiyan or Yolanda):
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There are many casualties because of the lack of preparedness not just by the disaster group of Tacloban but all the people who has experienced Yolanda's wrath. There would be a notice from other government agencies and authorities, but the hurricane is too strong and people are not prepared enough when the hurricane hit the land mass of Tacloban. Also, the places where evacuees take shelter has been wiped out by the surge combined with strong winds and floodings. Families take refuge on churches and high places, but unfortunately all places has almost destroyed by forces of nature. It was really one of the worst disaster ever happened on earth.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Typhoon Haiyan, known in the Philippines as Super Typhoon Yolanda, was one of the most powerful tropical cyclones ever recorded. On making landfall, Haiyan devastated portions of Southeast Asia, particularly the Philippines.[1] It is one of the deadliest Philippine typhoons on record,[2] killing at least 6,300 people in that country alone.[3] In terms of JTWC-estimated 1-minute sustained winds, Haiyan is tied with Meranti in 2016 for being the second strongest landfalling tropical cyclone on record. In January 2014, bodies were still being found.</p><br />

To​</h2><br />
                        <p>One reason why so many people were killed or injured during Typhoon Yolanda is that the storm surge was much larger and more powerful than what people were expecting. While there were warnings of a storm surge, many people did not fully understand the danger that it posed. Some people may have thought that they would be safe in their homes or in other structures that they believed were strong enough to withstand the winds and waves. Others may have been unable to evacuate due to a lack of transportation or other resources. When the storm surge hit, it swept away everything in its path, including buildings, vehicles, and people. The force of the water was so strong that it was able to knock down concrete walls and carry large objects for long distances.</p><p></p><p>Another reason why so many people were killed or injured during Typhoon Yolanda is that the Philippines is a country that is particularly vulnerable to natural disasters. The country is located in an area of the world that is prone to typhoons, earthquakes, and other hazards. Many people in the country live in informal settlements or in poorly constructed housing, which makes them more vulnerable to the effects of disasters. Additionally, the country's infrastructure is not always equipped to withstand the impact of natural disasters. Roads may be washed out, bridges may be destroyed, and communication systems may be disrupted. This can make it difficult for rescue workers to reach affected areas and for people to receive the help they need. All of these factors combined made it particularly challenging to respond to the disaster and to prevent the loss of life that occurred.</p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>The disaster group in Tacloban, as well as all those who have been affected by Yolanda's wrath, have failed to prepare adequately, which has resulted in a large number of casualties. Other government agencies and authorities would send out a warning, but the hurricane was too strong and people weren't prepared enough when it hit Tacloban. In addition, the surge, strong winds, and flooding have destroyed the shelters used by evacuees. Families seek refuge in churches and other high places, but the forces of nature have unfortunately almost destroyed all of them. It was without a doubt one of the world's worst disasters.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p>Why there were so many casualties even when they were warned of a storm surge beforehand by the officials (Typhoon Haiyan or Yolanda):
</p><p>
</p><p>There are many casualties because of the lack of preparedness not just by the disaster group of Tacloban but all the people who has experienced Yolanda's wrath. There would be a notice from other government agencies and authorities, but the hurricane is too strong and people are not prepared enough when the hurricane hit the land mass of Tacloban. Also, the places where evacuees take shelter has been wiped out by the surge combined with strong winds and floodings. Families take refuge on churches and high places, but unfortunately all places has almost destroyed by forces of nature. It was really one of the worst disaster ever happened on earth.
