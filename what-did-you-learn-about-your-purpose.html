Before, an audio can be created and transmitted through tape, radio, or CD. Today, a different alternative is offered by the Internet - the podcast. You may have encountered the term in your previous lesson in Listening Strategies. It is a digital audio file that is posted on the Internet. For you to practice the guidelines in conducting an interview, interview an expert on any field (Example: teacher, nurse, engineer, etc.). Imagine you will produce a 5-minute informative podcast about your interviewee's expertise 1. First, copy and accomplish the template on "Interview Plan" in your paper. Then, provide the interviewee with a copy of the interview questions to allow him/her to prepare answers. Remember to use open-ended questions. (Example: What advice would you give someone who like to follow a similar career to yours?) Interview Plan Interviewer Purpose of interview: Interviewee:Information I know about the Interviewee: Job Position/Title: Workplace: Years in service/practice: Others: Possible Questions: 1. 2.3.4.5.Answers:1.2.3.4.5.2. If a smartphone or any sound recorder is available, you can use it to record the interview. You can use your recording to complete the last part of your Interview Plan where you will write your interviewee's answers. Remember to use a direct speech or write the exact answers of your interviewee. 3. After the interview, reflect on the questions that follow. Write your answers on your paper. ►► What was it like to interview someone? ►►Which of the tips or guidelines did you use, and how did it help you as an interviewer? ►► GOOD AND HELPFUL ANSWER = BRAINLIEST ►►NONSENSE ANSWER = REPORT!! ​</a>

1.This second trimester, you have added a lot of tek-bok writing to the entirety of your SHS study that you personally created for the Filipino Writing in Selected Fields course. It is now time to view or analyze your writings and evaluate yourself as a writer. Perform the following tasks (two parts) as part of your Expected Performance No.1 (P. T. # 1).
A. Part One: Choose THREE of your written essays in the Writing Filipino in Selected Fields (Tek-Bok) course that you would like to reflect on your writing experience. You need to compose a paragraph outlining your reflection on each of the writings you choose (because you need to choose three so in total there are three paragraphs). You can use and base the following questions to get ideas about the reflection you are going to write. However, each reflection must be in the form of a paragraph with a main idea. Make or write your reflection with an impact on the reader and not just answer the questions.
Why did you choose to write this?
What do you see as your strengths as a writer in this writing?
What important thing for you did you see when you wrote this article?
In what areas or parts of the writing did you have difficulty writing this essay?
If you were to further develop the writing of this essay, what would you do? Why?
 B. Part Two: Answering questions related to the topic: “Who Am I As A Writer?”. Answer the following questions as a reflection of your being a writer.
 1. Of the THREE writings you have chosen for your presented reflection or reflection on your writing experience, which one for you is your best work? Why?
 2. After looking at or evaluating your THREE writing choices, what do you see as your main strengths as a writer? Why?
 3. What do you think readers will learn about you (in dreams or purpose in life / in dealing with problems / in developing skills / in your personality or behavior / in expressing experiences, feelings, opinions , or outlook on life) from your tek-bok writing creations?

Before, an audio can be created and transmitted through tape, radio, or CD. Today, a different alternative is offered by the Internet - the podcast. You may have encountered the term in your previous lesson in Listening Strategies. It is a digital audio file that is posted on the Internet. For you to practice the guidelines in conducting an interview, interview an expert on any field (Example: teacher, nurse, engineer, etc.). Imagine you will produce a 5-minute informative podcast about your interviewee's expertise 1. First, copy and accomplish the template on "Interview Plan" in your paper. Then, provide the interviewee with a copy of the interview questions to allow him/her to prepare answers. Remember to use open-ended questions. (Example: What advice would you give someone who like to follow a similar career to yours?)

If a smartphone or any sound recorder is available, you can use it to record the interview. You can use your recording to complete the last part of your Interview Plan where you will write your interviewee's answers. Remember to use a direct speech or write the exact answers of your interviewee. 3. After the interview, reflect on the questions that follow. Write your answers on your paper. ►► What was it like to interview someone? ►►Which of the tips or guidelines did you use, and how did it help you as an interviewer? ►► GOOD AND HELPFUL ANSWER = BRAINLIEST ►►NONSENSE ANSWER = REPORT!! ​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:What Is an Expository Essay?
</strong></p><p><strong>An essay that explains a writer’s ideas by defining, explaining, informing, or elaborating on points to allow the reader to clearly understand the concept.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Many of your future academic workplace writing assignments will be expository–explaining your ideas or the significance of a concept or action. An expository essay allows the writer the opportunity to explain his or her ideas about a topic and to provide clarity for the reader by using:
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Facts
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Explanations
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Details
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Definitions
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>It may also include the writer outlining steps of a procedure in a way that is straightforward for the reader to follow. It is purely informative and often contains elements of summary.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Imagine you need to verbally explain a concept to your classmates, maybe a behavioural theory. What are the key elements on which you would focus? How would you organize the information? You could explain who came up with the theory, the specific area of study to which it is related, its purpose, and the significant details to explain the theory. Telling these four elements to your classmates would give them a complete, yet summarized, picture of the theory, so they could apply the theory in future discussions.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Although you did this verbally, you were still fulfilling the elements of an expository essay by providing definition, details, explanations, and maybe even facts if you have a really good memory. This is the same process that you would use when you write an expository essay. You may actually be doing this all the time; for example, when you are giving someone directions to a place or explaining how to cook something. In the following sections of the chapter, you will practise doing this more in different expository written forms.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>The Structure of an Expository Essay
</strong></p><p><strong>Sections versus Paragraphs
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Before looking at the general structure of an expository essay, you first need to know that in your post-secondary education, you should not consider your essay as writing being constructed with five paragraphs as you might have been used to in high school. You should instead think of your essay in terms of sections (there may be five), and each section may have multiple paragraphs.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>To understand further why you need to think beyond the five-paragraph essay, imagine you have been asked to submit a six-page paper (approximately 1,500 words). You already know that each paragraph should be roughly 75 to 200 words long. If you divide the required word count by five paragraphs (1,500 by 5), you end with 300 words per paragraph, way above the number you should have in a paragraph. If your paragraphs are too long, they likely have too many ideas and your reader may become confused. Your paragraphs should be two-third of a page at most, and never longer than a page.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Instead, if you think of your essays being divided into sections (with possibly more than one paragraph per section), your writing will likely be more organized and allow your reader to follow your presentation of ideas without creating too much distance between your paragraph’s supporting points and its topic sentence.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>As you will see in Section 4.5: Classification, some essay forms may require even more than five paragraphs or sections because of how many points are necessary to address. . For the rest of this chapter, the term paragraph will also imply section.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Sections of an Expository Essay
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>An expository essay, regardless of its purpose, should have at least five sections, which are:
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Introduction
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>First body section/paragraph
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Second body section/paragraph
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Third body section/paragraph
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Conclusion.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>The introduction should state the topic of your paper: your thesis statement as well as brief signposts of what information the rest of the paper will include. That is, you only want to mention the content of the body paragraphs; you do not want to go in to a lot of detail and repeat what will be in the rest of the essay.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>The first body section or paragraph should focus on one of your main points and provide evidence to support that point. There should be two to three supporting points: reasons, facts, statistics, quotations, examples, or a mix of these. Both the second and third body sections should follow the same pattern. Providing three body sections with one point each that supports the thesis should provide the reader with enough detail to be convinced of your argument or fully understand the concept you are explaining. However, remember that some sections will require more explanation, and you may need to separate this information into multiple paragraphs.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>You can order your sections in the most logical way to explain your ideas. For example, if you are describing a process, you may use chronological order to show the definite time order in which the steps need to happen. You will learn about the different ways to organize your body paragraphs in the next chapter.

1.This second trimester, you have added a lot of tek-bok writing to the entirety of your SHS study that you personally created for the Filipino Writing in Selected Fields course. It is now time to view or analyze your writings and evaluate yourself as a writer. Perform the following tasks (two parts) as part of your Expected Performance No.1 (P. T. # 1).
A. Part One: Choose THREE of your written essays in the Writing Filipino in Selected Fields (Tek-Bok) course that you would like to reflect on your writing experience. You need to compose a paragraph outlining your reflection on each of the writings you choose (because you need to choose three so in total there are three paragraphs). You can use and base the following questions to get ideas about the reflection you are going to write. However, each reflection must be in the form of a paragraph with a main idea. Make or write your reflection with an impact on the reader and not just answer the questions.
Why did you choose to write this?
What do you see as your strengths as a writer in this writing?
What important thing for you did you see when you wrote this article?
In what areas or parts of the writing did you have difficulty writing this essay?
If you were to further develop the writing of this essay, what would you do? Why?
 B. Part Two: Answering questions related to the topic: “Who Am I As A Writer?”. Answer the following questions as a reflection of your being a writer.
 1. Of the THREE writings you have chosen for your presented reflection or reflection on your writing experience, which one for you is your best work? Why?
 2. After looking at or evaluating your THREE writing choices, what do you see as your main strengths as a writer? Why?
 3. What do you think readers will learn about you (in dreams or purpose in life / in dealing with problems / in developing skills / in your personality or behavior / in expressing experiences, feelings, opinions , or outlook on life) from your tek-bok writing creations?

                        <p><strong>TWO THINGS THAT MAKE ME THE HAPPIEST TIMES:</strong></p><strong>Making people I love happy</strong> is one of my life goals. If we knew our time to stay in this world for a while, what would I make use of the remaining short time? the answer is clear, wanting to <strong>spend time with the people we care about and make them all happy</strong> starting from the simplest things.Another simple thing is <strong>to make my friends happy</strong> when they feel stressed or sad, because the saddest point of a friend is when we can't be a place to share his happiness or his sadness. Making a friend happy starts from listening to his complaints, giving good suggestions when he is unsure of his choice or needs a shoulder to talk to by lightening his burden, or maybe helping him/her if we can do that. The most important thing is that as a friend I must always support their every choice and not let them despair, there is always a way to encourage them back through treatment or just small words but it turns out that those words mean a lot to someone.<p></p><p><strong>THINGS I LEARNED FROM MY LIFE GOALS:</strong></p><p><strong>1. Focus on the things that make me happy</strong></p><p>According to <strong>Patrick Ness</strong>, one cannot write a life story with just words. But we need to instill the actions that matter to us. By doing activities and actions that I consider important, I can achieve the life goals we want. The meaning of life does not guarantee my happiness. But when I do what we think is important, I feel happier and more satisfied with my life.</p><p></p><p><strong>2. Asking These 3 Things To Determine Your Life Goals</strong></p><p>Before deciding on the right life goal, I need to know a few questions. This question is very powerful and will help me find a good purpose in life and according to my desires, such as the following:</p>What legacy do I want to leave for loved ones when we are not in this world?What will people feel and think when we are no longer in this world?How do I need to make a difference from other people's lives?<p></p><p><strong>3. Temporarily Reduce Social Media Use</strong></p><p>Too much connection with social media can expose me to other people's lives. So that often makes me easily jealous and not confident. For example, if I see a friend who is already successful and posts his achievements on social media.</p><p></p><p>---</p><p>Let's see more about happiest time of ones here:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/18543238</p><p></p><p>#SPJ2</p><br />
