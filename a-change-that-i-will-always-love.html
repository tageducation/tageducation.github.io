                                            I thought that you'd remember, but it seems that you forgot
It's hard for me to blame you when you were already lost
Oh, yeah, I'm tired of always waiting, oh, yeah, yeah
I see you changed your number, that's why you don't get my calls
I gave you all of me, now you don't wanna be involved
Oh, yeah, yeah, I really gotta face it, oh, yeah, yeah
I just wanna be the one
But to you, we're already done
Tell me, why'd you have to hit-and-run me?
Now I'm all alone crying ugly
You broke my heart just for fun
Took my love and just left me numb
Now it's eight in the morning
Hate in the morning (all because of you)
Another story that's sad and true
I can feel the pain, can you?
You had to be the one to let me down
To color me blue
Hate to see you with someone new
I'll put a curse on her and you
Ain't no looking back, now you're dead and gone
My love is gone too
All my love is go-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-one
All my love is go-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-one
All my love is go-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-one
All my love is gone
Now you're dead and gone
All my love is gone and the hate has grown
I'm standing all alone and I'm searching for something
But I can't feel nothing
I pack my bags and go, this don't feel like home
Too much darkness for a rainbow, I feel so used
How am I supposed to live without you? I refuse, yeah
I just wanna be the one
But to you, we're already done
Tell me, why'd you have to hit-and-run me?
Now I'm all alone crying ugly
You broke my heart just for fun
Took my love and just left me numb

And you, you are like a flower who grows every single day of your life. You are like an art that even it is not colourful and it is just simple, you can still call it a masterpiece. You are flawed by design, your imperfections is what makes you perfect. You deserve all the love and not to be swathe by dilemmas, that even though you were destructed by many, loving yourself is still eternity.I used to envy someone people for the fact that they have the things that I want. Will they call me plagiarist for the fact that I am trying to copy them because all people love them? Will they sue me for committing mistake and that is to hate someone because of too much envious of that person? Because of toxic high standards in our society I became someone that isn’t really me. And I realized something, as I keep on growing each day, starting to comprehend things everyday. I realized that—Never let their wordsmakes you doubt aboutyourself and change you.Never let their glancemakes you scared of them.Never let them take offyour self-confidence.And never let them controlyour decisions in life.“Do not change yourself for others and let others change for you. You don't need to adjust yourself just to fit yourself with them.”Today, I woke up loving thyself— negative thoughts already left and I am embracing myself for who really I am. Today, I’m starting to do what I really want for myself and what really makes me happy. I don’t need wings to fly because I am already a fairy, achieving my goals in life with my own hand. I don't need super power to attain everything that I want because I’ve realized that myself will never leave me and I don’t need someone for I have myself. Today, I don’t need to envy those perfect character in the noble that I always read, I became happy in my life knowing that I am the leading lady of my own story.I’ve realized that I don’t need someone to fulfill the things that I want because I have me. I am the writer of my life and I am the one who’s doing my fate. Today, I am looking at the mirror, I’m happy knowing that this is me, the someone that I used to hate before is now loving herself for who really she was.​</a>

                                            Love Is All We NeedThe world will be a better place if there is love. V.B. Feliciano said "Love is the most powerful thing in the world. It can change you, your world, and your life." Love can make you the happiest person and it teaches you how to be someone. Love is the least understood part of human life. Some people think that love is complicated because it breaks your heart. However, I believe that love is all we need because it encourages us to be the greatest, it makes our life better, and it teaches us to be stronger and more optimistic.I can relate the quote to a movie entitled "A Walk to Remember" where the power of love prevailed between Landon and Jaime. From a bad boy in high school, Landon became a good man for Jaime even if it meant he have to leave his friends. Jaime's love taught Landon so many things by granting some of Jaime's wishes. Even if he knew that Jaime will be gone due to sickness, he cared and loved her all through out.I personally believe in the power of love for so many reasons. First of all, love encourages us to be the greatest. People are influenced by the person they spend the most time with. Being with their loved ones makes them feel special. Because of this, it inspires and motivates them to be the best they can be. Secondly. love makes our life better. It adds color to our life. It makes us the happiest person on earth, Finally, love teaches us to be stronger and more optimistic. Love gives you hope when you're down. It gives you light when all you can see is darkness.In conclusion, love is we need because it gives your life a meaning. It teaches you a lot of lessons that can help you in your life. Love can change you and your life to a better one. Sometimes, it may seem complicated but always remember that giving up is not an option. Love gives you a positive attitude and it makes you the best version of yourself. You could always give without loving, but you can never love without giving.Question :1. what does the thesis statement of the author? 2. What does the author say about the relationship of love and giving. 3. What was the attendant grabber used by the author? 4. What paragraph reveals the relation of the topic (numerical answer) 5.

I gave you all of me, now you don't wanna be involved
Oh, yeah, yeah, I really gotta face it, oh, yeah, yeah
I just wanna be the one
But to you, we're already done
Tell me, why'd you have to hit-and-run me?

You broke my heart just for fun
Took my love and just left me numb
Now it's eight in the morning
Hate in the morning (all because of you)
Another story that's sad and true
I can feel the pain, can you?
You had to be the one to let me down
To color me blue
Hate to see you with someone new
I'll put a curse on her and you
Ain't no looking back, now you're dead and gone

All my love is gone and the hate has grown
I'm standing all alone and I'm searching for something
But I can't feel nothing
I pack my bags and go, this don't feel like home
Too much darkness for a rainbow, I feel so used
How am I supposed to live without you? I refuse, yeah
I just wanna be the one
But to you, we're already done
Tell me, why'd you have to hit-and-run me?

                            10. Do not envy those people who were born great but rather, make yourself great through hardwork. Perhaps, we all grow through the process. Just like the flower, it needs proper care, right amount of water until it grows and becomes a beautiful flower that everyone will admire it. And you, you are like a flower who grows every single day of your life. You are like an art that even it is not colourful and it is just simple, you can still call it a masterpiece. You are flawed by design, your imperfections is what makes you perfect. You deserve all the love and not to be swathe by dilemmas, that even though you were destructed by many, loving yourself is still eternity.I used to envy someone people for the fact that they have the things that I want. Will they call me plagiarist for the fact that I am trying to copy them because all people love them? Will they sue me for committing mistake and that is to hate someone because of too much envious of that person? Because of toxic high standards in our society I became someone that isn’t really me. And I realized something, as I keep on growing each day, starting to comprehend things everyday. I realized that—Never let their wordsmakes you doubt aboutyourself and change you.Never let their glancemakes you scared of them.Never let them take offyour self-confidence.And never let them controlyour decisions in life.“Do not change yourself for others and let others change for you. You don't need to adjust yourself just to fit yourself with them.”Today, I woke up loving thyself— negative thoughts already left and I am embracing myself for who really I am. Today, I’m starting to do what I really want for myself and what really makes me happy. I don’t need wings to fly because I am already a fairy, achieving my goals in life with my own hand. I don't need super power to attain everything that I want because I’ve realized that myself will never leave me and I don’t need someone for I have myself. Today, I don’t need to envy those perfect character in the noble that I always read, I became happy in my life knowing that I am the leading lady of my own story.I’ve realized that I don’t need someone to fulfill the things that I want because I have me. I am the writer of my life and I am the one who’s doing my fate. Today, I am looking at the mirror, I’m happy knowing that this is me, the someone that I used to hate before is now loving herself for who really she was.​</h2><br />

I am the moon and I love to play a game, because I don't always look the same. In the beginning, I am new, out of sight from all of you. Sometimes I'm a crescent, up from here, smiling at you. Look up in a clear sky, You will see my friendly bright light. Can you guess what shape will I have when see me tonight?Guide Questions: 1. What is the poem all about? 2. What does the moon love to play? 3. What does the moon love to reflect? 4. What do you think is the reason, why does the moon change its appearance from night to night?​</h2><br />

The Moon doesn't emit (give off) light itself, the 'moonlight' we see is actually the Sun's light reflected off the lunar surface. So, as the Moon orbits the Earth, the Sun lights up different parts of it, making it seem as if the Moon is changing shape.</p><br />

                            19. Love Is All We NeedThe world will be a better place if there is love. V.B. Feliciano said "Love is the most powerful thing in the world. It can change you, your world, and your life." Love can make you the happiest person and it teaches you how to be someone. Love is the least understood part of human life. Some people think that love is complicated because it breaks your heart. However, I believe that love is all we need because it encourages us to be the greatest, it makes our life better, and it teaches us to be stronger and more optimistic.I can relate the quote to a movie entitled "A Walk to Remember" where the power of love prevailed between Landon and Jaime. From a bad boy in high school, Landon became a good man for Jaime even if it meant he have to leave his friends. Jaime's love taught Landon so many things by granting some of Jaime's wishes. Even if he knew that Jaime will be gone due to sickness, he cared and loved her all through out.I personally believe in the power of love for so many reasons. First of all, love encourages us to be the greatest. People are influenced by the person they spend the most time with. Being with their loved ones makes them feel special. Because of this, it inspires and motivates them to be the best they can be. Secondly. love makes our life better. It adds color to our life. It makes us the happiest person on earth, Finally, love teaches us to be stronger and more optimistic. Love gives you hope when you're down. It gives you light when all you can see is darkness.In conclusion, love is we need because it gives your life a meaning. It teaches you a lot of lessons that can help you in your life. Love can change you and your life to a better one. Sometimes, it may seem complicated but always remember that giving up is not an option. Love gives you a positive attitude and it makes you the best version of yourself. You could always give without loving, but you can never love without giving.Question :1. what does the thesis statement of the author? 2. What does the author say about the relationship of love and giving. 3. What was the attendant grabber used by the author? 4. What paragraph reveals the relation of the topic (numerical answer) 5.
