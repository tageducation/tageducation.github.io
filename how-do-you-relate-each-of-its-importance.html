The diagrams below illustrate several important properties of gravitational force. In each picture, the sizes of tñe arrows are proportional to the size of the forces between the objects. Assume that the larger the size of the object, the larger its mass. Study the diagrams. Then, answer the questions. A. С () B. C. ( ) O LOADS 1. Look at Figures A and B. What is the same in both pictures? 2. How do Figures A and B differ? 3. What important property of gravitational force is illustrated by Figures A and B? 4. Look at Figure C. How are the three pairs of objects different? 5. What property of gravitational force is illustrated by Figure C? 6. How do the two objects in Figure D differ from each other? 7. What does Figure D tell you about gravitational force? 8. Which diagram is most like the situation that exists when an apple falls to the ground? Why?​</a>

Many of you must feel robbed as we are al stuck in our homes forced to deal with at that is happening from a distance The pandemic has brought our lives to a halt like nothing else could competing to imagine our world anew. How do we navigate through the uncertainties posed by our time? The simple truth is that there are no ready-made answers for this question. None of us have gone through ma before. No one realy 100-percent ready for what comes next What I can say, however, is that I myself have gone through periods of uncertainty And my experiences have taught me to be at peace with the act of stepping into the unknown by anchoring mysed on two things looking outward and moving forward Look beyond ourselves names of cra, many will feel the urge to think only of ones to founder, and o retreat in cur anal comes of comfort. When the fateful plane crash took the life of my husband. Jesse, it turned my whole world and those of my children upside down But the way the nation grieved with us and the impact of the legacy Jesse left behind plucked me out of the shadows I realized that there are things greater than ourselves and that there are causes that will always be worth fighting for no matter Ilamed that shing back into our bubbles, allowing fear and get to paralyze us only leads in deeper despair.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Cultural Evolution It refers to the changes or development in cultures from a simple form to a more complex form of human culture. </p><p>Sociocultural evolution happens as a result of human adaptation to the different factors like changes in climates or in their environment and population increase.</p><p></p><p>2. The importance of Cultural and Sociocultural, is to know the simple form to a more complex form of human culture, and the environment and population in human adaptation. </p><p></p><p>3.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. The sum of the roots of a quadratic equation is equal to the negation of the coefficient of the second term, divided by the leading coefficient. The product of the roots of a quadratic equation is equal to the constant term (the third term), divided by the leading coefficient.</p><p><strong>Step-by-step explanation:</strong></p><p>2. These are called the roots of the quadratic equation. For a quadratic equation ax2+bx+c = 0, the sum of its roots = –b/a and the product of its roots = c/a. A quadratic equation may be expressed as a product of two binomials.</p><p></p><p>3. When you're dealing with quadratic equations, it can be really helpful to identify a, b, and c. These values are used to find the axis of symmetry, the discriminant, and even the roots using the quadratic formula.

Read Vice President Leni Robredo graduation message to Class of 2020 and identify its geographic and linguistic dimension Dearest Class of 2020 Congrats to you and to your proud parents for making this f I know this is not how you imagined your graduation to be-no applause, no IG worthy photos no partes, no big speeches. Many of you must feel robbed as we are al stuck in our homes forced to deal with at that is happening from a distance The pandemic has brought our lives to a halt like nothing else could competing to imagine our world anew. How do we navigate through the uncertainties posed by our time? The simple truth is that there are no ready-made answers for this question. None of us have gone through ma before. No one realy 100-percent ready for what comes next What I can say, however, is that I myself have gone through periods of uncertainty And my experiences have taught me to be at peace with the act of stepping into the unknown by anchoring mysed on two things looking outward and moving forward Look beyond ourselves names of cra, many will feel the urge to think only of ones to founder, and o retreat in cur anal comes of comfort. When the fateful plane crash took the life of my husband. Jesse, it turned my whole world and those of my children upside down But the way the nation grieved with us and the impact of the legacy Jesse left behind plucked me out of the shadows I realized that there are things greater than ourselves and that there are causes that will always be worth fighting for no matter Ilamed that shing back into our bubbles, allowing fear and get to paralyze us only leads in deeper despair.

That every food pack eases a bit of the burden on families who have lost their incomes. That every protective equipment aut makes a medical front-liner foul safer. That every palengke delivery made means that a market vendor and tricycle driver eam enough to put food on the table. This is how we can move forward + Furwant by regaining anchorage on amat, real things with real outcomes, ming one step after another as we strive to reach our goals. Forward knowing that doing aomeng for acmeone else can be a spul save for the cray that we c Forward, knowing that we are caled to do everything we can for the good of others especially those that need hep the most Looking outward and moving forward-this is how we can bravely face the new world. With passion and purpose. With grit and resolve Win compassion and with courage Dear graduates, no matter what the future holds, stay on the side of courage and be nopetal for better days.
