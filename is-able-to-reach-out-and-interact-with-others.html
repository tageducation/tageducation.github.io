                                            Lisa Gu visited the Philippines because she loves clear and pristine waters which the country is famous for. She went on a solo trip and planned to start her beach experience in Siargao Island. She arrived, brimming with excitement however she turned out seriously struggling to reach the hotel where she will be staying. It would have been helpful to her if she asked help from locals or authorities but Lisa is afraid of interacting with Filipinos. She has a belief that dark-skinned people have short temper and are likely to harm others if they get angry. She went on, walking in circles for hours and up in a Filipino restaurant. She saw a Korean tourist talking happily to a Filipino woman who appears to be the owner of the dining place. Witnessing how friendly and hospitable she is to the foreigner, Lisa felt regretful for misjudging Filipinos. She gathered enough confidence to ask help from the woman and instead of giving her the warm expression she was expecting, the woman gave her a cold message, "We don't accept Chinese people here. Because of you, COVID-19 arrived to the Philippines." Lisa heavy-heartedly retreated, too affected to speak a word. Lito, a Filipino resident in the area who happened to see everything, came forward and defended Lisa in the best polite way that he could, so his fellow Filipino would reflect on her actions. In the end, the woman apologized to Lisa which then was replied with words of gratitude from her. Lito and Lisa became friends and she opened up to him her negative judgments about Filipinos before which are now replaced with positive ones. 1.Who among the characters in the narrative is being biased? A.Lito B.Lisa C.Owner of the restaurant D.Both A and C 2. Who among the characters in the narrative has prejudice towards others? A.Lisa B.Owner of the restaurant C.Lito D.Both A and B 3.Write down a happening from the narrative in which a person is in the state of being blased. 4. Write down a happening from the narrative in which there is an existence of prejudice. 5. If you were Lito and you found out first about Lisa's negative views towards Filipinos, would you still defend her? Why? 6. Have you ever been hurt because of a biased treatment or were you judged by someone without even knowing you? How did it feel for you and how were you able to deal with it?  ​</a>

As a new teacher with a dialect different to her, Reez had to learn and understand the accent of her students so it would be easy for her to reach out to them. What she did was right. 6. If I allow my own perspectives on things to get in my way to learning, I am blocking the chance to learn new things from other people. 7.

                            19. Lisa Gu visited the Philippines because she loves clear and pristine waters which the country is famous for. She went on a solo trip and planned to start her beach experience in Siargao Island. She arrived, brimming with excitement however she turned out seriously struggling to reach the hotel where she will be staying. It would have been helpful to her if she asked help from locals or authorities but Lisa is afraid of interacting with Filipinos. She has a belief that dark-skinned people have short temper and are likely to harm others if they get angry. She went on, walking in circles for hours and up in a Filipino restaurant. She saw a Korean tourist talking happily to a Filipino woman who appears to be the owner of the dining place. Witnessing how friendly and hospitable she is to the foreigner, Lisa felt regretful for misjudging Filipinos. She gathered enough confidence to ask help from the woman and instead of giving her the warm expression she was expecting, the woman gave her a cold message, "We don't accept Chinese people here. Because of you, COVID-19 arrived to the Philippines." Lisa heavy-heartedly retreated, too affected to speak a word. Lito, a Filipino resident in the area who happened to see everything, came forward and defended Lisa in the best polite way that he could, so his fellow Filipino would reflect on her actions. In the end, the woman apologized to Lisa which then was replied with words of gratitude from her. Lito and Lisa became friends and she opened up to him her negative judgments about Filipinos before which are now replaced with positive ones. 1.Who among the characters in the narrative is being biased? A.Lito B.Lisa C.Owner of the restaurant D.Both A and C 2. Who among the characters in the narrative has prejudice towards others? A.Lisa B.Owner of the restaurant C.Lito D.Both A and B 3.Write down a happening from the narrative in which a person is in the state of being blased. 4. Write down a happening from the narrative in which there is an existence of prejudice. 5. If you were Lito and you found out first about Lisa's negative views towards Filipinos, would you still defend her? Why? 6. Have you ever been hurt because of a biased treatment or were you judged by someone without even knowing you? How did it feel for you and how were you able to deal with it?  ​</h2><br />
