Area of a squareAs we all know that diameter is 2 timesA= The raduis is one half of diameter.S= To find the side of the square we use this fomula S= and read as side of square is equal to the Square root of area. When we say square root, we are going to think of a number that if we are going to multiply it by itself 2 times, the result is the number inside the square root sign.S= 9 cm Step 2 Area of a circle A = pie A = 3.14 x ( x )A = 3.14 x A= Therefore the area of a circle isActivity 1Analyze and solve each problem. show your solution. 1.
