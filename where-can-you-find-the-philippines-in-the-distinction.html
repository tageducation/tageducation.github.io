The Sulu and Celebes Seas, the Pacific Ocean, the Bashi Channel, and the South China Sea form its western, eastern, southern, and northern borders, respectively. </p><p></p><p>The Philippines is a country in the eastern part of the planet. I infer from the comparison that one of our neighboring countries, the Philippines, has many of the same traits, cultures, and traditions as our own. such as exhibiting consideration for the elderly and loyalty to one's family or barangay. Thailand uses the “bow”, but Japan and Korea utilize the bow. In the Philippines, there is “mano po”. As a sign of respect, this step is taken. It is used even in Indonesia, where it is called as “salim”. </p><p></p><p>Even though we have certain things in common with our neighbors, we also have things that set us apart. The Philippines never had the chance to develop its own alphabet, Alibata, and instead adopted the English alphabets. The majority of Asian countries, such as Korea, China, Vietnam, Japan, and others, have their own alphabets. The most significant cultural effect on our society has come from Western cultures. The conversion of our country to Catholicism by the Spanish colonizers had a lasting impact on our country. Since the Americans, another Western nation, took over after the Spaniards, who ruled us for 300 years, we now have a blend of their languages, customs, and cultures in our own.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>To know more about Philippines, visit the link below</strong></p><p><strong>https://brainly.ph/question/2724669 </strong></p><p><strong>#SPJ4</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p>Even though I have never been to a Western country, I am pretty familiar with and have a <strong>view</strong> of how they live thanks to the films and television shows I watch. Streaming videos on YouTube and books are other options. I suppose I might say that the West is logical while the East is emotional. The culture of the East is frequently founded on the continuation of our shared past. There are cultural differences between nations and between regions. No two cultures can be identical.</p><p></p>Do you agree that the West and the East may be distinguished?<p>My sincere view is that it is. I wholeheartedly concur with the distinctions between the West and the East. The nations of the East and the West are blatantly diametrically <strong>opposed</strong> to one another, particularly in terms of culture and society.</p><p></p>What characteristics distinguish the Philippines from its neighbors in Asia?<p>The eastern section of the world includes the Philippines. I can conclude from the comparison that the Philippines, one of our neighboring nations, shares many of the same characteristics, cultures, and traditions. such as demonstrating regard for senior citizens and loyalty to one's family or barangay. The wai is used in Thailand, while the <strong>bow</strong> is used in Japan and Korea. <strong>Mano po</strong> exists in the Philippines. This action is performed as a show of respect. Even in Indonesia, where it is known as <strong>Salim</strong>, it is practiced. </p><p></p><p>This is the way neighbors affect one another. We are also traditional and sentimental people. We all have a strong sense of family. Asian nations all have the same personalities when it comes to being courteous, tolerant, laid back, and polite most of the time. We also grin more frequently than Westerners do.</p><p></p>Do the Philippines' many regions or ethnolinguistic groups differ from one another?<p>Indeed, there are variations among nations or ethnic groups. For instance, the <strong>spoken languages, well-known folklore, popular local goods, festivals, </strong>etc. The dialect is now considerably different if we simply move to a new city.</p><p></p><p>Even if we share some characteristics with our neighbors, we also differ from them. While the bulk of Asian nations, like Korea, China, Vietnam, Japan, and more, have their own alphabets, the Philippines never had the chance to develop its own alphabet, Alibata, and instead adopted the <strong>English alphabets</strong>. Western cultures have had the most cultural influence on our society. The Spanish colonizers left a significant mark on our nation by converting us to Catholicism. Given that the Spaniards, who occupied us for 300 years, were followed by the Americans, two Western nations, we have incorporated elements of their cultures, traditions, and language into our own.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Learn more about being a Filipino here:https://brainly.ph/question/1847756#</strong></p><p></p><p>#SPJ2</p><br />
