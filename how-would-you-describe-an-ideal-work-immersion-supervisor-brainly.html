I'll try to let go of the emotion and see each mistake as a new obstacle to overcome and a new lesson to learn. I will never hold someone responsible for my mistakes. I'll try to find out what went wrong and use it as a learning experience. My ultimate aim is to improve, develop, and evolve into a brilliantly better person. I'm in conflict with my target if I'm trying to stop rejection. We're all vulnerable, and we're all prone to making mistakes. Rejection does not imply that I am unworthy; rather, it indicates that I have room to improve. I will still look at things positively.</strong></p><p><strong>3.)

                            11. how would you describe your ideal church??​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>My ideal church is not a church, per se, it is the VERY modest worship place in the midst of a larger compound of also very modest structures that together serve as admin and supply headquarters for a local mission. The worship “center” is NOTHING to boast about; it may hardly have walls… but enough protection to keep the wind, rain, drifting snow, and very cold months out… The floor might not even be anything but dirt or mats on some dirt; but the dirt is soft enough to stand on barefoot, to sit on, the kneel on, to get on your face before the Lord on. It is not a fancy place. But people over the days, weeks, months and years, they have left offerings of sorts, shawls, colorful textiles, to serve as helpful barriers against the wind along the walls.</p><p>The chairs might be plastic, or old card table chairs, though not with sharp or rusted edges; it’s probably a mixture.</p><p>There might be some small rugs here and there for the older or the ones with problems or coming in with children in tow, to sit on during service/sermon; to gather on to listen to a slower song or melody.</p><p>There is an upraised stage… but not very high; you see this is not a big place and never will be because this is a place where people don’t disappear into a crowd. They can be private, and they can keep to themselves, but that is there choice; we don’t do mobs here. When it’s big enough to go bigger, we don’t hang on and control it; we send the new off like a little ship at sea… It becomes a tree; IT now then serves as a new oasis for those who will come to God.</p><p>The people there are every color, every educational background, though, frankly, most, not so much, because many educated people think they don’t need God or are too busy for God or …. whatever. There are ALL ages here. THERE are A LOT of older people here; very old. Not just 70’s or 80’s.</p><p>There are people here who are blind, lame, smelly, even stinky, corroding even… But most don’t stay that way.</p><p>There are a LOT of children here. They are allowed to sing and dance and they often lay hands on people, even the very very very young… two year olds… three year olds…. laying hands on the deaf, and they hear; people with MS get healed; odd broken bones straighten when the 10-year old boy lays his hand on them.</p><p>There is a minister and his wife, or a minister and her husband; they didn’t think they would stay here for long. They thought they were just sent for a “season,” but it’s now been 30 years, and they don’t call the place they came from “home,” anymore, for this has become their home.</p><p>They build houses for people with nothing; they move God’s hand to bring in doctors to people who cannot afford them; they believe in the abandoned, the wretchedly treated, the foul-looking ones, the ones with firey anger in their eyes and a sour look on their faces. They don’t give up on thieves, lepers, polio victims. They’ve seen the miracle working power of God over and over and over and over again. They’ve been at their wits’ end time and time again where God was merciful to them, brought them sustenance, encouragement, education, training, help, means, transport, healing, protection, promotion, enhancement.</p><p>They know a God who always knows where they are and how they are and they know a Father who never forgets them and always enjoys being with them; they know a friend named Jesus who is SO HAPPY to be with them. He is among FRIENDS when he is with them. They delight God, and he abides in them, bringing unquenchable hopefulness, birthing unstoppable determination, seeding a multitude of spiritual crops in them all the while watching his friends follow in his footsteps.</p><p>This is my ideal church, it is filled with God, not things. It is filled, once rectified to God and reconciled to love, and on the right path, with people who are filled with love for all. It does not covet, IT does not kill, IT does not betray, lie, steal; IT stands, rejoices, persists, gives, stretches out, receives, returns, sows and reaps all according to his auspicious will which never leads them astray</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Customers are the lifeblood of every business. Whether you’re a small startup that’s just beginning to gain some traction or a large corporation with years of marketing experience, you’re chasing customers that want to spend their money on whatever product or service you offer. Now, you’ve probably heard the term “target market” more times than you can stomach, and more than likely have a solid idea of the kinds of customers you’re after, but, in this article, we’re going to take a deep dive into exactly who the ideal customers of your business are so you can find them and build strong relationships them.</p><p></p><p>At its most basic definition, the goal of your business is to offer customers a product or service that makes them happy and solves their problems. What makes ideal customers different from others is the amount of time, effort, and resources you have to expend to acquire them and make them feel good about buying from your brand. In other words, ideal customers are easy to attract, take minimal effort to keep, and naturally become loyal, recurrent buyers. This is by no means the “golden ticket” that will allow you to set your marketing strategies on autopilot and kick your feet up, but ideal customers will give you a better return for the amount of effort (and money) you put into them. The premise behind these types of buyers finding the right chemistry between customer and business that fosters a mutually beneficial relationship.</p><p></p><p>They Happily Pay For What You Offer</p><p>While it’s natural to want every potential customer that checks out your brand to open their wallet and buy what you have to offer, not everyone is going to be happy with it. Almost without fail, you’re going to have the customers that take months, if not years of convincing before they painstakingly hand over their money (have a hard time seeing the value). By that same token, you’ll have the customers that are eager to jump on board and dive in head first (fully see the value), also known as ideal customers. You want the customers that are happy to pay for your product or service.</p><br />

                        AnswerIf your colleagues had an opportunity to tell us your primary strength what would that be? Your primary weakness what would that be?<p>Here's how to answer this question</p><p>The strength, in context, refers to what your friends think your good at. Notice that the question points to your 'colleagues' or 'friend' telling what your strength is, instead of yourself. An example, your friends feel confident when you do pep-talk with them. Then, encouraging people is your strength.</p><p>The weakness here refers to where a person(you) is having difficulties. For example, you are good at cleaning the house but bad at cooking. Another example can be observed in language. For you, "He's heavier than I am." is easier to process in the brain than "He weighs more than I do." Although the two literally mean the same.</p>What do you do when others resist of reject your ideas or actions?<p>You deliberate your idea, not your pride. Meaning, you prepare a solution for possible problems of your idea. And most importantly don't raise your voice</p><strong>Proverbs 15:1,</strong> A gentle answer turns away wrath, but a harsh word stirs up anger.<strong>What is your interpretation of "success?"</strong><p>For me, success is reaching your main goal without compromising moral or ethical principles, especially other people.</p>Suppose you are in a situation where deadlines and priorities change frequently and rapidly. How would you handle it?<p>Don't waste time, focus on accomplishing any given task.</p><strong>Proverbs 10:4</strong>, Lazy hands make for poverty, but diligent hands bring wealth.Tell me about a time when you were a part of a great team. What was your part in the success of your team?<p><strong>Safe answer: </strong>Listened to our leader and worked according to the assigned task.
