I haven't been to Bali Indonesia, but I have read about it. I havebeen to Boracay island, that's why I know these two touristdestination are similar in many ways. Both are small islands. Bali and Boracay boast of international cuisine because people from all over the world visit them. Bali beaches are golden while those of Boracay are white and the sand is fine as the powder. _____________2. The lack of rain has horrible effects on farmers. With no rain, their land dries up, and it is very difficult to grow anything. When thecrops fall, the farmers have no choice but to get a second job in order to make the money they need. Farming is a full-time job. Many farmers end up selling their land. Some farmers have accepted the government program, The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP). ___________________3. The school today and in the past are similar in a few ways and different in some aspects. Both have a learning room, a teacher and books. However, the classrooms in the past are considered concrete structures where learning should take place. On the other hand, the classrooms today utilize technology like LCD projectors, laptops, and other gadgets. Another is that lessonplans in the past were from printed materials while lessons of today are from books and other online platforms. No matter how alike and different the schools in the past and today are, what matters most is how effective learning takes place. __________________4. Boiling is perhaps the safest way to purify cloudy water. You will need a boiling pot, fire, salt, coffee filter or cloth, charcoal and cotton. First, pre-filter the cloudy water with a cotton filter or folded cloth. Then, boil the filtered water. Add a small amount of salt to improve the taste of the water as it is boiling. Next, let thewater cool. Meanwhile, make a cotton and charcoal filter bycrushing the charcoal and putting it in the cotton as the trap. Thiswill remove impurities and still some bad taste from the boiledwater. Finally, filter the boiled water through the cottontrap.________________5.

                                            II, IDENTIFICATION. Directions: Identify Pautasso's suggested ten rules in writing a literature review: Write the answer on the space provided before the number. a 1. The topic must be a well-defined topic that is interesting to you and your readers. 2. Reading other literature reviews from other papers may give you other literature to read and gain information from. 3. It is recommended that you read articles first before starting your literature review so that you could make sense of what the literature says of your chosen topic. This helps you organize the ideas you have read and helps you avoid irrelevant and confusing statements. 4. This has been covered in the previous modules. Choosing the kind of literature review you wish to write will help you structure your sentences and ideas into one coherent form. -5. While you are making the literature review to find answers to your chosen topic or research problem, you can also discuss similar or related issues through it. 6. It is not enough that you summarize the literature you read, try to understand how it differs from the setting and background of the study you are pursuing. Take note of what it lacked or the aspects which can be improved through your own study. 7. In order for a literature review to make sense, it must follow not only a chronological progression of ideas but also of a logical progression. Discuss the problem from its probable causes, continuing on to the current understanding and present solutions for it. After that, you can present your view or proposed solution. _8. Try having a fellow student read your literature review and see if it makes sense to him or her. The reader can point out places where the review has become confusing and thus needs improvement. 9. If you have made research at the same field before, you can cite your own work. However, be careful not to place too much emphasis on your previous research make it seem as it is more important than other sources that you collected. 10. Older studies give a perspective on the problem during a different tim setting.

I haven't been to Bali Indonesia, but I have read about it. I havebeen to Boracay island, that's why I know these two touristdestination are similar in many ways. Both are small islands. Bali and Boracay boast of international cuisine because people from all over the world visit them. Bali beaches are golden while those of Boracay are white and the sand is fine as the powder. _____________2. The lack of rain has horrible effects on farmers. With no rain, their land dries up, and it is very difficult to grow anything. When thecrops fall, the farmers have no choice but to get a second job in order to make the money they need. Farming is a full-time job. Many farmers end up selling their land. Some farmers have accepted the government program, The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP). ___________________3. The school today and in the past are similar in a few ways and different in some aspects. Both have a learning room, a teacher and books. However, the classrooms in the past are considered concrete structures where learning should take place. On the other hand, the classrooms today utilize technology like LCD projectors, laptops, and other gadgets. Another is that lessonplans in the past were from printed materials while lessons of today are from books and other online platforms. No matter how alike and different the schools in the past and today are, what matters most is how effective learning takes place. __________________4. Boiling is perhaps the safest way to purify cloudy water. You will need a boiling pot, fire, salt, coffee filter or cloth, charcoal and cotton. First, pre-filter the cloudy water with a cotton filter or folded cloth. Then, boil the filtered water. Add a small amount of salt to improve the taste of the water as it is boiling. Next, let thewater cool. Meanwhile, make a cotton and charcoal filter bycrushing the charcoal and putting it in the cotton as the trap. Thiswill remove impurities and still some bad taste from the boiledwater. Finally, filter the boiled water through the cottontrap.________________5. More and more children in the neighborhood were becomingsick of respiratory diseases, so the barangay officials planned outsome action. The entry of vehicles was limited, so the fumesexhausted would be lessened. Since smoking cigarettes harmsthe health of children, smokers in families were advised not to.The people were encouraged to plant more trees and otherplants in their yards in order that air around would be clearer.______________​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Fossils are a window into the past. They provide clear evidence that evolution has occurred. Scientists who find and study fossils are called paleontologists. How do they use fossils to understand the past? Consider the example of the horse, outlined in figure  9.3.2 . Fossils spanning a period of more than 50 million years show how the horse evolved.</p><p></p><p>The oldest horse fossils show what the earliest horses were like. They were only 0.4 m tall, or about the size of a fox, and they had four long toes. Other evidence shows they lived in wooded marshlands, where they probably ate soft leaves. Over time, the climate became drier, and grasslands slowly replaced the marshes. Later fossils show that horses changed as well.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>pa brainlest Po plssssss </p><br />
