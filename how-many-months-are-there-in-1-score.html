PLEASEEE HELP MEH GUYS. SHOW SOLUTION STEP BY STEP. THANKYOUUUUUU ;* </h2><br />
                        No. 1 A clock at strikes at every line, and there are 60 minutes every hour as to 60 lines. There are 24 hours each day. So 24•60=1440. A clock strikes 1440 times a day, and 1440•7=10080. So a clock strikes 10080 times a week.<br /><br />No.2 Luis will pass after his fourth test. If his score in the first test is 68 and will become 6 points better, then his succeeding scores will be: 1st test-68; 2nd test- 74; 3rd test-80; 4th test 86. The total of these scores multiplied by four is 77. So his average is 77.<br /><br />I can't quite understand number three so I'll skip to number four.<br /><br />No.4 A plumber works for 6 days with a salary of Php200.00 on the first day and doubled each day. So his salary will be: 1st day-200; 2nd day-400; 3rd day-800; 4th day-1600; 5th day-3200; 6th day-6400. So the answer is Php6400.00<br /><br />No.5 In every row, 6 cans is deducted. 1st row-80; 2nd row-74; 3rd row-68; 4th row-62; 5th row-56; 6th row-50; 7th row-44; 8th row-38; 9th row-32. The answer is 32.<br /><br />I hope my answer is helpful<br />P.S. Sorry I am unable to answer number 3. I think you should fix your grammar. Thank you.<br />
