Dear Jane,
I was delighted to read you're letter last week. Its always a pleasure to recieve the latest news and to here that you and your family had a great summer.
We spent last week at the beach and had so much fun on the sand and in the water exploring the coast we weren't prepared for the rains that came at the end of the vacation. The best parts of the trip was the opportunities to sightsee and relax.
My kids are back in school to. I find their are less things to worry about now that the kids are at school all day. There is plenty of fun things to do in the summer, but by August, I've running out of ideas. I've excepted the fact that we'll have to think up brand-new activities next summer; hoping to round up some creative ideas soon.
Thanks again for your letter!
Sincerely,
Karen</a>

And that made me want to die
The idea you had of me, who was she?
A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
Not weeping in a party bathroom
Some actress asking me what happened, you
That's what happened, you
You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes
Sipping coffee like you're on a late-night show
But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willing you to come
And he said, "It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one"</a>

Dear Jane,
I was delighted to read you're letter last week. Its always a pleasure to recieve the latest news and to here that you and your family had a great summer.
We spent last week at the beach and had so much fun on the sand and in the water exploring the coast we weren't prepared for the rains that came at the end of the vacation. The best parts of the trip was the opportunities to sightsee and relax.
My kids are back in school to. I find their are less things to worry about now that the kids are at school all day. There is plenty of fun things to do in the summer, but by August, I've running out of ideas. I've excepted the fact that we'll have to think up brand-new activities next summer; hoping to round up some creative ideas soon.
Thanks again for your letter!
Sincerely,
Karen</h2><br />

And that made me want to die
The idea you had of me, who was she?
A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
Not weeping in a party bathroom
Some actress asking me what happened, you
That's what happened, you
You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes
Sipping coffee like you're on a late-night show
But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willing you to come
And he said, "It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one"</h2><br />

Process Questions: - What idea do the underlined words suggest? In the first stanza, what is common between the pairs of words: bees - flowers; 5​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>When I wrote the following pages, or rather the bulk of them, I lived
</p><p>alone, in the woods, a mile from any neighbor, in a house which I had
</p><p>built myself, on the shore of Walden Pond, in Concord, Massachusetts,
</p><p>and earned my living by the labor of my hands only. I lived there two
</p><p>years and two months. At present I am a sojourner in civilized life
</p><p>again.
</p><p>
</p><p>I should not obtrude my affairs so much on the notice of my readers if
</p><p>very particular inquiries had not been made by my townsmen concerning
</p><p>my mode of life, which some would call impertinent, though they do not
</p><p>appear to me at all impertinent, but, considering the circumstances,
</p><p>very natural and pertinent. Some have asked what I got to eat; if I did
</p><p>not feel lonesome; if I was not afraid; and the like. Others have been
</p><p>curious to learn what portion of my income I devoted to charitable
</p><p>purposes; and some, who have large families, how many poor children
</p><p>I maintained. I will therefore ask those of my readers who feel no
</p><p>particular interest in me to pardon me if I undertake to answer some of
</p><p>these questions in this book. In most books, the _I_, or first person, is
</p><p>omitted; in this it will be retained; that, in respect to egotism, is
</p><p>the main difference. We commonly do not remember that it is, after all,
</p><p>always the first person that is speaking. I should not talk so
</p><p>much about myself if there were anybody else whom I knew as well.
</p><p>Unfortunately, I am confined to this theme by the narrowness of my
</p><p>experience. Moreover, I, on my side, require of every writer, first or
</p><p>last, a simple and sincere account of his own life, and not merely what
</p><p>he has heard of other men's lives; some such account as he would send to
</p><p>his kindred from a distant land; for if he has lived sincerely, it
</p><p>must have been in a distant land to me. Perhaps these pages are more
</p><p>particularly addressed to poor students. As for the rest of my readers,
</p><p>they will accept such portions as apply to them. I trust that none will
</p><p>stretch the seams in putting on the coat, for it may do good service to
</p><p>him whom it fits.
</p><p>
