                                            Directions: The election does not contain a topic sentence; hence you need to understand the selection to infer its main idea. What can a hug do? It delights. It comforts. It thrills. Who doesn't want a warmth of a loving hug? Just like words, hugs speak volumes. They can mean "I miss you," "Bye," "I care," "1 love you." "It's OK," "I forgive," "I'm so proud of you!" In victory celebrations, in trying times, or in hours of bereavement, kiss is not the need of the hour. It is the hug that matters most.. A hug costs nothing. But it is a great gift to give on any occasion. No need to shop for it or bother about size or length or width. All you need is to open your arms wide and wrap the person inside them. And no matter how long or how short your arms are, hugs are always a perfect fit. And what so nice about giving a hug? You can get one in return. A hug goes beyond physical contact. It encompasses compassion, love, forgiveness, and care. "A hug delights and warms, and charms that must be why God gave us arms," so goes the quotation. So with arms wide open, why not go out and hug someone today? But first, here's my big, big, hug.

                                            7.Moderator: why are the polocies of bullying not working? a) Panel: Physical bullying is when bullies hurt their targets physically. This mightbe shoving, tripping, punching, or hitting.b) Panel: I think the problem that it's not working as no one wants to enforce therules. No one wants to take the time, the effort. And, when they do the time,effort and punishment isn't fitting the crime. It's picking-up trash or staying afterschool.c) Panel: Some bullies don't understand normal social emotions like guilt,empathy, compassion, or remorse. These people need help from a mentalhealth professional like a counselor, social worker, psychiatrist, or psychologist.d) Panel: If you've been bullied with rumors or gossip, tell your friends so that theycan help you feel safe and secure. Avoid being alone, especially when thebullying is happening a lot.8. Moderator: Why do we feel the need to judge other people?a) Panel: I deeply believe that people bully people because they're bored. Theyhave nothing better to do because if you have something better to do like youhad to go somewhere, you wouldn't take the time to sit there and make fun ofsomebody.b) Panel: Join your school's bullying or violence prevention programs. Peermediation is another way you may be able to work things out with a bully. Ifyour school doesn't have these programs, start one of your own.c) Panel: Try talking to a trusted adult to talk about why you have become a bully.Ask them for some advice on how you could change.d) Panel: You're more likely to be hurt and get into trouble if you try to fight a bully.Work out your anger in another way, such as exercising or writing it down.​</a>

                            10. Directions: The election does not contain a topic sentence; hence you need to understand the selection to infer its main idea. What can a hug do? It delights. It comforts. It thrills. Who doesn't want a warmth of a loving hug? Just like words, hugs speak volumes. They can mean "I miss you," "Bye," "I care," "1 love you." "It's OK," "I forgive," "I'm so proud of you!" In victory celebrations, in trying times, or in hours of bereavement, kiss is not the need of the hour. It is the hug that matters most.. A hug costs nothing. But it is a great gift to give on any occasion. No need to shop for it or bother about size or length or width. All you need is to open your arms wide and wrap the person inside them. And no matter how long or how short your arms are, hugs are always a perfect fit. And what so nice about giving a hug? You can get one in return. A hug goes beyond physical contact. It encompasses compassion, love, forgiveness, and care. "A hug delights and warms, and charms that must be why God gave us arms," so goes the quotation. So with arms wide open, why not go out and hug someone today? But first, here's my big, big, hug.

                            18. 7.Moderator: why are the polocies of bullying not working? a) Panel: Physical bullying is when bullies hurt their targets physically. This mightbe shoving, tripping, punching, or hitting.b) Panel: I think the problem that it's not working as no one wants to enforce therules. No one wants to take the time, the effort. And, when they do the time,effort and punishment isn't fitting the crime. It's picking-up trash or staying afterschool.c) Panel: Some bullies don't understand normal social emotions like guilt,empathy, compassion, or remorse. These people need help from a mentalhealth professional like a counselor, social worker, psychiatrist, or psychologist.d) Panel: If you've been bullied with rumors or gossip, tell your friends so that theycan help you feel safe and secure. Avoid being alone, especially when thebullying is happening a lot.8. Moderator: Why do we feel the need to judge other people?a) Panel: I deeply believe that people bully people because they're bored. Theyhave nothing better to do because if you have something better to do like youhad to go somewhere, you wouldn't take the time to sit there and make fun ofsomebody.b) Panel: Join your school's bullying or violence prevention programs. Peermediation is another way you may be able to work things out with a bully. Ifyour school doesn't have these programs, start one of your own.c) Panel: Try talking to a trusted adult to talk about why you have become a bully.Ask them for some advice on how you could change.d) Panel: You're more likely to be hurt and get into trouble if you try to fight a bully.Work out your anger in another way, such as exercising or writing it down.​</h2><br />
