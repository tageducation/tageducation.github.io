Direction : Arrange the instructions on how to use and adjust a microscope in proper order Write A-H1. Rotate the nosepiece so that the objective lens with the lowest level of magnification is directly above the sample Reminder: Using lower magnifications first helps to select the part of the specimen of interest and then adjust further 2. Turn on the illuminator. When using the dimmer, it is best slowly increase the light intensity as the lamp heats up quite quickly 3. Tum the fine adjustment knob until the specimen comes into sharp focus. Caution should not take a long time to find focus, otherwise the high magnification objective could also hit the slide if you are having a difficult time to find focus then restart with the lower magnification objective. 4. Ensure the iris diaphragm is completely open, allowing the maximum amount of light to reach the slide and the lenses. Caution: Do not use the ins diaphragm to control the light, it is to control resolution and contrast - use the dimmer instead 5. Rotate the nosepiece so that the objective lens with the lowest level of magnification is directly above the sample. Reminder. Using lower magnifications first helps to select the part of the specimen of interest and then adjust Further 6. Place a slide or specimen on the stage with the sample directly above the aperture and, if possible, fasten it to the stage with the stage clips Reminder: A cover slip is always needed to allow for the best quality image. 7. The viewer should then be able rotate the nosepiece to higher settings and bring the sample into more and more detail with a minimal amount of refocusing 8. Tum the coarse adjustment knob until the specimen comes into broad focus. Caution: you should not use the coarse focus with a high magnification objective for fear of the objective making contact with the slide arter and week​</a>

a. Utilitarianism
b. Natural Ethics
c. Instrumental Approach
d. Virtue Ethics Perspective

b. Yes, because in the end a lot of people can benefit from these infrastructures in one way or another.
c. No, but if they only choose small portion of land to build the infrastructures then it is just reasonable and fine.
d. No, because in the long run, most of us will suffer from the consequences of our actions as human beings continuously prioritizing development over the environment.
38. Human beings are considered as the summit of creation that grants us the freedom and full authority to control the His creation thus, we are permitted to use the environment by any means possible. Is this statement always, correct? *
a. No, because our control and authority are only limited to the non-human beings and not directly to the environment itself.
b. Yes, the Divine Creator has granted us this power of free will and reason and it is up to us as to how we make use of His Creation by any means possible.
c. Yes, because we are created by His image and likeness, and we are tasked to rule over His creation. Thus, we are allowed to do anything we want to the environment and even to the non-human beings.
d. No, because as stewards of God, though we have the freedom and authority to control over His creation, we are always reminded about our moral responsibility to take care, protect, and respect the environment and not to use it for own expense.
39. There is an ongoing project on your Barangay yet, you overheard what this project is all about and has the potential to harm the environment. As a SK councilor, what will you do? *

d. Talk with the Brgy. Captain and ask the nature of the project. If what he heard was right, you and the other SK Councilors must come up with a proposed project proposal, that would aim not just for development but also to live sustainably.
40. The following situations shows prudence towards the environment, EXCEPT one. *
a. Mika is milk tea lover so she always buys it every other day. She realized that she always consumes plastic from its container down to the straw, that’s why she decided to bring her own container and metal straw next time.
b. Cindy is a real estate developer. In order to make more profits, she usually goes to vacant lands and mountainous areas that no one seems to own and cut down the trees endlessly to build some homes and other infrastructures to generate more income.
c. Andrew buys his conditioner and shampoo in a sari-sari store nearby. Eventually, he realized that a lot of plastics have been used because of its container, that’s why he decided to go instead to the supermarket every month and buy shampoo, conditioner, and other stuff in bulks.
d. Hannah is the town mayor of one of the cities in Cebu. She noticed that it became hotter in the surrounding areas, and the pollution worsens, when they started building the expressway above the river. Because of that, although it benefitted a lot of people from the past years, she decided to tear it down and restore the river again and decided to make it as a green space instead.</a>

                                            Read the paragraph below and answer the questions that follow.
The western world is in love with the concept of freedom. It is the most precious aspect of society. Whether it is the freedom of religion or speech, the freedom to choose our political leaders, or to pursue the life we choose without fear of interference from individuals or governments, freedom is essential and paramount in all things.
However, when we move from our societal craving for freedom to our personal lives, or the workplace, we seem ready to give up our freedom and are willing to put our happiness and our level of motivation in the hands of someone else. In the workplace we call this someone else "management". It becomes management's job to give us rewarding work, to motivate us, to make us into high-performing individuals and teams. We tell ourselves that our mechanical systems of rewards and punishments, measurements, strategies, or command and control structures get the behaviors that we want from our organizations. In short, we create these devices to help eliminate the need for the exercise of free will.
Koestenbaum and Block suggest that this "escape from freedom," as Erich Fromm called it, is in large part due to the fact that "...with freedom comes accountability, and with accountability comes guilt, and with guilt comes anxiety.
But this creates an interesting paradox. By allowing others to choose I have made a choice. I have chosen to give others the power to choose for me, which in itself is an exercise of my free will. Therefore, I am still accountable, at least to myself, for the results of my decision.
Arguments are sure to be put forward showing how, at least in certain circumstances, I had no choice in the matter: "I hate this job, but if I don't come to work I will be fired. I have no choice but to come to work." Or, "The law says I have to pay my taxes. I have no choice. If I don't pay my taxes I will go to jail."
When these statements are examined more closely we see that there is an element of choice in each. I choose to continue to go work at a job that I hate because I am unwilling to deal with the consequences of walking away from the job. Instead of choosing to look for another job, I choose to continue working at the one I have. I am accountable for my choice to continue in an unpleasant job instead of changing my situation. I choose to pay my taxes because I am not willing to be accountable for the consequences related to not paying my taxes. Regardless of why I made the choice to pay my taxes, it is still my choice to make the payment.
We are not always in control of the alternatives among which we may choose. Having free will does not imply that life will always be perfect, or that the choice of another option would have provided us with great happiness. But through the exercise of our free will we are able to embrace our humanity, and to take on the succession of risks that life has to offer.
Recognizing that we are free gives us the ability to exercise control over our existence, and lets us shift from blaming others for how things are to being accountable for our life. "Once the
 inevitability [that we are accountable] is recognized, we will be inclined to place the full blame [or credit] on ourselves rather than on others or on objective situations beyond our control." (Freedom And Accountability At Work, Koestenbaum and Block, 2001, P. 79)
The good news is that you have free will, and that opens up a world of opportunity. The bad news is that you have free will, and that opens up a world of accountability.
1. How are Freedom and Accountability related to each other? Explain clearly and comprehensively.

                                            DIRECTIONS: Identify whether the statement is FOR OR AGAINST the presented issue. 1. In March, Malacañang said the government showed "excellent management of the COVID-19 pandemic, saying it has brought the crisis under control compared to richer countries. 2. A consultant to the government's task force had also said the Philippines was faring better han other countries in responding to the pandemic. The raging crisis has so far claimed over 13,800 lives in the Country. Total infections stood at more than 812,000, among the worsi in Southeast Asia. 3. It is a relief to see that Covid-19 cases in Davao City have steadily dropped in the past several weeks. This is thanks to the hard work of everyone involved in the management of the Covid-19 disease 4. Academic break is not only for the students, it is also for the faculty and staff who are mostly the heads of their families. We aren't even learning anymore; we are just trying to survive. 5. Academic break would allow students and faculty members to focus on "more pressing Dersonal concerns, such as taking care of close or distant family members greatly affected by the typhoons. leaning or rebuilding their homes, as well as maybe restart with their main or other sources of livelihood." 6. Filipinos will be in living heli if the ECQ gets extended. The sudden lockdown in itself is an added burden as millions have already lost their jobs in the middle of a worsening pandemic 7. Children deserve to grow up safe and healthy, regardless of their family's income. Cash benefits and other programmes make a difference and give children a chance at a happy, productive future 8. Seek a lifestyle that limits the large-scale consumption of energy (electricity, oil) for every person. Improve environmental education which makes this way of thinking known and send out information from the regions. 9. The pollution situation would become more and more severe, and we would not have clean water to drink. Neither food nor air would be safe. 10. Technology helps advance the human race forward and makes doing mundane things more efficient and repeatable. Technology has helped create the information revolution.Pasagot po ng maayos thank you in advance ​</a>

                                            Read here:::::::::::::::::::::::::BATS BY DEBBIE DEANIn the distant past, many people thought bats had magical powers, but times have changed. Today, many people believe that bats are rodents, that they cannot see, and that they are more likely than other animals to carry rabies. All of these beliefs are mistaken. Bats are not rodents, are not blind, and are no more likely than dogs and cats to transmit rabies. Bats, in fact, are among the least understood and least appreciated of animals. Bats are not rodents with wings, contrary to popular belief. Like all rodents, bats are mammals, but they have a skeleton similar to the human skeleton. The bones in bat wings are much like those in arms and the human hand, with a thumb and four fingers. In bats, the bones of the arms and the four fingers of the hands are very long. This bone structure helps support the web of skin that stretches fromthe body to the ends of the fingers to form wings. Although bats cannot see colors, they have good vision in both dim and bright light. Since most bats stay in darkness during the day and do their feeding at night, they do not use their vision to maneuver in the dark but use a process called echolocation. This process enables bats to emit sounds from their mouths that bounce off objects and allow them to avoid the objects when flying. They use this system to locate flying insects to feed on as well. Typically, insect-eating bats emerge at dusk and fly to streams or ponds where they feed. They catch the insects on their wingtip or tail membrane and fling them into their mouths while flying. There are about 1,000 species of bat, ranging in size from the bumblebee bat, which is about an inch long, to the flying fox, which is sixteen inches long and has a wingspan of five feet. Each type of bat has a specialized diet. For seventy percent of bats, the diet is insects. Other types of bats feed on flowers, pollen, nectar, and fruit or on small animals such as birds, mice, lizards, and frogs. One species of bat feeds on the blood of large mammals. This is the common vampire bat, which lives only in Latin America and is probably best known for feeding on the blood of cattle. Unfortunately, in an attempt to control vampire bat populations, farmers have unintentionally killed thousands of beneficial fruit-and insect-eating bats as well. Bats, in fact, perform a number of valuable functions. Their greatest economic value is in eliminating insect pests. Insect- eating bats can catch six hundred mosquitoes in an hour and eat half their body weight in insects every night. In many tropical rain forests, fruit eating bats are the main means of spreading the seeds of tropical fruits. Nectar-feeding bats pollinate a number of tropical plants. If it were not for bats, we might not have peaches, bananas, mangoes, guavas, figs, or dates.Today, the survival of many bat species is uncertain. Sixty percent of bats do not survive past infancy. Some are killed bypredators such as owls, hawks, snakes and other meat-eating creatures, but most are victims of pesticides and other human intrusions. In Carlsbad Caverns, New Mexico, where there were once eight million bats, there are now a quarter million. At Eagle Creek, Arizona, the bat population dropped from thirty million to thirty thousand in six years. Bats often have been burdened with a bad reputation, perhaps because they are not the warm, cuddly sort of animal we love to love. However, their unusual physical features should not lead us to overestimate their harm or to underestimate their value.1. What is the text about?2. Who is the author of the text?3.

Rotate the nosepiece so that the objective lens with the lowest level of magnification is directly above the sample Reminder: Using lower magnifications first helps to select the part of the specimen of interest and then adjust further 2. Turn on the illuminator. When using the dimmer, it is best slowly increase the light intensity as the lamp heats up quite quickly 3. Tum the fine adjustment knob until the specimen comes into sharp focus. Caution should not take a long time to find focus, otherwise the high magnification objective could also hit the slide if you are having a difficult time to find focus then restart with the lower magnification objective. 4. Ensure the iris diaphragm is completely open, allowing the maximum amount of light to reach the slide and the lenses. Caution: Do not use the ins diaphragm to control the light, it is to control resolution and contrast - use the dimmer instead 5. Rotate the nosepiece so that the objective lens with the lowest level of magnification is directly above the sample. Reminder. Using lower magnifications first helps to select the part of the specimen of interest and then adjust Further 6. Place a slide or specimen on the stage with the sample directly above the aperture and, if possible, fasten it to the stage with the stage clips Reminder: A cover slip is always needed to allow for the best quality image. 7. The viewer should then be able rotate the nosepiece to higher settings and bring the sample into more and more detail with a minimal amount of refocusing 8.

I-rotate ang nosepiece upang ang objective lens na may pinakamababang level ng magnification ay direktang nasa itaas ng sample. Kapag ginagamit ang dimmer, pinakamainam na dahan-dahang taasan ang intensity ng liwanag dahil medyo mabilis uminit ang lampara. Ang pag-iingat ay hindi dapat tumagal ng mahabang oras upang mahanap ang focus, kung hindi, ang mataas na layunin ng pag-magnify ay maaari ring tumama sa slide kung nahihirapan kang makahanap ng focus at pagkatapos ay i-restart gamit ang mas mababang layunin ng pag-magnify. 4. Tiyakin na ang iris diaphragm ay ganap na nakabukas, na nagbibigay-daan sa maximum na dami ng liwanag na maabot ang slide at ang mga lente. Pag-iingat: Huwag gamitin ang ins diaphragm para kontrolin ang liwanag, ito ay para kontrolin ang resolution at contrast - gamitin ang dimmer sa halip 5. I-rotate ang nosepiece upang ang objective lens na may pinakamababang antas ng magnification ay direktang nasa itaas ng sample. Paalala. Ang paggamit ng mas mababang mga magnification ay unang nakakatulong upang piliin ang bahagi ng specimen na interes at pagkatapos ay ayusin ang Karagdagang 6. Maglagay ng slide o ispesimen sa entablado na ang sample ay direkta sa itaas ng siwang at, kung maaari, i-fasten ito sa entablado gamit ang mga clip ng entablado. : Ang isang cover slip ay palaging kailangan upang bigyang-daan ang pinakamahusay na kalidad ng imahe. 7. Dapat na maiikot ng viewer ang nosepiece sa mas mataas na mga setting at dalhin ang sample sa higit at higit pang detalye na may kaunting halaga ng muling pagtutok. Mag-ingat: hindi mo dapat gamitin ang magaspang na pokus na may mataas na layunin sa pag-magnify dahil sa takot na ang layunin ay makipag-ugnayan sa slide arter at linggo​</p><p>

                            15. Read the paragraph below and answer the questions that follow.
The western world is in love with the concept of freedom. It is the most precious aspect of society. Whether it is the freedom of religion or speech, the freedom to choose our political leaders, or to pursue the life we choose without fear of interference from individuals or governments, freedom is essential and paramount in all things.
However, when we move from our societal craving for freedom to our personal lives, or the workplace, we seem ready to give up our freedom and are willing to put our happiness and our level of motivation in the hands of someone else. In the workplace we call this someone else "management". It becomes management's job to give us rewarding work, to motivate us, to make us into high-performing individuals and teams. We tell ourselves that our mechanical systems of rewards and punishments, measurements, strategies, or command and control structures get the behaviors that we want from our organizations. In short, we create these devices to help eliminate the need for the exercise of free will.
Koestenbaum and Block suggest that this "escape from freedom," as Erich Fromm called it, is in large part due to the fact that "...with freedom comes accountability, and with accountability comes guilt, and with guilt comes anxiety.
But this creates an interesting paradox. By allowing others to choose I have made a choice. I have chosen to give others the power to choose for me, which in itself is an exercise of my free will. Therefore, I am still accountable, at least to myself, for the results of my decision.
Arguments are sure to be put forward showing how, at least in certain circumstances, I had no choice in the matter: "I hate this job, but if I don't come to work I will be fired. I have no choice but to come to work." Or, "The law says I have to pay my taxes. I have no choice. If I don't pay my taxes I will go to jail."
When these statements are examined more closely we see that there is an element of choice in each. I choose to continue to go work at a job that I hate because I am unwilling to deal with the consequences of walking away from the job. Instead of choosing to look for another job, I choose to continue working at the one I have. I am accountable for my choice to continue in an unpleasant job instead of changing my situation. I choose to pay my taxes because I am not willing to be accountable for the consequences related to not paying my taxes. Regardless of why I made the choice to pay my taxes, it is still my choice to make the payment.
We are not always in control of the alternatives among which we may choose. Having free will does not imply that life will always be perfect, or that the choice of another option would have provided us with great happiness. But through the exercise of our free will we are able to embrace our humanity, and to take on the succession of risks that life has to offer.
Recognizing that we are free gives us the ability to exercise control over our existence, and lets us shift from blaming others for how things are to being accountable for our life. "Once the
 inevitability [that we are accountable] is recognized, we will be inclined to place the full blame [or credit] on ourselves rather than on others or on objective situations beyond our control." (Freedom And Accountability At Work, Koestenbaum and Block, 2001, P. 79)
The good news is that you have free will, and that opens up a world of opportunity. The bad news is that you have free will, and that opens up a world of accountability.
1. How are Freedom and Accountability related to each other? Explain clearly and comprehensively.

                            25. DIRECTIONS: Identify whether the statement is FOR OR AGAINST the presented issue. 1. In March, Malacañang said the government showed "excellent management of the COVID-19 pandemic, saying it has brought the crisis under control compared to richer countries. 2. A consultant to the government's task force had also said the Philippines was faring better han other countries in responding to the pandemic. The raging crisis has so far claimed over 13,800 lives in the Country. Total infections stood at more than 812,000, among the worsi in Southeast Asia. 3. It is a relief to see that Covid-19 cases in Davao City have steadily dropped in the past several weeks. This is thanks to the hard work of everyone involved in the management of the Covid-19 disease 4. Academic break is not only for the students, it is also for the faculty and staff who are mostly the heads of their families. We aren't even learning anymore; we are just trying to survive. 5. Academic break would allow students and faculty members to focus on "more pressing Dersonal concerns, such as taking care of close or distant family members greatly affected by the typhoons. leaning or rebuilding their homes, as well as maybe restart with their main or other sources of livelihood." 6. Filipinos will be in living heli if the ECQ gets extended. The sudden lockdown in itself is an added burden as millions have already lost their jobs in the middle of a worsening pandemic 7. Children deserve to grow up safe and healthy, regardless of their family's income. Cash benefits and other programmes make a difference and give children a chance at a happy, productive future 8. Seek a lifestyle that limits the large-scale consumption of energy (electricity, oil) for every person. Improve environmental education which makes this way of thinking known and send out information from the regions. 9. The pollution situation would become more and more severe, and we would not have clean water to drink. Neither food nor air would be safe. 10. Technology helps advance the human race forward and makes doing mundane things more efficient and repeatable. Technology has helped create the information revolution.Pasagot po ng maayos thank you in advance ​</h2><br />

                            26. Read here:::::::::::::::::::::::::BATS BY DEBBIE DEANIn the distant past, many people thought bats had magical powers, but times have changed. Today, many people believe that bats are rodents, that they cannot see, and that they are more likely than other animals to carry rabies. All of these beliefs are mistaken. Bats are not rodents, are not blind, and are no more likely than dogs and cats to transmit rabies. Bats, in fact, are among the least understood and least appreciated of animals. Bats are not rodents with wings, contrary to popular belief. Like all rodents, bats are mammals, but they have a skeleton similar to the human skeleton. The bones in bat wings are much like those in arms and the human hand, with a thumb and four fingers. In bats, the bones of the arms and the four fingers of the hands are very long. This bone structure helps support the web of skin that stretches fromthe body to the ends of the fingers to form wings. Although bats cannot see colors, they have good vision in both dim and bright light. Since most bats stay in darkness during the day and do their feeding at night, they do not use their vision to maneuver in the dark but use a process called echolocation. This process enables bats to emit sounds from their mouths that bounce off objects and allow them to avoid the objects when flying. They use this system to locate flying insects to feed on as well. Typically, insect-eating bats emerge at dusk and fly to streams or ponds where they feed. They catch the insects on their wingtip or tail membrane and fling them into their mouths while flying. There are about 1,000 species of bat, ranging in size from the bumblebee bat, which is about an inch long, to the flying fox, which is sixteen inches long and has a wingspan of five feet. Each type of bat has a specialized diet. For seventy percent of bats, the diet is insects. Other types of bats feed on flowers, pollen, nectar, and fruit or on small animals such as birds, mice, lizards, and frogs. One species of bat feeds on the blood of large mammals. This is the common vampire bat, which lives only in Latin America and is probably best known for feeding on the blood of cattle. Unfortunately, in an attempt to control vampire bat populations, farmers have unintentionally killed thousands of beneficial fruit-and insect-eating bats as well. Bats, in fact, perform a number of valuable functions. Their greatest economic value is in eliminating insect pests. Insect- eating bats can catch six hundred mosquitoes in an hour and eat half their body weight in insects every night. In many tropical rain forests, fruit eating bats are the main means of spreading the seeds of tropical fruits. Nectar-feeding bats pollinate a number of tropical plants. If it were not for bats, we might not have peaches, bananas, mangoes, guavas, figs, or dates.Today, the survival of many bat species is uncertain. Sixty percent of bats do not survive past infancy. Some are killed bypredators such as owls, hawks, snakes and other meat-eating creatures, but most are victims of pesticides and other human intrusions. In Carlsbad Caverns, New Mexico, where there were once eight million bats, there are now a quarter million. At Eagle Creek, Arizona, the bat population dropped from thirty million to thirty thousand in six years. Bats often have been burdened with a bad reputation, perhaps because they are not the warm, cuddly sort of animal we love to love. However, their unusual physical features should not lead us to overestimate their harm or to underestimate their value.1. What is the text about?2. Who is the author of the text?3.
