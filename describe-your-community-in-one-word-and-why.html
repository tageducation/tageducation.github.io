                                            Why resilience matters a lot in Disaster Preparedness (excerpt)  
Resilience has become a “hot word” recently to describe the ability of the Filipinos to immediately bounce back from hardships and devastating events, move on and rebuild easily. Others tagged “Filipino resiliency” as a romanticized trait that has been used to excuse the government’s shortcomings in handling and preparing for natural hazards.
However, from the perspective of disaster preparedness, resilience can be the people’s strongest trait. “Being resilient doesn’t mean ignoring the roots of vulnerabilities. It is the goal of resilience to improve disaster mitigation.” says Academician Alfredo Mahar Lagmay, NRCP Member of the NRCP Earth and Space Sciences Division, and Professor at the UP National Institute of Geological Studies. With the onslaught of the COVID pandemic and threats of climate change, communities will have to adapt even more to stressful environmental conditions, and investing on resilience is a foremost important measure. Lagmay pointed out that the government should focus on enhancing the resilience of its communities for better disaster planning and hazard management which would allow reducing the disaster impacts and losses. 
Resilience is defined as the ability to prepare and plan for, absorb, recover from, and more successfully adapt to adverse events. Disaster resilience is determined by the degree to which individuals, communities and public and private organizations are capable of organizing themselves to learn from past disasters and reduce their risks to future ones.
“Better anticipation of hazards and disasters could lead to better planning and enhanced resilience,” added Lagmay.

I will build another house for Madulimay."5."Lumnay," he said tenderly. "Lumnay, if I did this it is because of my need fora child. You know that life is not worth living without a child. The man has mocked me behind my back.You know that."6. What was it that made a man wish for a child? What was it in life, in the workin the field, in the planting and harvest, in the silence of the night, in the communing with husband andwife, in the whole life of the tribe itself that made man wish for the laughter and speech of a child? Supposehe changed his mind? Why did the unwritten law demand, anyway, that a man, to be a man, must have achild to come after him?7. Suddenly she found courage. She would go to the dance.

Let her be the first woman to complain, to denounce the unwritten rule that a man maytake another woman.8. She made for the other side of the village where the dancing was. There was aflaming glow over the whole place; a great bonfire was burning. The gangsas clamored more loudly now,and it seemed they were calling to her. She was near at last. She could see the dancers clearly now. Theman leaped lightly with their gangsas as they circled the dancing women decked in feast garments andbeads, tripping on the ground like graceful birds, following their men.9. The flames of the bonfire leaped in countless sparks which spread and roselike yellow points and died out in the night. The blaze reached out to her like a spreading radiance. Shedid not have the courage to break into the wedding feast.10. Lumnay thought of Awiyao as the Awiyao she had known long ago-- a strong,muscular boy carrying his heavy loads of fuel logs down the mountains to his home. She had met him oneday as she was on her way to fill her clay jars with water. He had stopped at the spring to drink and rest;and she had made him drink the cool mountain water from her coconut shell. After that it did not take himlong to decide to throw his spear on the stairs of her father's house in token on his desire to marry her.​</a>

                            9. Why resilience matters a lot in Disaster Preparedness (excerpt)  
Resilience has become a “hot word” recently to describe the ability of the Filipinos to immediately bounce back from hardships and devastating events, move on and rebuild easily. Others tagged “Filipino resiliency” as a romanticized trait that has been used to excuse the government’s shortcomings in handling and preparing for natural hazards.
However, from the perspective of disaster preparedness, resilience can be the people’s strongest trait. “Being resilient doesn’t mean ignoring the roots of vulnerabilities. It is the goal of resilience to improve disaster mitigation.” says Academician Alfredo Mahar Lagmay, NRCP Member of the NRCP Earth and Space Sciences Division, and Professor at the UP National Institute of Geological Studies. With the onslaught of the COVID pandemic and threats of climate change, communities will have to adapt even more to stressful environmental conditions, and investing on resilience is a foremost important measure. Lagmay pointed out that the government should focus on enhancing the resilience of its communities for better disaster planning and hazard management which would allow reducing the disaster impacts and losses. 
Resilience is defined as the ability to prepare and plan for, absorb, recover from, and more successfully adapt to adverse events. Disaster resilience is determined by the degree to which individuals, communities and public and private organizations are capable of organizing themselves to learn from past disasters and reduce their risks to future ones.
“Better anticipation of hazards and disasters could lead to better planning and enhanced resilience,” added Lagmay.

"It's only that a man must have a child.2. "I have prayed to Kabunyan much. I have sacrificed many chickens in myprayers."3. You remember how angry you were once when you came home from yourwork in the terrace because I butchered one of our pigs without your permission? I did it to appeaseKabunyan, because, like you, I wanted to have a child. But what could I do?"4."This house is yours," he said. "I built it for you. Make it your own, live in it aslong as you wish. I will build another house for Madulimay."5."Lumnay," he said tenderly. "Lumnay, if I did this it is because of my need fora child. You know that life is not worth living without a child. The man has mocked me behind my back.You know that."6. What was it that made a man wish for a child? What was it in life, in the workin the field, in the planting and harvest, in the silence of the night, in the communing with husband andwife, in the whole life of the tribe itself that made man wish for the laughter and speech of a child? Supposehe changed his mind? Why did the unwritten law demand, anyway, that a man, to be a man, must have achild to come after him?7. Suddenly she found courage. She would go to the dance. She would go to thechief of the village, to the elders, to tell them it was not right. Awiyao was hers; nobody could take himaway from her. Let her be the first woman to complain, to denounce the unwritten rule that a man maytake another woman.8. She made for the other side of the village where the dancing was. There was aflaming glow over the whole place; a great bonfire was burning. The gangsas clamored more loudly now,and it seemed they were calling to her. She was near at last. She could see the dancers clearly now. Theman leaped lightly with their gangsas as they circled the dancing women decked in feast garments andbeads, tripping on the ground like graceful birds, following their men.9. The flames of the bonfire leaped in countless sparks which spread and roselike yellow points and died out in the night. The blaze reached out to her like a spreading radiance. Shedid not have the courage to break into the wedding feast.10. Lumnay thought of Awiyao as the Awiyao she had known long ago-- a strong,muscular boy carrying his heavy loads of fuel logs down the mountains to his home. She had met him oneday as she was on her way to fill her clay jars with water. He had stopped at the spring to drink and rest;and she had made him drink the cool mountain water from her coconut shell.

"It's only that a man must have a child.2"I have prayed to Kabunyan much. I have sacrificed many chickens in mywork in the terrace because I butchered one of our pigs without your permission? I did it to appease3. You remember how angry you were once when you came home from yourKabunyan, because, like you, I wanted to have a child. But what could I do?"4. This house is yours," he said. "I built it for you. Make it your own live in it aslong as you wish. I will build another house for Madulimay."5. "Lumnay," he said tenderly. "Lumnay, if I did this it is because of my need fora child. You know that life is not worth living without a child. The man has mocked me behind my back.You know that."6. What was it that made a man wish for a child? What was it in life, in the workin the field, in the planting and harvest, in the silence of the night, in the communing with husband andwife, in the whole life of the tribe itself that made man wish for the laughter and speech of a child? Supposehe changed his mind? Why did the unwritten law demand, anyway, that a man, to be a man, must have achild to come after him?7. Suddenly she found courage. She would go to the dance. She would go to thechief of the village, to the elders, to tell them it was not right. Awiyao was hers; nobody could take himaway from her. Let her be the first woman to complain, to denounce the unwritten rule that a man maytake another woman.8. She made for the other side of the village where the dancing was. There was aflaming glow over the whole place; a great bonfire was burning. The gangsas clamored more loudly now,and it seemed they were calling to her. She was near at last. She could see the dancers clearly now. Theman leaped lightly with their gangsas as they circled the dancing women decked in feast garments andbeads, tripping on the ground like graceful birds, following their men.9. The flames of the bonfire leaped in countless sparks which spread and roselike yellow points and died out in the night. The blaze reached out to her like a spreading radiance. Shedid not have the courage to break into the wedding feast.10. Lumnay thought of Awiyao as the Awiyao she had known long ago-- a strong,muscular boy carrying his heavy loads of fuel logs down the mountains to his home. She had met him oneday as she was on her way to fill her clay jars with water. He had stopped at the spring to drink and rest;and she had made him drink the cool mountain water from her coconut shell. After that it did not take himlong to decide to throw his spear on the stairs of her father's house in token on his desire to marry her.pls...pa help po thank you...​</h2><br />
