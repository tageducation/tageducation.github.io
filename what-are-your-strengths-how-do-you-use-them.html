                                            Give an example of a quote: Any quote is accepted except for rude ones.
Mine: "Sometimes you say that you are never wrong, but in reality, you are also never perfect, so don't hold something you know against another you never knew."
My 2nd Example: "Life is somehow pretty tough, but you know what keeps you stronger? the way you cry is how you show your pain to others, and if others think you are weak, they are too blind to see the closeness of your strength because crying doesn't make you weak, you've just stayed strong for a particular time, and you can continue to do all this for as much as long you can hold it for, so there's no need to compliment yourself inadequately, we are all equal and we're just humans, but there is a difference between us, it's about the habits we have and what we wave for when we want to show a different path between sins and forgiveness..."
My 3rd Example: "Sometimes words may hurt others, but don't let them hurt you, you should be the one giving them hope, the time you realize it's you making them experience to not give up."
My 4th Example: "Knowing is meticulous, but experiencing is even more considerable, it makes you realize perpetually."
My 5th Example: "Every story has to give the main character a problem to face and solve it. If he or she can't solve it, then there's no point in making a chronicle, if the story keeps going on without an end, then you're making a whole life history, there's no other way to keep going on, it's just between life and death."

                                            SUMMARIZESo how do you go about identifying your strengths and weaknesses, and analyzing the opportunities and threats that flow from them? SWOT Analysis is a useful technique that helps you to do this. What makes SWOT especially powerful is that, with a little thought, it can help you to uncover opportunities that you would not otherwise have spotted. And by understanding your weaknesses, you can manage and eliminate threats that might otherwise hurt your ability to move forward in your role. If you look at yourself using the SWOT framework, you can start to separate yourself from your peers, and further develop the specialized talents and abilities that you need in order to advance your career and to help you achieve your personal goals.​</a>

                                            "Are You A Carrot, Egg or Coffee Bean?" A young woman went to her mother and told her about her life and how things were so hard for her. She did not know how she was going to make it and wanted to give up. She was tired of fighting and struggling. It seemed as one problem was solved a new one arose. Her mother took her to the kitchen. She filled three pots with water. In the first, she placed carrots, in the second she placed eggs, and the last she placed ground coffee beans. She let them sit and boil without saying a word. In about twenty minute she turned off the burners. She fished the carrots out and placed them in a bowl. She pulled the eggs out and placed them in a bowl. Then she ladled the coffee into a bowl. Turning to her daughter, she asked, "Tell me what you see?" "Carrots, eggs, and coffee," she replied. She brought her closer and asked her to feel the carrots. She did and noted that they were soft. She then asked her to take an egg and break it. After pulling off the shell, she observed the hard-boiled egg. Finally, she asked her to sip the coffee. The daughter smiled, as she tasted its rich aroma. The daughter then asked, "What's the point, mother?" Her mother explained that each of these objects had faced the same adversity... boiling water - but each reacted differently. The carrot went in strong, hard, and unrelenting. However, after being subjected to the boiling water, it softened and became weak. The egg had been fragile. Its thin outer shell had protected its liquid interior. But, after being through the boiling water, its inside became hardened. The ground coffee beans were unique, however. After they were in the boiling water they had changed the water. "Which are you?" she asked the daughter. "When adversity knocks on your door, how do you respond? Are you a carrot, an egg, or a coffee bean?" Think of this: Which am I? Am I the carrot that seems strong, but with pain and adversity, do I wilt and become soft and lose my strength? Am I the egg that starts with a malleable heart, but changes with the heat? Did I have a fluid spirit, but after death, a break up, a financial hardship, or some other trial, have I become hardened and stiff? Does my shell look the same, but on the inside am I bitter and tough with a stiff spirit and a hardened heart? Or am I like the coffee bean? The bean actually changes the hot water, the very circumstance that brings the pain. When the water gets hot, it releases the fragrance and flavor. If you are like the bean, when things are at their worst, you get better and change the situation around you. When the hours are the darkest and trials are their greatest do you elevate to another level? How do you handle adversity? ARE YOU A CARROT, AN EGG, OR A COFFEE BEAN?make an essay using this guide questions:1. what is the story about?2. what message does it convey?3. as a family how can you apply the lessons you learned from the story?​</a>

Summarize the paragraphs below: So how do you go about identifying your strengths and weaknesses, and analyzing the opportunities and threats that flow from them? SWOT Analysis is a useful technique that helps you to do this. What makes SWOT especially powerful is that, with a little thought, it can help you to uncover opportunities that you would not otherwise have spotted. And by understanding your weaknesses, you can manage and eliminate threats that might otherwise hurt your ability to move forward in your role. If you look at yourself using the SWOT framework, you can start to separate yourself from your peers, and further develop the specialized talents and abilities that you need in order to advance your career and to help you achieve your personal goals.wrong answer report​</a>

                            7. Give an example of a quote: Any quote is accepted except for rude ones.
Mine: "Sometimes you say that you are never wrong, but in reality, you are also never perfect, so don't hold something you know against another you never knew."
My 2nd Example: "Life is somehow pretty tough, but you know what keeps you stronger? the way you cry is how you show your pain to others, and if others think you are weak, they are too blind to see the closeness of your strength because crying doesn't make you weak, you've just stayed strong for a particular time, and you can continue to do all this for as much as long you can hold it for, so there's no need to compliment yourself inadequately, we are all equal and we're just humans, but there is a difference between us, it's about the habits we have and what we wave for when we want to show a different path between sins and forgiveness..."
My 3rd Example: "Sometimes words may hurt others, but don't let them hurt you, you should be the one giving them hope, the time you realize it's you making them experience to not give up."
My 4th Example: "Knowing is meticulous, but experiencing is even more considerable, it makes you realize perpetually."
My 5th Example: "Every story has to give the main character a problem to face and solve it. If he or she can't solve it, then there's no point in making a chronicle, if the story keeps going on without an end, then you're making a whole life history, there's no other way to keep going on, it's just between life and death."

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. The most effective technique in solving problems using creative problem solving techniques can vary depending on the nature of the problem and the individual's preferred problem-solving style. However, one technique that is often effective is the use of a structured problem-solving process, such as the "SCAMPER" technique.</p><p></p><p>SCAMPER is a mnemonic that stands for a series of questions that can help generate new ideas for solving a problem. These questions prompt the problem-solver to consider different perspectives and approaches to the problem, encouraging them to think creatively and outside the box.</p><p></p><p>One reason why the SCAMPER technique is effective is that it provides a structured approach to problem-solving, breaking down the problem into smaller parts and guiding the problem-solver through a series of questions that encourage them to think creatively. This structure helps to ensure that the problem-solver considers a variety of potential solutions, and reduces the likelihood that they will get stuck in a rut or miss important insights.</p><p></p><p>Another reason why the SCAMPER technique is effective is that it encourages the problem-solver to look at the problem from different angles and to think about the problem in new ways. By asking questions such as "What if you combined this with that?" and "What would happen if you used it for the opposite purpose?", the SCAMPER technique helps to spark new ideas and approaches to the problem.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the SCAMPER technique is one of the most effective strategies in solving problems using creative problem solving techniques, as it provides a structured approach to problem-solving that encourages creative thinking and generates a variety of potential solutions.</p><p></p><p></p><p>2. </p><br />

SWOT Analysis is a useful technique that helps you to do this. What makes SWOT especially powerful is that, with a little thought, it can help you to uncover opportunities that you would not otherwise have spotted. And by understanding your weaknesses, you can manage and eliminate threats that might otherwise hurt your ability to move forward in your role. If you look at yourself using the SWOT framework, you can start to separate yourself from your peers, and further develop the specialized talents and abilities that you need in order to advance your career and to help you achieve your personal goals.​</h2><br />

                            11. "Are You A Carrot, Egg or Coffee Bean?" A young woman went to her mother and told her about her life and how things were so hard for her. She did not know how she was going to make it and wanted to give up. She was tired of fighting and struggling. It seemed as one problem was solved a new one arose. Her mother took her to the kitchen. She filled three pots with water. In the first, she placed carrots, in the second she placed eggs, and the last she placed ground coffee beans. She let them sit and boil without saying a word. In about twenty minute she turned off the burners. She fished the carrots out and placed them in a bowl. She pulled the eggs out and placed them in a bowl. Then she ladled the coffee into a bowl. Turning to her daughter, she asked, "Tell me what you see?" "Carrots, eggs, and coffee," she replied. She brought her closer and asked her to feel the carrots. She did and noted that they were soft. She then asked her to take an egg and break it. After pulling off the shell, she observed the hard-boiled egg. Finally, she asked her to sip the coffee. The daughter smiled, as she tasted its rich aroma. The daughter then asked, "What's the point, mother?" Her mother explained that each of these objects had faced the same adversity... boiling water - but each reacted differently. The carrot went in strong, hard, and unrelenting. However, after being subjected to the boiling water, it softened and became weak. The egg had been fragile. Its thin outer shell had protected its liquid interior. But, after being through the boiling water, its inside became hardened. The ground coffee beans were unique, however. After they were in the boiling water they had changed the water. "Which are you?" she asked the daughter. "When adversity knocks on your door, how do you respond? Are you a carrot, an egg, or a coffee bean?" Think of this: Which am I? Am I the carrot that seems strong, but with pain and adversity, do I wilt and become soft and lose my strength? Am I the egg that starts with a malleable heart, but changes with the heat? Did I have a fluid spirit, but after death, a break up, a financial hardship, or some other trial, have I become hardened and stiff? Does my shell look the same, but on the inside am I bitter and tough with a stiff spirit and a hardened heart? Or am I like the coffee bean? The bean actually changes the hot water, the very circumstance that brings the pain. When the water gets hot, it releases the fragrance and flavor. If you are like the bean, when things are at their worst, you get better and change the situation around you. When the hours are the darkest and trials are their greatest do you elevate to another level? How do you handle adversity? ARE YOU A CARROT, AN EGG, OR A COFFEE BEAN?make an essay using this guide questions:1. what is the story about?2. what message does it convey?3. as a family how can you apply the lessons you learned from the story?​</h2><br />
