(Ancient Indian Proverb) He who asks is a fool for five minutes, but he who does not ask remains a fool forever. (Chinese proverb) Our greatest glory is not in never failing, but in rising up every time we fail. (Ralph Waldo Emerson) In order to succeed, we must first believe that we can. (Nikos Kazantzakis) By failing to prepare you are preparing to fail. (Benjamin Franklin) There is no passion to be found playing small-in settling for a life that is less than the one you are capable of living. (Nelson Mandela) People will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel. (Maya Angelou) Too many of us are not living our dreams because we are living our fears. (Les Brown) I am not a product of my circumstances. I am a product of my decisions. (Stephen Covey) Build your own dreams, or someone else will hire you to build theirs. (Farrah Gray)​</a>
