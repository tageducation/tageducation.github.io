It has thick fur and pointed muzzle. Wolves and foxes hunt other animals. Sometimes, they end up hunting each other. One night, a fox met a wolf in the forest. The wolf was very hungry and in a terrible mood. So the wolf said to the fox, “Don't move. I'm going to eat you this minute." As he spoke, the wolf backed the fox up against a tree. The fox realized she could not run away. "I have to use my wits instead of my legs,” she said to herself. "I could have been a good dinner for you last year. I was then very fat and plump. But I had three babies then. Now, I'm slim and not delicious." "I don't care if you are plump or not. I don't care how many babies you have. I'm going to eat you right now!" The wolf began closing in on the fox. “Stop!”, the fox shouted. “Look how skinny I am. I ran off all my fat looking for my babies. But I know a place where you can find something good and fat." Wolf backed off and listen to Fox. “There is a well near here. In the bottom of it is a big round piece of meat. You can get it instead of eating me. Shall we go?” The wolf trotted off after the fox, making sure that she could not run away. They came upon a well. “See for yourself. What a fat juicy piece of meat is at the bottom of this well. I wanted to get if for my babies, but you can have it. Inside the well was a delicious looking yellow round piece of meat. Above the well, the moon shone bright and clear.

The man said, “Aren’t you ashamed of yourself for overloading that poor donkey with you and your son?”The man and the boy got off and tried to think about what to do. They thought and they thought, till at last, they cut down a pole tied the donkey’s feet to it, and raised the pole and the donkey to their shoulders. They went along in the middle of the laughter of all who met them till they came to Market Bridge. The donkey, getting one of his feet loose, kicked out and caused the boy to drop his end of the pole.

So the man put the boy on the donkey and went on their way. But soon they passed a group of men, one of whom said, “See that lazy boy, he lets his father walk while he rides.”So the man ordered his boy to get off and got on himself. But they hadn’t far when they passed three women, one of whom said to the other, “Shame on that lazy old  man to let his poor little son walk along.”  Well, the man didn’t know what to do, but at last, he took his Boy up before him on the donkey. By this time they had come to the town, and the passerby began to tease and point at them. The man stopped and asked why. The man said, “Aren’t you ashamed of yourself for overloading that poor donkey with you and your son?”The man and the boy got off and tried to think about what to do. They thought and they thought, till at last, they cut down a pole tied the donkey’s feet to it, and raised the pole and the donkey to their shoulders. They went along in the middle of the laughter of all who met them till they came to Market Bridge. The donkey, getting one of his feet loose, kicked out and caused the boy to drop his end of the pole. In the struggle, the donkey fell over the bridge, and with his feet tied together, he drowned. “That will teach you,” said an old man who had followed them: “Please all, and you will please none.”Answer the following questions:1.

It has a pointed nose and ears, a bushy tail and thick fur. The fox is said to be a very clever animal in fooling others. The wolf is a wild animal that looks like a dog, too. It has thick fur and pointed muzzle. Wolves and foxes hunt other animals. Sometimes, they end up hunting each other. One night, a fox met a wolf in the forest. The wolf was very hungry and in a terrible mood. So the wolf said to the fox, “Don't move. I'm going to eat you this minute." As he spoke, the wolf backed the fox up against a tree. The fox realized she could not run away. "I have to use my wits instead of my legs,” she said to herself. "I could have been a good dinner for you last year. I was then very fat and plump. But I had three babies then. Now, I'm slim and not delicious." "I don't care if you are plump or not. I don't care how many babies you have. I'm going to eat you right now!" The wolf began closing in on the fox. “Stop!”, the fox shouted. “Look how skinny I am. I ran off all my fat looking for my babies. But I know a place where you can find something good and fat." Wolf backed off and listen to Fox. “There is a well near here. In the bottom of it is a big round piece of meat. You can get it instead of eating me. Shall we go?” The wolf trotted off after the fox, making sure that she could not run away. They came upon a well. “See for yourself. What a fat juicy piece of meat is at the bottom of this well. I wanted to get if for my babies, but you can have it. Inside the well was a delicious looking yellow round piece of meat. Above the well, the moon shone bright and clear. The wolf leaned over the well wondering how to get the piece of meat.  the fox humped up wuiclly and pushed the wolf  down  into the deedo well.im a sly old mother  fox ! fox said  to herself question1.who were the  characters of the story?2.where did the story  happen?3.what did the fox  do to be  not eaten for dinner  by the word?4.why did the  wolf not eat  the fox?5.what was the  bottom of the  well that looked  delicious  and good?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>THE Fox invited the Stork to dinner; and, being disposed to divert himself at the expence of his guest, provided nothing for the entertainment, but a soup, in a wide shallow dish. This himself could lap up with a great deal of ease, but the Stork, who could but just dip in the point of his bill, was not a bit the better all the while: however, in a few days after, he returned the compliment, and invited the Fox; but suffered nothing to be brought to table but some minced meat in a glass jar; the neck of which was so deep and so narrow, that though the Stork with his long bill made a shift to fill his belly, all that the Fox, who was very hungry, could do, was to lick the brims, as the Stork slabbered them with his eating.

But they hadn’t far when they passed three women, one of whom said to the other, “Shame on that lazy old  man to let his poor little son walk along.”  Well, the man didn’t know what to do, but at last, he took his Boy up before him on the donkey. By this time they had come to the town, and the passerby began to tease and point at them. The man stopped and asked why. The man said, “Aren’t you ashamed of yourself for overloading that poor donkey with you and your son?”The man and the boy got off and tried to think about what to do. They thought and they thought, till at last, they cut down a pole tied the donkey’s feet to it, and raised the pole and the donkey to their shoulders. They went along in the middle of the laughter of all who met them till they came to Market Bridge. The donkey, getting one of his feet loose, kicked out and caused the boy to drop his end of the pole. In the struggle, the donkey fell over the bridge, and with his feet tied together, he drowned. “That will teach you,” said an old man who had followed them: “Please all, and you will please none.”Answer the following questions:1.

So the man put the boy on the donkey and went on their way. But soon they passed a group of men, one of whom said, “See that lazy boy, he lets his father walk while he rides.”So the man ordered his boy to get off and got on himself. But they hadn’t far when they passed three women, one of whom said to the other, “Shame on that lazy old  man to let his poor little son walk along.”  Well, the man didn’t know what to do, but at last, he took his Boy up before him on the donkey. By this time they had come to the town, and the passerby began to tease and point at them. The man stopped and asked why. The man said, “Aren’t you ashamed of yourself for overloading that poor donkey with you and your son?”The man and the boy got off and tried to think about what to do. They thought and they thought, till at last, they cut down a pole tied the donkey’s feet to it, and raised the pole and the donkey to their shoulders. They went along in the middle of the laughter of all who met them till they came to Market Bridge. The donkey, getting one of his feet loose, kicked out and caused the boy to drop his end of the pole. In the struggle, the donkey fell over the bridge, and with his feet tied together, he drowned. “That will teach you,” said an old man who had followed them: “Please all, and you will please none.”Answer the following questions:1.
