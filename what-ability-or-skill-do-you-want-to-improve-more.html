                                            Eating HabitsWhat is physical activity?World Health Organization (WHO) defines physical activity as any bodily movement produced by skeletal muscles that requires energy expenditure including activities undertaken while working, playing, carrying out household chores, travelling, and engaging in recreational pursuits. The term "physical activity" should not be confused with "exercise", which is a subcategory of physical activity that is planned, structured,repetitive, and aims to improve or maintain one or more components of physical fitness. Beyond exercise, any other physical activity that is done during leisure time, for transport to get to and from places, or as part of a person's work, has a health benefit. Further, both moderate and vigorous intensity physical activity improve health. Dance could be part of your daily physical activities. Even a simple step or body movement is already a dance. Like Hip Hop, this requires proper techniques, practice, and interest to perform the dance moves and routines But before you engage into Hip-Hop dancing, you must assess first your physical abilities, daily exercise program and eating habits. Like other physicalactivities, dance requires a minimum normal balance of a healthy mind and body.What is Exercise?Exercise is any bodily activity that enhances or maintains physical fitness and overall health and wellness. It is performed for various reasons, to aid growth and improve strength, preventing aging, developing muscles and the cardiovascular system, honingathletic skills, weight loss or maintenance, improving health and for enjoyment.Many individuals choose to exercise outdoors where they can congregate in groups, socialize, and enhance well-being. In terms of health benefits, the amount of recommended exercisedepends upon the goal, the type of exercise, and the age of the person. Even doing a small amount of exercise is healthier than doing none.Eating Habits We can always eat the food that we want. There is nothing wrong with eating. It only goes wrong if we consume less or more that our body needs and when we eat unhealthy food. This can lead to being underweight, overweight, or even obese. It is alarning to see that many are suffering frorn malnutrition, overweight, and obesity. Underweight people are often found to suffer from malnutrition due to lack of adequate nutrients in the body. Many of them do not get the right number of calories to fuel their bodies thus, they tend to lack the energy to do regular tasks at home, school, and work. Their immune system also gets weak and compromised, making them prone to health risk issues such as anemia and osteoporosis. Follow up Questions:1. What have you learned after reading?2.

                            14. Eating HabitsWhat is physical activity?World Health Organization (WHO) defines physical activity as any bodily movement produced by skeletal muscles that requires energy expenditure including activities undertaken while working, playing, carrying out household chores, travelling, and engaging in recreational pursuits. The term "physical activity" should not be confused with "exercise", which is a subcategory of physical activity that is planned, structured,repetitive, and aims to improve or maintain one or more components of physical fitness. Beyond exercise, any other physical activity that is done during leisure time, for transport to get to and from places, or as part of a person's work, has a health benefit. Further, both moderate and vigorous intensity physical activity improve health. Dance could be part of your daily physical activities. Even a simple step or body movement is already a dance. Like Hip Hop, this requires proper techniques, practice, and interest to perform the dance moves and routines But before you engage into Hip-Hop dancing, you must assess first your physical abilities, daily exercise program and eating habits. Like other physicalactivities, dance requires a minimum normal balance of a healthy mind and body.What is Exercise?Exercise is any bodily activity that enhances or maintains physical fitness and overall health and wellness. It is performed for various reasons, to aid growth and improve strength, preventing aging, developing muscles and the cardiovascular system, honingathletic skills, weight loss or maintenance, improving health and for enjoyment.Many individuals choose to exercise outdoors where they can congregate in groups, socialize, and enhance well-being. In terms of health benefits, the amount of recommended exercisedepends upon the goal, the type of exercise, and the age of the person. Even doing a small amount of exercise is healthier than doing none.Eating Habits We can always eat the food that we want. There is nothing wrong with eating. It only goes wrong if we consume less or more that our body needs and when we eat unhealthy food. This can lead to being underweight, overweight, or even obese. It is alarning to see that many are suffering frorn malnutrition, overweight, and obesity. Underweight people are often found to suffer from malnutrition due to lack of adequate nutrients in the body. Many of them do not get the right number of calories to fuel their bodies thus, they tend to lack the energy to do regular tasks at home, school, and work. Their immune system also gets weak and compromised, making them prone to health risk issues such as anemia and osteoporosis. Follow up Questions:1. What have you learned after reading?2.
