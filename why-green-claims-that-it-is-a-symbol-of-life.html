The Parable of the Rainbow Colors 
Juan M. Flavier
It all started as innocent statements by each of the colors. No attempt was made by anyone to denigrate the others. There was even an element of restraint and humility.
 But as time went on, the colors declarations became stronger and haughty with an overtone which tended to out down the other colors. Their claim became very explicit as to who was the best color. 
It reached the point when the colors were actually quarrelling. 
Said the color RED, “I am the brightest! for red is the most striking. Why? Life-sustaining blood is colored red. I represent courage and bravery. Even love symbols like the heart and the roses presented are red in color.”
The color YELLOW retorted, “What can be brighter than my yellow exemplified by the sun? I am the color of gaiety and of warmth. Without me, only the eye-glaring ones remains.”
What an outlandish claim! Interposed the color ORANGE. “Sunrise is orange, not
yellow. I am more important because I represent health and strength. Look at the ripened fruits and vegetables, they are predominantly orange.”
Well, if you are talking about vegetables and leaves, you are referring to my color, declared the color GREEN. “I am the symbol of life. All that thrives in the fields and the forests is the greenery I provide. I am the most important color.”
The color BLUE could not help it anymore so it shouted, “What can be more expansive than the skies and the seas? Do you forget that the farthest skies and the deepest seas are blue? I represent patriotism. I stand for the depth of feelings and extensive spaces.”
The color INDIGO came out with a statement, “You talk about wide areas. I hope you realized the largest area in the world is silence and I represent that dimension with my color. It means thoughtfulness. It is prayer expressed in the deepest of feelings.”
“Aha! You forget the pomp of royalty and power is VIOLET, shouted the color. I am wisdom and authority. What can be more overwhelming?”
Suddenly, the rain interrupted the contentious exchange of arguments. “Yes, you all have your unique features. But all of you have a special role. And more importantly, you need each other to give the mix of colors for beauty. Because of your quarrelling. . . God has asked me to inform you of a decision. From now on, you will not be seen separately. When it rains, a strip of colors will appear in the sky. You will all appear together. You will be called a rainbow. You will then represent cooperation and hope. The rainbow in the sky.”
With that, the rain disappeared.
Task 5 Analyze the situations based on the “Parable of Rainbow Colors” written by Juan M. Flavier. Choose which color of the rainbow shows the following scenario in our lives. 
1. The Frontliners are doing their bests to save lives. 
2. A soldier is dying in a battle because of love for country. 
3. A journalist has the power to change someone’s way of thinking. 
4. The farmers are very happy because of the good harvest this year. 
5. There are volunteers who planted plants and trees to save our forests.

                            13. Task 4 Read and Enjoy
The Parable of the Rainbow Colors 
Juan M. Flavier
It all started as innocent statements by each of the colors. No attempt was made by anyone to denigrate the others. There was even an element of restraint and humility.
 But as time went on, the colors declarations became stronger and haughty with an overtone which tended to out down the other colors. Their claim became very explicit as to who was the best color. 
It reached the point when the colors were actually quarrelling. 
Said the color RED, “I am the brightest! for red is the most striking. Why? Life-sustaining blood is colored red. I represent courage and bravery. Even love symbols like the heart and the roses presented are red in color.”
The color YELLOW retorted, “What can be brighter than my yellow exemplified by the sun? I am the color of gaiety and of warmth. Without me, only the eye-glaring ones remains.”
What an outlandish claim! Interposed the color ORANGE. “Sunrise is orange, not
yellow. I am more important because I represent health and strength. Look at the ripened fruits and vegetables, they are predominantly orange.”
Well, if you are talking about vegetables and leaves, you are referring to my color, declared the color GREEN. “I am the symbol of life. All that thrives in the fields and the forests is the greenery I provide. I am the most important color.”
The color BLUE could not help it anymore so it shouted, “What can be more expansive than the skies and the seas? Do you forget that the farthest skies and the deepest seas are blue? I represent patriotism. I stand for the depth of feelings and extensive spaces.”
The color INDIGO came out with a statement, “You talk about wide areas. I hope you realized the largest area in the world is silence and I represent that dimension with my color. It means thoughtfulness. It is prayer expressed in the deepest of feelings.”
“Aha! You forget the pomp of royalty and power is VIOLET, shouted the color. I am wisdom and authority. What can be more overwhelming?”
Suddenly, the rain interrupted the contentious exchange of arguments. “Yes, you all have your unique features. But all of you have a special role. And more importantly, you need each other to give the mix of colors for beauty. Because of your quarrelling. . . God has asked me to inform you of a decision. From now on, you will not be seen separately. When it rains, a strip of colors will appear in the sky. You will all appear together. You will be called a rainbow. You will then represent cooperation and hope. The rainbow in the sky.”
With that, the rain disappeared.

                        <p>Answer:</p><p>School Choice – An Educational Custom Fit</p><p></p><p>Explanation:</p><p></p><p>School Choice – An Educational Custom Fit</p><p></p><p>Imagine if only one size of pants were sold in stores and government regulations</p><p></p><p>wouldn’t allow any other size to be made available to consumers. This may sound crazy but it’s</p><p></p><p>much like what’s happening with the education of our nation’s children. As Americans we enjoy</p><p></p><p>a wide range of personal choice, and thankfully it includes our ability to select the pants that fit</p><p></p><p>us best. But think for a moment about traditional public education. For decades the public school</p><p></p><p>system has offered a one size fits all approach to educating our nation’s children. As we</p><p></p><p>approached the 21st century, the public school system began to show its age. More and more</p><p></p><p>children began to fall behind in a rapidly changing environment marked by the introduction of</p><p></p><p>personal computers and later the internet. Sensing a need for change, many people began to push</p><p></p><p>for new educational models that would keep up with the times. This marked the beginning of the</p><p></p><p>school choice movement. Both charter schools and school voucher programs are collectively</p><p></p><p>referred to as “school choice” initiatives, in that they allow parents freedom to choose</p><p></p><p>individualized education options for their children that are outside of the traditional “one size fits</p><p></p><p>all’ public school system. A school voucher program provides parents with certificates that are</p><p></p><p>used to pay for education at a school of their choice, rather than the public school to which they</p><p></p><p>are assigned. Charter schools on the other hand are publicly funded schools that have been freed</p><p></p><p>from inefficient public school system rules and regulations in exchange for accountability to</p><p></p><p>produce positive, measurable results. These agreed to results are set forth in each school’s  </p><p></p><p>charter. The ability for parents to choose an education path that is best for their children is an</p><p></p><p>exciting opportunity currently revolutionizing public education.</p><p></p><p>Considering the importance of public education, it’s understandable that many people</p><p></p><p>would be hesitant to make changes to the system. Those opposed to school choice site concerns</p><p></p><p>that public schools would be traded in for profit based education corporations that care more for</p><p></p><p>financial profit than the individual education of students. Others site concern for what appears to</p><p></p><p>be government sponsorship of private religious schools through the funding provided by various</p><p></p><p>school voucher programs. Those against choice should be commended for demonstrating a</p><p></p><p>committed concern for the education of our nation’s children, but the overwhelming evidence</p><p></p><p>proves that school choice is the right direction for the future.</p><p></p><p>A characteristic of privately operated charter schools is the focus on success through</p><p></p><p>measurable achievement and accountability. Imagine again the one size fits all pants store, how</p><p></p><p>could they stay in business if another store offered various sizes and styles? Simple, they</p><p></p><p>couldn’t, not when faced with competition that provides a better choice for consumers. The</p><p></p><p>traditional public school system of the past had no competition. There was no incentive to</p><p></p><p>improve the quality of education they provided since there was nothing to measure it against.</p><p></p><p>The school choice movement for the first time introduced an alternative to poorly performing</p><p></p><p>public schools. Charter schools make a commitment, or charter, to achieve a measurable level of</p><p></p><p>educational performance within a defined period of time. This concept works and has produced</p><p></p><p>results in places like Chicago, where charter schools show better performance in ACT test</p><p></p><p>scores, high school graduation rates, and greater numbers of students continuing on to college</p><p></p><p></p><br />
