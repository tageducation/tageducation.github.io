It frames the small intestine on three sides. Despite its being about one-half as long as the small intestine, it is called large because it is more than twice the diameter of the small intestine, about 3 inches.The large intestine, also known as the large bowel, is the last part of the gastrointestinal tract and of the digestive system in vertebrates. Water is absorbed here and the remaining waste material is stored as feces before being removed by defecation.<p></p>Small Intestine-The small intestine is the major site for digestion and absorption of nutrients.<p></p>Excretory System-The excretory system is responsible for removing waste from your body.<p></p>Nervous System-The Nervous System is the body's “control center.” The CNS has various centers located within it that carry out the sensory, motor and integration of data.<p></p>Respiratory System-respiratory system allow us to breathe. They bring oxygen into our bodies (called inspiration, or inhalation) and send carbon dioxide out (called expiration, or exhalation). This exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide is called respiration.<p></p>Kidneys-kidneysIt includes the kidneys, ureters, bladder and urethra. The kidneys are bean-shaped organs which help the body produce urine to get rid of unwanted waste substances. When urine is formed, tubes called ureters transport it to the urinary bladder, where it is stored and excreted via the urethra.<p></p><p></p>Nephrons-Each of your kidneys is made up of about a million filtering units called nephrons. <p></p>Brain-It has three main parts: cerebrum, cerebellum and brainstem.<p></p>Neuron-Neurons are cells within the nervous system that transmit information to other nerve cells, muscle, or gland cells. Most neurons have a cell body, an axon, and dendrites.<p></p>Spinal Cord-The spinal cord lies inside the spinal column, which is made up of 33 bones called vertebrae.<p></p>Lungs-The lungs are a pair of spongy, air-filled organs located on either side of the chest (thorax). <p></p>Larynx-Also called voice box, the area of the throat containing the vocal cords and used for breathing, swallowing, and talking.<p></p>Respiration Process-1.When you inhale through your nose or mouth, 2.air travels down the pharynx (back of the throat), passes through your larynx (voice box) and 3.into your trachea (windpipe). 4.Your trachea is divided into 2 air passages called bronchial tubes. 5.One bronchial tube leads to the left lung, the other to the right lung.#ScienceDaily<br />
