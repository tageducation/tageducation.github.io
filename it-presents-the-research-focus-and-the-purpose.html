It focuses on educating its reader. Its purpose is not primarily to amuse, but to enlighten and instruct. The objective is to explain and analyze information by presenting an idea, relevant evidence, and appropriate discussion. 4. Factual/Personal Recount Purpose: Recounts focus on retelling events and are generally intended to inform and/or entertain. 5.

That said, there can be many reasons for story telling in the first place, for example, myths can be told to explain natural phenomena and legends can be used to pass on cultural beliefs. Storytelling itself is a means to entertain and inform readers and allows for the writer to express themselves creatively and imaginatively. There are many types of narrative text, including myths, fables, traditional tales, novels, short stories etc. 2. EXPLANATORY TEXT Purpose: It moves beyond providing straightforward descriptions to looking at things like causes and reasons. They move beyond a retelling of what happened such as in a simple report, to address the why and how of what happened. 3. EXPOSITORY TEXT Purpose: It exists to provide facts in a way that is educational and purposeful.The text is fact-based with the purpose of exposing the truth through a reliable source. It focuses on educating its reader. Its purpose is not primarily to amuse, but to enlighten and instruct. The objective is to explain and analyze information by presenting an idea, relevant evidence, and appropriate discussion. 4. Factual/Personal Recount Purpose: Recounts focus on retelling events and are generally intended to inform and/or entertain. 5. Persuasive Text Purpose: Its purpose is to convince the reader of the merits of adopting a particular viewpoint or taking a specific course of action ​</h2><br />

One’s choice of words greatly affects how the audience perceives the speech</strong></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.  </p><p>Use visuals when necessary. When possible and appropriate, visuals like PowerPoint slides can help support the speech being delivered. This should be done in a way that visual aids will not overpower the speech or distract the audience. </p><p>2. When planning a speech, it is important to know about the audience and to adapt the message to the audience. You want to prepare an audience-centered speech, a speech with a focus on the audience. In public speaking, you are speaking to and for your audience; thus, understanding the audience is a major part of the speech-making process.</p><p>3. Your purpose will be your guiding principle throughout your speech. Although during your speech you may be doing several things such as persuading and entertaining, your speech will be more effective if you focus in on one main purpose. In other words, what exactly do you want to communicate to your audience? Making sure that you have a clear purpose ensures that your core message (and call to action) will ultimately resonate with your audience.</p><p>4. In your discussion you must draw together your research question and your own research results. If the discussion is in a self-contained chapter or section you will need to briefly summarise the major findings that come from the research and relate them to what you originally proposed to find out.</p><p>5. Whether you are delivering a prepared or an impromptu speech, maintaining composure can always be an issue. The weeks of planning and preparation may be put to waste if you keep on showing unnecessary movements as a sign of nervousness. Taking deep breaths and having a focused mindset can do the magic of staying relaxed.</p><p>6. The connection between you and the audience is what allows them to truly listen to your message and be inspired. It takes a lot of practice and experience to become a powerful public speaker, and by emulating the mentioned characteristics of effective public speakers you can become more inspiring and more influential.</p><p>7. Watch your words. One’s choice of words greatly affects how the audience perceives the speech. One must be careful enough not to use words that might put his or her reliability and reputation into jeopardy. 9. Speak with clarity. One should observe proper pronunciation, stress, intonation, juncture, diction, tone, and pacing when delivering a speech.
