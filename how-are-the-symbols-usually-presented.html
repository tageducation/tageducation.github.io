                        <p>Symbols take the form of words, sounds, gestures, ideas, or visual images and are used to convey other ideas and beliefs.

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>A symbol is a mark, sign, or word that indicates, signifies, or is understood as representing an idea, object, or relationship. Symbols allow people to go beyond what is known or seen by creating linkages between otherwise very different concepts and experiences. All communication (and data processing) is achieved through the use of symbols. Symbols take the form of words, sounds, gestures, ideas, or visual images and are used to convey other ideas and beliefs. For example, a red octagon is a common symbol for "STOP"; on maps, blue lines often represent rivers; and a red rose often symbolizes love and compassion. Numerals are symbols for numbers; letters of an alphabet may be symbols for certain phonemes; and personal names are symbols representing individuals. The variable 'x', in a mathematical equation, may symbolize the position of a particle in space.</p><br />

What is the importance of using symbols to convey a message or information?4. How are these symbols presented in terms of fonts, images, colors, design andothers?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1)Symbols bridge the gap between the what we perceive as reality in the physical world and what we think this experience is or may be. Symbols bridge the gap between the abstract realm of thoughts and the imagination and sensual sensation. In other words, unlike other animals, humans have adapted to their physical surroundings by constructing a layer beyond physical existence – a symbolic universe that extends beyond the material world's external reality. Humans learned to distinguish between what they were doing in the moment and the sense they ascribed or correlated with the encounter. Symbols serve a function in society by providing a sense of community, social harmony, aesthetics, power, and identification.
</p><p></p><p>2) Symbols take the form of words, sounds, gestures, ideas, or visual images and are used to convey other ideas and beliefs. For example, a red octagon is a common symbol for "STOP"; on maps, blue lines often represent rivers; and a red rose often symbolizes love and compassion.</p><p></p><p>3)Humans, consciously and subconsciously, are always striving to make sense of their surrounding world. Symbols—such as gestures, signs, objects, signals, and words—help people understand that world. They provide clues to understanding experiences by conveying recognizable meanings that are shared by societies</p><p></p><p>4)A logo is the strongest symbol of a brand. It's what consumers stop at when scanning the shelves, trying to choose between 20 seemingly similar products. These signs and symbols helps people to make decisions faster, and it helps people to feel like they made the right purchasing decision. The psychology of logos -- from the fonts, colors, and shapes -- effect how company's design them; an important decision that will impact how the company is viewed by the public

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>A symbol is a mark, sign, or word that indicates, signifies, or is understood as representing an idea, object, or relationship. Symbols allow people to go beyond what is known or seen by creating linkages between otherwise very different concepts and experiences. All communication (and data processing) is achieved through the use of symbols. Symbols take the form of words, sounds, gestures, ideas, or visual images and are used to convey other ideas and beliefs. For example, a red octagon is a common symbol for "STOP"; on maps, blue lines often represent rivers; and a red rose often symbolizes love and compassion. Numerals are symbols for numbers; letters of an alphabet may be symbols for certain phonemes; and personal names are symbols representing individuals. The variable 'x', in a mathematical equation, may symbolize the position of a particle in space.</p><p></p><p>Silhouette of a red octagon</p><p>A red octagon symbolizes "stop" even without the word.</p><p></p><p>Wearing variously colored ribbons is a symbolic action that shows support for certain campaigns.</p><p>The academic study of symbols is semiotics. In cartography, an organized collection of symbols forms a legend for a map.</p><br />
