                            13. Create a report on the topic given below.Cooperatives and Trade UnionsCooperatives are defined by the international Labour Organization ( ILO ) as " an autonomous association of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise."Cooperatives embody characteristics of a self- sustaining communal society where individuals own, control, finance, work for, and benefit from the products or services they offer in their own organization. Cooperatives contribute to the economy by ensuring the production and sale of goods while also lending economic assistance to those in need.For example, as an agricultural cooperative helps farmers sell their produce both to members and non- members of the cooperative, pooling the earnings and distributing it among the farmers. The cooperative also helps them buy the supplies and equipment needed for farming​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Introduction:</p><p>Cooperatives and trade unions are two forms of collective organizations that are established to represent the interests of individuals in the economy. The purpose of this report is to discuss the concept of cooperatives and trade unions, their similarities and differences, and the role they play in the economy.</p><p></p><p>Definition of Cooperatives:</p><p>According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), cooperatives are autonomous associations of individuals who voluntarily unite to meet their economic, social, and cultural needs through a jointly-owned and democratically controlled enterprise. The members of cooperatives own, control, finance, and benefit from the products or services they offer in their organization.</p><p></p><p>Characteristics of Cooperatives:</p><p>Cooperatives embody the characteristics of a self-sustaining communal society. They are owned and controlled by their members, who elect a board of directors to oversee the operations of the organization. They are democratically controlled, with each member having one vote. Cooperatives are also self-financing, with members pooling their resources to provide capital for the organization. Finally, cooperatives operate on the principle of equitable distribution of benefits, with profits shared among members based on their participation.</p><p></p><p>Examples of Cooperatives:</p><p>Cooperatives exist in various sectors of the economy, including agriculture, finance, housing, and healthcare. For example, an agricultural cooperative helps farmers sell their produce, pool the earnings, and distribute them among the farmers. The cooperative also assists them in purchasing supplies and equipment needed for farming.</p><p></p><p>Definition of Trade Unions:</p><p>Trade unions are organizations of workers that seek to protect and advance the interests of their members. They negotiate collective bargaining agreements with employers on wages, benefits, and working conditions. Trade unions also provide support for their members, including legal representation, job training, and health and safety programs.</p><p></p><p>Characteristics of Trade Unions:</p><p>Trade unions are democratic organizations, with members electing their leaders and voting on important decisions. They are also collective organizations, with members bargaining collectively with employers for better wages, benefits, and working conditions. Trade unions operate on the principle of solidarity, with members supporting each other to achieve their common goals.</p><p></p><p>Examples of Trade Unions:</p><p>Trade unions exist in various industries, including manufacturing, healthcare, education, and transportation. For example, the National Education Association (NEA) is a trade union that represents teachers and education support professionals in the United States. The NEA negotiates collective bargaining agreements with school districts on behalf of its members and provides support for its members, including professional development, legal representation, and advocacy.</p><p></p><p>Similarities and Differences between Cooperatives and Trade Unions:</p><p>Cooperatives and trade unions are similar in that they are both collective organizations that seek to represent the interests of their members. They are also both democratic organizations, with members electing their leaders and voting on important decisions. However, there are also significant differences between cooperatives and trade unions. Cooperatives are organizations of individuals who own and control their own enterprise, while trade unions are organizations of workers who negotiate with employers on behalf of their members. Cooperatives operate on the principle of equitable distribution of benefits, while trade unions seek to negotiate better wages, benefits, and working conditions for their members.</p><p></p><p>Conclusion:</p><p>Cooperatives and trade unions are important forms of collective organizations that represent the interests of individuals in the economy. Cooperatives provide a means for individuals to own and control their own enterprise, while trade unions provide a means for workers to negotiate with employers for better wages, benefits, and working conditions. Both cooperatives and trade unions are democratic organizations that operate on the principle of solidarity, with members supporting each other to achieve their common goals.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />
