In these situations, your pulse quickens, you breathe faster, your muscles tense, and your brain uses more oxygen and increases activity—all functions aimed at survival and in response to stress. In non-life-threatening situations, stress can motivate people, such as when they need to take a test or interview for a new job.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Well, as you may know, stress is our body's response to pressure. One of the important things that I've learned about stress is that the more I pressure myself the more stressful I've become. And that is why I should refrain from things that pressure me a lot and leads to stress. Many different situations or life events can cause stress, and sad to say we can't prevent those situations because as long as we're still living we will encounter them whether you like it or not. However, stress may be good or bad. They both had these positive and negative responses. But we find stress always a bad response. I mean, we all are being like that. We all focus on bad things that are happening to us, but how about the good or positive responses. Yes, stress may have a bad response but it also has a good response. For instance, stress can help you meet daily challenges and motivates you to reach your goals. Stress can help you accomplish tasks more efficiently. It can even boost memory. Stress is also a vital warning system, producing the fight-or-flight response. What important is stress is lead us to reflect on our mistakes. When you've become stress you feel like being alone. Think of ways to get rid of the feeling of being pressured and then you'll be able to fix yourself and restart again. Free yourself from bad vibes and treat yourself like you treat your loved ones. No one on this planet is exempted to stress. You may be rich or poor. We sure all feel the pressure that leads to this stress. However, a reminder again, everything has its positive and negative responses. and to be happy learn to think of positive responses in your life. </p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Exact 300 words ✓<br />
