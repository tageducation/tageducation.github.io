A sample of 500 volunteers from a cityreveals that the efficacy rate is 88% with a standard deviation of 3%. At 1%significance level, check the veracity of the statement of the company.2. The average income of a customer service representative is P 23,000. Asurvey was conducted among 25 customer service representatives in the cityand the mean is 24,000 and the standard deviation is p 5,000.

A single dosage of the drug should contain 12 mg of theactive ingredient. Thirty random dosages of the drug revealed that the averageamount of the active ingredient is 12.1 mg, and the standard deviation is 0.5mg. Is there enough evidence with 99% confidence level that the averageamount of the active ingredient is greater than 12 mg?4. A remittance center claims that the average transaction cost of sendingmoney through their remittance center is 3% of the amount. A sample of 20clients revealed that the mean transaction cost is 3.4% and the standarddeviation is 0.5%. Test at 10% significance level whether the transaction fee ishigher than the claim of the remittance center,5. According to a guidance counselor, an average student spent less than 7hours each day for school works. A sample of 100 students in a certain schoolreveals that the mean hours spent of the students is 6.5 hours with a standarddeviation of 0.8.

Survey of Academic and General Reading in English On 8th February 1999, a survey was conducted among 16 overseas postgraduate students at the University of England. The purpose of the survey was to discover the reading habits in English of the students. The survey was conducted by means of a questionnaire given to the students to complete. The first part of the questionnaire dealt with the type of reading and its frequency. The second section was concerned with newspapers: the type of items read and those that were read first. From the table of data, the most significant items are as follows. In the first section 81% of the students regularly read academic books" while 44% regularly read academic journals. Nothing else is read regularly or often by 40% or more of the students. The following comments can be made about the reading of newspapers, magazines and fiction. 75% sometimes read regional or local newspapers, 69% sometimes read books of fiction, 62% sometimes read general magazines, and 56% sometimes read national daily newspapers. On the other hand, 37% never read Sunday newspapers and 31% never read fiction. in the second section, not surprisingly, 100% read news about their own country newspapers and 56% read this first. 94% read international news, 25% read this first. 81% read about Britain and look at radio and TV information. T nly other item that is usually read by more than 50% of the students is current aff ead by 56%). If any conclusions may be drawn from the data, they are, perhaps, as fol verseas students presumably have little time for general reading: most of their re ne is spent on books and journals on their own subject. Outside their studies m reading news about their own country, international news, and news about y probably spend most time watching TV and listening to the radio. m Academic Writing Course by R. R.

                                            Survey of Academic and General Reading in English On 8th February 1999, a survey was conducted among 16 overseas postgraduate students at the University of England. The purpose of the survey was to discover the reading habits in English of the students. The survey was conducted by means of a questionnaire given to the students to complete. The first part of the questionnaire dealt with the type of reading and its frequency. The second section was concerned with newspapers: the type of items read and those that were read first. From the table of data, the most significant items are as follows. In the first section 81% of the students regularly read academic books" while 44% regularly read academic journals. Nothing else is read regularly or often by 40% or more of the students. The following comments can be made about the reading of newspapers, magazines and fiction. 75% sometimes read regional or local newspapers, 69% sometimes read books of fiction, 62% sometimes read general magazines, and 56% sometimes read national daily newspapers. On the other hand, 37% never read Sunday newspapers and 31% never read fiction. In the second section, not surprisingly, 100% read news about their own country in newspapers and 56% read this first. 94% read international news, 25% read this first. 81% read about Britain and look at radio and TV information. The only other item that is usually read by more than 50% of the students is current affairs (read by 56%). If any conclusions may be drawn from the data, they are, perhaps, as follows. Overseas students presumably have little time for general reading: most of their reading time is spent on books and journals on their own subject. Outside their studies, apart from reading news about their own country, international news, and news about Britain, they probably spend most time watching TV and listening to the radio.

                            15. Survey of Academic and General Reading in English On 8th February 1999, a survey was conducted among 16 overseas postgraduate students at the University of England. The purpose of the survey was to discover the reading habits in English of the students. The survey was conducted by means of a questionnaire given to the students to complete. The first part of the questionnaire dealt with the type of reading and its frequency. The second section was concerned with newspapers: the type of items read and those that were read first. From the table of data, the most significant items are as follows. In the first section 81% of the students regularly read academic books" while 44% regularly read academic journals. Nothing else is read regularly or often by 40% or more of the students. The following comments can be made about the reading of newspapers, magazines and fiction. 75% sometimes read regional or local newspapers, 69% sometimes read books of fiction, 62% sometimes read general magazines, and 56% sometimes read national daily newspapers. On the other hand, 37% never read Sunday newspapers and 31% never read fiction. In the second section, not surprisingly, 100% read news about their own country in newspapers and 56% read this first. 94% read international news, 25% read this first. 81% read about Britain and look at radio and TV information. The only other item that is usually read by more than 50% of the students is current affairs (read by 56%). If any conclusions may be drawn from the data, they are, perhaps, as follows. Overseas students presumably have little time for general reading: most of their reading time is spent on books and journals on their own subject. Outside their studies, apart from reading news about their own country, international news, and news about Britain, they probably spend most time watching TV and listening to the radio.
