Youth Alcohol Usage:</p><p></p><p>Youth Alcohol UsageStrategic focus: Health</p><p></p><p>Among the twelfth graders in one survey, about 49% were found to have consumed alcohol a month before the survey was taken. The worst part of this is that the many parents are unaware of it. In fact, most of the parents don’t seem to have clear and personal talks with their children. This is considered to be one of the big reasons why these youngsters have been pulled into alcohol and drugs.</p><p></p><p>4. Transportation:</p><p></p><p>TransportationStrategic focus: Self-sufficiency</p><p></p><p>Transportation has often been one of the needs that cannot be met for people who live in poverty.

The number of deaths due to poverty has seen an exponential rise and the measures taken against the same seem to be moving at a snail pace while the poverty is galloping ahead.
