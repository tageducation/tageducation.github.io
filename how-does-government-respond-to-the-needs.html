                                            The New Normal
Before, the world goes how it used to be, Where its people can move freely, 
Busy going in/out to work, school or own businesses, 
But all these changes suddenly. 
Oh! my world, what happened to us, With just a virus that changes a lot, 
The word normal becomes new normal, 
A kind of living that is new to all. 
Wearing a mask, social distancing, Disinfecting places, washing hands and sanitizing, 
Young and aging stayed at home, 
These are the preventive measures the government needs to do so. 
Now few a people are ranting, Because of lockdown and community quarantine, 
Some are bored, some are hungry, They have nothing to do but to be angry. 
A virus COVID-19 came so fast, 
How our education now? Someone asks, 
But the Department of Education did not stop and immediately respond, 
Different modalities in learning are offered in advance. 
Though children need to stay at home, Imparting of knowledge will continue to flow, 
We should work together and stand tall, 
And beat this pandemic and never let us fall.

                            17. The New Normal
Before, the world goes how it used to be, Where its people can move freely, 
Busy going in/out to work, school or own businesses, 
But all these changes suddenly. 
Oh! my world, what happened to us, With just a virus that changes a lot, 
The word normal becomes new normal, 
A kind of living that is new to all. 
Wearing a mask, social distancing, Disinfecting places, washing hands and sanitizing, 
Young and aging stayed at home, 
These are the preventive measures the government needs to do so. 
Now few a people are ranting, Because of lockdown and community quarantine, 
Some are bored, some are hungry, They have nothing to do but to be angry. 
A virus COVID-19 came so fast, 
How our education now? Someone asks, 
But the Department of Education did not stop and immediately respond, 
Different modalities in learning are offered in advance. 
Though children need to stay at home, Imparting of knowledge will continue to flow, 
We should work together and stand tall, 
And beat this pandemic and never let us fall.
