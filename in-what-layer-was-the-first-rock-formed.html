C. Identify the structure of the following passages.
____1. Chimpanzees and humans are alike in many ways. A baby chimp laughs when its mother tickles it. After chimpanzees fight, they give kisses and make up.
____2. How does rain form? Water droplets form from warm air. As the warm air rises in the sky it cools. Water vapor (invisible water in the air) always exist in our air. Warm air holds quite a bit of water. For example in the summer it is usually very humid. When enough of these droplets collect together, we see them as clouds. if the clouds are big enough and form even bigger drops. When the drops get heavy, they fall because of gravity, and you see and feel rain.
____3. The earth's surface is constantly changing through slow processes that we dont usually see. One is erosion. This has worn away rocks and mountains over million of years, caused by air, water, and wind. Another change is caused by earthquakes that originate deep inside the planet. More sudden and violent than erosion, an earthquake results when strains between Earth's plates produce shock waves. And. third process results when molten rock-forming material called lava, escapes onto the surface through gaps in the crust. what we experience is volcanic eruption.
____4. How are sedimentary rocks formed? Sedimentary rock is formed by the compression of layers of particles into a solid form. Sediments such as sand and mud settle onto the floors of oceans and lakes. Over a long period of time, several layers of sediments collect on the floor. Gradually these layers are pressed together for many thousands of years, fusing the small solid particles of mud and sand to form rock. This type of rock is called sedimentary rock.
____5. Do you want to make a kite? First, you must have all the materials needed for you to be able to make one. You must dampen cane to make flexible. Next, carefully bend cane to desired shape, then tie securely with thread. Then, lay frame on sheet of paper and trace around frame with pencil. After that, cut covering approximately 1 cm larger than outline and paint on covering over the frame carefully, and glue them down. Lastly, put strings one each and end tie the other ends in a knot.</a>

What will be the order of flavour in each layer?If you apply pressure on cakes, it will be deformed, flattened, or twisted. Just likethe layers in thc cake, rocks can also form layers due to sediments deposited onrocks or some forces that act on it which causes its deformation. These are forcesthat may bring alteration to rock layers or the change in its formation in theEarth's surface.In geologic time, it covers the whole sweep of Earth's history, from how and whenthe earth was first formed, to everything that has happened on, in, and to theentire planet up to now.In this module, descriptions, characteristics, and behaviour of rock layers will bediscussed. Relevant information will be given which serves as a guide as you gothrough with the lesson in the formation of rock layers.​</a>

But your favorite online game is going on and your friends are waiting for you. What will you do?2.Due to the effect of COVID -19 many learners were affected specially in their studies and in going to school. Do you prefer to have online classes or face to face classes? What will be your stand?3.Plants use the energy from sunlight to turn carbon dioxide (present in air) and water into sugar for food. This process is called photosynthesis. The green color of the leaves, called chlorophyll. It helps them to make food for the plant.4. The continuous changing of air around us is called weather. Wind, rain, and snow are the different forms of changes taken by weather. The lives of people are influenced by these changes. Many people are forced to stay in their houses when it rains or snow. Weather likewise influences individual’s choice of clothes. When the weather is hot and thick, one wears light clothes, tight when it is cold.”5.The Earth is composed of different layers. The first layer is the crust, it is very thin in comparison to the other three layers. The crust is only about 3 – 5 miles thick under the oceans and about 25 miles thick under the continents. The next is the mantle which is located directly under the sima. It is 1800 miles thick and the largest layer of the Earth. It is composed of very hot, dense rock. The outer core is like a ball of very hot metals. It is located about 1800 miles beneath the crust and is about 1400 miles thick. It is composed of melted metals, nickel and iron. Finally, the inner core has temperatures and pressures so great that the metals are squeezed together and are not able to move about like a liquid, but are forced to vibrate in place as a solid. It begins about 4000 miles beneath the crust and is about 800 miles thick. All in all, there are four layers of the Earth.”PATULONG PO THANK YOU!...​</a>

C. Identify the structure of the following passages.
____1. Chimpanzees and humans are alike in many ways. A baby chimp laughs when its mother tickles it. After chimpanzees fight, they give kisses and make up.
____2. How does rain form? Water droplets form from warm air. As the warm air rises in the sky it cools. Water vapor (invisible water in the air) always exist in our air. Warm air holds quite a bit of water. For example in the summer it is usually very humid. When enough of these droplets collect together, we see them as clouds. if the clouds are big enough and form even bigger drops. When the drops get heavy, they fall because of gravity, and you see and feel rain.
____3. The earth's surface is constantly changing through slow processes that we dont usually see. One is erosion. This has worn away rocks and mountains over million of years, caused by air, water, and wind. Another change is caused by earthquakes that originate deep inside the planet. More sudden and violent than erosion, an earthquake results when strains between Earth's plates produce shock waves. And. third process results when molten rock-forming material called lava, escapes onto the surface through gaps in the crust. what we experience is volcanic eruption.
____4. How are sedimentary rocks formed? Sedimentary rock is formed by the compression of layers of particles into a solid form. Sediments such as sand and mud settle onto the floors of oceans and lakes. Over a long period of time, several layers of sediments collect on the floor. Gradually these layers are pressed together for many thousands of years, fusing the small solid particles of mud and sand to form rock. This type of rock is called sedimentary rock.
____5. Do you want to make a kite? First, you must have all the materials needed for you to be able to make one. You must dampen cane to make flexible. Next, carefully bend cane to desired shape, then tie securely with thread. Then, lay frame on sheet of paper and trace around frame with pencil. After that, cut covering approximately 1 cm larger than outline and paint on covering over the frame carefully, and glue them down. Lastly, put strings one each and end tie the other ends in a knot.</h2><br />

What will be the order of flavour in each layer?If you apply pressure on cakes, it will be deformed, flattened, or twisted. Just likethe layers in thc cake, rocks can also form layers due to sediments deposited onrocks or some forces that act on it which causes its deformation. These are forcesthat may bring alteration to rock layers or the change in its formation in theEarth's surface.In geologic time, it covers the whole sweep of Earth's history, from how and whenthe earth was first formed, to everything that has happened on, in, and to theentire planet up to now.In this module, descriptions, characteristics, and behaviour of rock layers will bediscussed. Relevant information will be given which serves as a guide as you gothrough with the lesson in the formation of rock layers.​</h2><br />

What will be your stand?3.Plants use the energy from sunlight to turn carbon dioxide (present in air) and water into sugar for food. This process is called photosynthesis. The green color of the leaves, called chlorophyll. It helps them to make food for the plant.4. The continuous changing of air around us is called weather. Wind, rain, and snow are the different forms of changes taken by weather. The lives of people are influenced by these changes. Many people are forced to stay in their houses when it rains or snow. Weather likewise influences individual’s choice of clothes. When the weather is hot and thick, one wears light clothes, tight when it is cold.”5.The Earth is composed of different layers. The first layer is the crust, it is very thin in comparison to the other three layers. The crust is only about 3 – 5 miles thick under the oceans and about 25 miles thick under the continents. The next is the mantle which is located directly under the sima. It is 1800 miles thick and the largest layer of the Earth. It is composed of very hot, dense rock. The outer core is like a ball of very hot metals. It is located about 1800 miles beneath the crust and is about 1400 miles thick. It is composed of melted metals, nickel and iron. Finally, the inner core has temperatures and pressures so great that the metals are squeezed together and are not able to move about like a liquid, but are forced to vibrate in place as a solid. It begins about 4000 miles beneath the crust and is about 800 miles thick. All in all, there are four layers of the Earth.”PATULONG PO THANK YOU!...​</h2><br />

Water, ice, acids, salts, plants, animals, and temperature variations are some of the weathering agents. Following the breakdown of a rock, erosion is the process that removes the mineral and rock shards.</p><p></p><p>By coming into touch with water, gases in the atmosphere, and living things, rocks, soils, minerals, wood, and artificial objects all deteriorate through <strong>weathering</strong>.</p><p></p><p>The degradation of rocks close to the surface of the Earth brought on by precipitation, temperature changes, and biological activity is known as <strong>weathering</strong>. It does not include clearing away rubbish linked to rocks. There are three distinct types of weathering: physical, chemical, and biological.</p><p></p><p>Rocks and minerals undergo <strong>weathering </strong>when they are broken down by the wind, water, ice, and heat. In order to produce the many various types of landforms found on the surface of the earth, weathering is a crucial process. For instance, weathering is what creates caves, canyons, and mountains.</p><p></p><p>The atmosphere, water, and plant and animal life are what cause <strong>weathering </strong>most often. Rock's surface minerals are dissolved and made more brittle by weathering so that erosive forces like water, wind, and ice can carry them away. Weathering can be either mechanical or chemical.</p><p></p><p>To learn more about weathering, just click the link below:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/7049867</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/2600914</p><p></p><p>#SPJ2</p><br />
