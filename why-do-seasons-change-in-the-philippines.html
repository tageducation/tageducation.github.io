Throughout the year, different parts of Earth receive the Sun's most <strong>direct rays</strong>.

And when the South Pole tilts toward the Sun, it's winter in the Northern Hemisphere. </p><p></p><p>2.

                        <p><strong>Answer </strong><strong>:</strong><strong> </strong><strong>B</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Explanation</strong><strong>:</strong></p><p><strong> </strong><strong>The tilt of the earth changes every season causing places to change the position of the sun in the sky and the lengths of days.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>The tilt of the earth does not change at all. Its orientation changes as it revolves around the earth causing places to become closer or farther from the sun which is the reason for seasons.</strong></p><p></p><br />
