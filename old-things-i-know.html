                                            A museum is a place where we keep in safe custody the valuable and historic things of the past.These things tell us how our forefathers lived and worked.A museum is a very interesting place where we can see a collection of rare things and things of historical interest it is a house of all valuable and wonderful things.We study the old things there and we come to know much of our history and culture of bygone ages.We see all the things of past and present at one place.A visit to the museum is very inductive.Everyone wants to visit the museum because it is an education itself.Many people come from abroad to study past history of the past.this is just the answer for my ONLINE FRIENDS question so i hope it helps goodluck,godbless,keepsafe☺️​</a>

Days later the young man was proven innocent. After being released, the man felt humiliated as he walked to his home. He sued the old man for wrongly Accusing him.In court, the old man told the judge, "They were just comments, didn't Harm anyone..." The judge, before passing sentence on the case, told the man, "Write All the things you said about him on a piece of paper. Cut them up and On the way home, throw the pieces of paper out. Tomorrow, come back to Hear the sentence".The next day, the judge told the man, "Before receiving the Sentence, you will have to go out and gather all the pieces of paper that you threw yesterday". The old man said, "I can't do that! The wind must have spreads them and I won't know where to find them".The judge then replied, "The same way, simple comments may destroy the honor of aan to such an extent that one is not able to fix it". The old man realized hisistake and asked for forgiveness.1. What does this story remind you of?2. Does anything in this story remind you of anything in your own life?3.

                                            1. I’m so lost. I just moved to a new neighborhood and started in this school. All my old friends go to a different school. I don’t know anyone – who will I sit with at lunch? I don’t know anyone in my classes and whe n it is time to get into groups, the teacher selects my groups because no one knows me? I was in drama club in my old school, I don’t even know if this school has a drama club. I want to move back to my old house. It is too stressful to come to school here. What would be the best thing he or she can do?</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>   In the past, I often thought that in finishing an assigned task, outstanding individual capacity was what mattered the most. However, after undergoing work immersion and completing it, the belief which I closely held in my heart was shattered. I was completely wrong, because while undergoing in my work immersion I fully realized the meaning behind the saying ‘No man is an island’. Therefore, after a thorough reflection, I fully acknowledge the mistake that I made and took the initiative in learning how to effectively work as a part of a team. Team work really does dream work, because through the collaboration of many, micro efforts will absolutely produce macro results.</p><p></p><p>RELATED LINK;</p>https://brainly.ph/question/2155222<p><strong>#BRAINLYFAST</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            19. Choose Your Words WiselyOnce upon a time, an old man spread rumors that his neighbor was a thief. As a result, the young man was arrested. Days later the young man was proven innocent. After being released, the man felt humiliated as he walked to his home. He sued the old man for wrongly Accusing him.In court, the old man told the judge, "They were just comments, didn't Harm anyone..." The judge, before passing sentence on the case, told the man, "Write All the things you said about him on a piece of paper. Cut them up and On the way home, throw the pieces of paper out. Tomorrow, come back to Hear the sentence".The next day, the judge told the man, "Before receiving the Sentence, you will have to go out and gather all the pieces of paper that you threw yesterday". The old man said, "I can't do that! The wind must have spreads them and I won't know where to find them".The judge then replied, "The same way, simple comments may destroy the honor of aan to such an extent that one is not able to fix it". The old man realized hisistake and asked for forgiveness.1. What does this story remind you of?2. Does anything in this story remind you of anything in your own life?3.
