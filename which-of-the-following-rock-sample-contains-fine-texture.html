                        What is another term for landslide?<p></p><p><strong>Landslides</strong>, also known as landslips, are a variety of ground movements that can include rockfalls, deep-seated slope failures, mudflows, and debris flows. <strong>Landslides </strong>can occur in a variety of environments, characterized by either steep or gentle slope gradients, from mountain ranges to coastal cliffs, or even underwater, in which case they are known as submarine <strong>landslides</strong>. A <strong>landslide </strong>is primarily caused by gravity, but there are additional elements that alter slope stability and establish certain conditions that render a slope vulnerable to failure. A specific event (such as an earthquake, a slope cut to build a road, and many others) often triggers a <strong>landslide</strong>, though this is not always obvious. A <strong>landslide </strong>occurs when a mass of dirt or rock falls from a mountain or cliff.</p><p></p><p>What are the two types of landslides?</p><p>brainly.ph/question/7169636</p><p>#LETSSTUDY</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        METAMORPHISM
<p><strong>Metamorphism</strong> is from the word “meta” and “morphe” meaning “change” and “form”, respectively. In other words, <strong>metamorphism</strong> can be literally translated to “change of form”. <strong>Metamorphism</strong> is the change or transformation of rocks or minerals under various factors. <strong>Metamorphism</strong> is affected by factors like heat, reactive fluids, and pressure.
</p><p>
</p><p>Here are some facts about metamorphism.
</p><strong>D</strong>. Weathering is not a concept under metamorphosis.
<strong>C</strong>.  Pressure and heat cause a grain size to become course with the increasing change in depth.
<strong>C</strong>.  Water is the main factor of regional metamorphism.
<strong>B</strong>. The hornfels is a fine texture rock sample.
<strong>C</strong>. The metamorphism of sandstones results in marble.
<strong>B</strong>. Contact metamorphism is greatly affected by heat and reactive fluid factors.
<strong>A</strong>. Hornfels have fine or grain size texture.
<strong>D</strong>. Slate is influenced minimally by heat.
<strong>C</strong>. Pressure is not the main factor of contact metamorphism.
<strong>A</strong>. When heat is added, the grain size also increases in minerals.
<strong>A</strong>. Dolomite is different from feldspar, mica, and quartz.
<strong>A</strong>. Recrystallization and pressure are what cause lineation to deformed rocks.
<strong>C</strong>. Non-foliated is not connected with phyllite.
<strong>B</strong>. Pressure and temperature affect the rock depth and, as a whole, metamorphism.
<strong>B</strong>. Grain size is the best characteristic to evaluate under a magnifying glass.

                            19. Extrusive igneous rocks forms from lava that cools on the Earth’s surface. Because of this, the cooling process is faster producing fine-grained texture of igneous rocks. true or false? ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer And Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong>The following statement, "An intrusive igneous rock is fine-grained and forms when lava cools and solidifies" is b) False. An intrusive igneous rock is a coarse-grained rock, which forms as a result of the slow cooling of magma (molten rock) underneath the crust of the earth. Because this type of magma cools so slowly, it allows the grains and crystals to grow in size. It is extrusive igneous rock that is fine-grained, as a result of faster cooling. Extrusive igneous rock cools outside of the earth, when lava erupts. When the lava hits the air, the temperature difference is so great that the lava cools very quickly. This doesn't allow for the slow growth of grains and crystals within the rock, and it is therefore fine-grained. An example of intrusive igneous rock is granite, and an example of extrusive igneous rock is obsidian.</strong></p><br />
