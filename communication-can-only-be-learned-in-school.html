                        <p>I disagree that communication can only be learnt at school. Basically, children learnes the aspect of communicatio when we are still young. If one may remember the helical model of communication, stages from birth to childhood are important components or crucial time for a child for experiences are already gathered at this stage. Moreover, home is also a good exposure for children esepeciall if they have a nurturing environment were postcards of letters are in there. Thus, I can say that communication is not exactly firstly learne din school instead at home. It is olny at school that we learne dto develop and improve our communication skills.</p><br />

                        Because school is a place meant for learning, although not really the only place to learn communication, it is a big factor for the learning. Because a school will expose you to various types of people with various types of personalities that will enable you to learn and manage the different approaches you will make with that type of person. <br />

It addresses questions such as the current status of student interactions, the students' perceptions of such interactions, and the pattern emerged from such interaction behaviors. Using a phenomenological method, this study found out that the student interaction phenomenon in distance education was intertwined with many factors and themes. In order to foster an interactive learning community and encourage student interactions, all of the administrators, faculty, and staff in a distance education program need to collaborate with each other at an institutional level.</p><p></p><p></p><p>I'm not sure but I hope it's help </p><p>pa brainlist or pa follow pi. </p><p><strong>#CARRYONLEARNING</strong><strong> </strong></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Dear Teacher,</p><p>I have learned that vocabulary is one of the most important factors that will keep learners like me from communication breakdown. The strategies you have taught me help me a lot in avoiding this to happen again and again. Knowing how to overcome communication breakdown is very useful to me in the house. I can now confidently tell my parents the problems I have in my studies and I can now express my feelings towards things and towards them. In school, I can now confidently raise my hand to answer questions.  I I discovered that it is fun to talk with the neighbors and I learn things aside from what I learned in school.  I also joined community voluntary service like planting trees and cleaning our church. I could say that I have started to overcome my communication breakdown and I plan to continue it in the future.</p><p>Thankfully yours,</p><p>(your name)</p><p></p><br />
