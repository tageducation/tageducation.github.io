Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy.use your conditionals in your answer." Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice. Now is the time to lift our nation from the quicksand of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood. "1. If social injustice had not existed, what would probably the experiences of his people? 2. What could possibly happen if their efforts to achieve democracy would generate physical violence in the process?" I say to you today, my friends, though, even though we face the difficulties of to- day and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the Ameri- can dream. I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up, live out the true meaning of its creed. "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal." 3. If you were given the chance to talk to King after his speech, what would you tell or ask him? 4. If you were King, would you dream the same thing for your country? Why or why not?" When we allow freedom ring - when we let it ring from every city and every ham- let, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of God's children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, we will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual,Free at last! Free at last! Great God Almighty, We are free at last! " 5. For King, how does it feel to be free from discrimination and injustices? 6.

                        The African-American community would be able to exercise their rights and live lives that are not under discrimination and threat. They would be able to contribute greater to society because they are not being inhibited by hate and stigma from the community. The<strong> African - American culture </strong>would have an earlier role in shaping the American countryThen Dr. Kng’s speeches would have been considered a failure, because Dr. King <strong>envisioned</strong> a future where there are no prejudices, not only towards his own race but to all races. If this would result in violence then everything that he would have fought for would be for naught because enacting violence in the name of freedom would only further the cycle of hate that he wished to stop.I would like to ask him how he was able to do it to forego violence in exchange for a better way, a peaceful way of demonstration. I would ask him for advice and how he was able to be brave and stand up for what is right. I would ask for stories to inspire me and motivate me to become a better person in a world that is broken and hated. Given the chance and the background, yes I would dream the same dream. Knowing what the African - American community has been through and currently going thru, I think I would also dream of a better country for my people and all the other people residing in our country. I would dream of a society no longer gripped and overcome with hate and prejudice but a country of inclusion and equity. It would have been freeing both in mind, body, and spirit, knowing that something that his ancestors fought for and suffered for has finally come to fruition it would have been an unreal and freeing moment for him The is nothing more powerful than a united society with respect and care for each other.

He enjoys the support of 85% of Filipinos nationwide and he drove the point home in his State of the Nation Address where before he leave he told everybody about 1.) the economy that is doing well and being thanked  to the economic team that has also been able to push for good economic reforms; 2.) the Build, Build, Build infrastructure program that is moving forward with government spending reportedly up to 5% of GDP, a level that I think can be sustained through 2022; 3.) lastly, the economic growth at 6% to 6.5% over the next three years is resilient but will be hard to sustain if higher than that; and 4.) and about the political side… well, we don’t really know… the genius of the man is in keeping everybody guessing.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />
