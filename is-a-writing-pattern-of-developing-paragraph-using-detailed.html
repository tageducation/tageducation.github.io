                                            ACTIVITY Determine the patterns of development in writing that is being described in each item. 1. This pattern tells a story of an event or an experience. You relate a sequence of events which reveals something of importance (your main point), and all other important events of your story (your supporting details) to bring it to life with a detailed account of what happened. 2. Painting a word picture of person, place, animal or thing through sensory details to create a clear and vivid impression of the topic. 3. Tells what a word means to have a clear understanding of any word especially technical words, slang and specialized words used in the paragraph. 4. It involves sorting of items (people, things, ideas) into categories. Chronological, Spatial and Climatic orders may be used for this type of paragraph. 5. In this pattern of paragraph development it can either just point out the similarities or differences, or it can tackle either using subject-by-subject comparison (block pattern) or point-by-point comparison. 6. This pattern is followed to help your readers understand why something happened or is happening, and how one thing affects something else. A cause is what made an event or particular thing happen while effect is what happens as a result of the event. 7. It identifies a problem and proposes solutions, and persuades your readers that the problem has to be addressed. 8. The pattern of paragraph development that tries to convince the reader that a particular point of view is worthy of consideration. It wants you to consider both sides of an issue, but it reveals a bias favor of one side over another.​</a>

                                            ACTIVITY Determine the patterns of development in writing that is being described in each item. 1. This pattern tells a story of an event or an experience. You relate a sequence of events which reveals something of importance (your main point), and all other important events of your story (your supporting details) to bring it to life with a detailed account of what happened. 2. Painting a word picture of person, place, animal or thing through sensory details to create a clear and vivid impression of the topic. 3. Tells what a word means to have a clear understanding of any word especially technical words, slang and specialized words used in the paragraph. 4. It involves sorting of items (people, things, ideas) into categories. Chronological, Spatial and Climatic orders may be used for this type of paragraph. 5. In this pattern of paragraph development it can either just point out the similarities or differences, or it can tackle either using subject-by-subject comparison (block pattern) or point-by-point comparison. 6. This pattern is followed to help your readers understand why something happened or is happening, and how one thing affects something else. A cause is what made an event or particular thing happen while effect is what happens as a result of the event. 7. It identifies a problem and proposes solutions, and persuades your readers that the problem has to be addressed. 8. The pattern of paragraph development that tries to convince the reader that a particular point of view is worthy of consideration. It wants you to consider both sides of an issue, but it reveals a bias in favor of one side over another.​</a>
