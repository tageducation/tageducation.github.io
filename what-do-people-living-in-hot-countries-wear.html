                            8. What do people living in hot countries wear?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>People in hot countries stay cool by wearing light-colored clothing</strong> and living in white-painted homes. Since white is a good reflector and therefore a bad absorber of radiant heat, this decreases the amount of heat consumed. In cold areas, on the other hand, black cloths and dark colored clothing and furnishings are favored.  </p><p>The absorption of solar energy is directly proportional to the color of skin. This is why, in hotter temperatures, people choose lighter-colored clothing. Wearing darker colors causes you to get colder more quickly, while wearing lighter colors allows you to remain cooler for longer.  </p><p>Houses are another example of the same principle. Houses in hotter climates are frequently white or light-colored. In a warm climate, you can hardly see a dark home. This is because the house can trap the sun's heat, making the interior very hot.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. In hot countries people keep cold by wearing light colored cloths and in white painted house. This reduces the amount of heat absorbed, because white is a good reflector and therefore a poor absorber of radiant heat. On the other hand, black cloths and dark colored clothes and house are preferred in the cold countries.</p><p></p><p>2.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.In hot countries people keep cold by wearing light colored cloths and in white painted house. This reduces the amount of heat absorbed, because white is a good reflector and therefore a poor absorber of radiant heat.</p><p></p><p>You may look for dresses, tops, and skirts made of cotton or linen. Or you may opt for a jersey dress in a simple cut that you can wear on a hot day. Shorts made of cotton or linen are also good options for staying cool on a hot day. T-shirts and collared shirts made of linen or jersey are also ideal.</p><p></p><p>2.Wear several layers of loose fitting, lightweight, warm clothing rather than one layer of heavy clothing. The outer garments should be tightly woven and water repellent. Wear mittens, which are warmer than gloves.</p><p></p><p>3.A. No, because climate is the weather, averaged over multiple decades. Aggregate changes in the weather that sustain long enough to form a trend = climate change. JMA have released their global temperature data for December. I made a gif of the monthly temperature anomalies.</p><p></p><p>B.</p><p>Yes, Because Climate has a big impact on the lives of the people in an area because it is based on their livelihoods especially the farmers and fishermen of our countrymen because of the weather or climate they base their livelihood on. Here in the Philippines we have two climates the rainy season and summer.</p><p></p><p>4.Some people choose to live in vibrant city centres, some in leafy suburbs, and others in quiet villages. These choices are the result of a complex set of decisions, trade-offs, preferences and priorities influenced by their age, and by the attributes and amenities that the different parts of a city offer.</p><p></p><p>Where The feeling of community can be hugely beneficial when it comes to settling in quickly. As we outlined above, city life is busy, hectic and can be stressful. Rural neighbourhoods are generally safer, with lower crime rates, as well as experiencing fewer problems with traffic and fewer people on public transport.</p><br />
