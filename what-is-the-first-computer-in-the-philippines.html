                        <p>The first computer in the philippines is in the first generation (<strong>1940-1959</strong>), during World War II.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>EXPLANATION:</strong></p><p>When World War II took place, the countries involved tried to <strong>develop</strong> computers to <strong>exploit</strong> the potential of computers. In 1941, a German engineer, Conrad Zuse, created a computer called Z3, which serves to design an airplane and missiles. Two years later, in 1943, England succeeded in completing a secret code-breaking computer called the Colossus Computer. The Colossus computer functioned to decode a secret code that was then used by Nazi Germany.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the existence of the Colossus computer did <strong>not really affect</strong> computer development, because Colossus was not a versatile computer, but was only designed to decode a secret code. The <strong>first</strong> computer from the <strong>Philippines</strong> began to appear in <strong>1946</strong>, which is called the first generation of computers. The first generation of computers was created using vacuum tubes as a basic component of manufacture. These vacuum tubes are known to be inefficient in several aspects because they get hot very easily when in use.</p><p></p><p>This is caused by the vacuum tube which requires very large electrical power to operate. One example of the first generation of computers or also called the first computer in the world is the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer (<strong>ENIAC</strong>).</p><p></p><p>Learn more about <strong>super computers, mainframe computers, mini computers and mobile computers:</strong></p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/19180290</p><p></p><p>#SPJ2</p><br />

                            18. 1. There are 205 lions and 300 tigers in a savanna, which has a carrying capacity of 1300. The lion has a biotic potential of 1.5, while the tiger has a biotic potential of 0.5. Assuming that both populations follow the logistic growth pattern, which one will grow faster? Prove your answer using computations.2. The population of monkeys in a tropical forest were recorded for two consecutive years.

                        <p>The first computer virus in the Philippines was ILOVEYOU.</p><p></p><p><strong>More detailed explanation:</strong></p><p><strong>A computer virus </strong>is a computer program that can replicate or copy itself and spread by inserting itself into other programs or documents. Computer viruses according to the biology of viruses that spread embedded in living cells. Computer viruses can be destructive (such as corrupting data in documents) can be annoying to computer users, or have no effect at all.</p><p>The ILOVEYOU virus was <strong>first detected on May 4, 2000</strong>. Onel de Guzman and Reomel Ramones are Filipinos, the brains of this shocking virus. In early 2000, the ILoveYou virus attacked 45 million people in just one day. In addition, ILoveYou caused losses of up to $5.5 billion. This is an impressive amount of damage caused by the virus. This virus is spread via email with the subject ILOVE YOU and followed by the attachment Love-Letter-For-You.TXT.vbs. When the user opens the <strong>"ILOVEYOU" link</strong>, the virus automatically attacks JPEG, MP3, and other data receiving formats. Messages are also sent directly to all Microsoft Outlook recipient contacts.</p><p>In fact, at that time Microsoft Outlook was being used by companies all over the world, so it is undeniable that this virus spread quickly. Worse, all information about e-mail taken from the computer's address book, such as usernames and passwords will be sent to the address of the author of the virus.  </p><p>Before the ILOVEYOU virus, there was the <strong>Melissa virus</strong> to be precise in 1999. The Melissa Virus attacked through documents sent via email. Messages like "This is the document you requested, don't show it to anyone else." Once the link is activated this virus will replicate itself automatically and send the same message to 50 recipients' email contacts. But this virus is not made by Filipinos.</p><p></p><p>More information about computer viruses can follow the link below:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/8303034  </p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/1859413 </p><p>#SPJ2</p><br />
