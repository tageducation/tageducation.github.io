Our lives should be guided by the lesson's message that we should never let everything that Jesus Christ has suffered and given up for us to go to waste. If we know we are fighting for the right thing, we should not be afraid to step up and fight for what we believe in. Finally, never let someone walk on you or treat you like a slave because he fought for us and as a result, we should never again be shackled or chained by the ropes or other structures that previously kept us in place.</p><p>2. It is a massive help because I have completely understood that we are having freedom because Christ himself gave his life so that we would not have to go through the tremendous sufferings that they have gone through helped me in being a more positive person in my life. We should be grateful for what God has created and sacrificed for us as a result.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Pa brainliest po</p><br />

7. The security alarm on a parked car goes off and produces a frequency of 960 Hz. The speed of sound is 343 m/s. As you drive toward this parked car, pass it, and drive away, you observe the frequency to change by 95 Hz. At what speed are you driving? 
8. Suppose you are stopped at a traffic light, and an ambulance approaches you from behind with a speed of 18 m/s. the siren on the ambulance produces sound with a frequency of 955 Hz. The speed of sound I air is 343 m/s. What is the wavelength of the sound reaching your ears?
9. A speeder looks in his rearview mirror. He notices that a police car has pulled behind him and is matching his speed of 38 m/s. The siren on the police car has a frequency of 860 Hz when the police car and the listener are stationary. The speed of sound is 343 m/s. What frequency does the speeder hear when the siren is turned on in the moving police car?
10. A bird is flying directly toward a stationary bird-watcher and emits a frequency of 1250 Hz. The bird-watcher, however, hears a frequency of 1290 Hz. What is the speed of the bird, expressed as a percentage of the speed of sound
