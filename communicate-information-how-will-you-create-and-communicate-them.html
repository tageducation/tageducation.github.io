                                            ACTIVITY 2: WHATCHA SAY? There are eight common types of diction as discussed by Master Class (2019). Let us see if you can identify all of them based on the given definition and description below. The word is already revealed but you have to rearrange the letters to get the correct answer. Sounds easy? Give it a try! 1. FAMORL This type of diction refers to the use of sophisticated language, without slang or colloquialisms. It sticks to grammatical rules and uses complicated syntax—the structure of sentences. 2. IFRONMAL It is more conversational and often used in narrative literature. This casual vernacular is representative of how people communicate in real life, which gives an author freedom to depict more realistic characters. Most short stories and novels use this type of diction. 3. PEDNATIC This is when a writer is highly detailed or academic in their writing. Words are chosen specifically to convey only one meaning. It is sometimes used in literature when characters speak in a highly educated manner, as in F. Scott Fitzgerald’s The Great Gatsby. 4. COLLOQUAIL These words or expressions are informal in nature and generally represent a certain region or time. “Ain’t” and “y’all” are examples of expressions for people born in rural areas of the United States. This type of diction adds color and realism to writing. 5. SALNG These are words that originated within a specific culture or subgroup but gained traction. It can be a new word, a shortened or modified word, or words that take on a new meaning. Examples of these are “hip,” which means trendy; and “throw shade,” which is to lob an insult at someone. 6. ASBTARCT This is when a writer uses words to express something intangible, like an idea or an emotion. The phrases used often lack physical detail and specificity because they are things the reader cannot experience through their five senses. 7. CNOCRETE This diction refers to the use of words for their literal meanings and often refer to things that appeal to the senses. The meaning is not open to interpretation because the writer is specific and detailed in their phrasing. For example, the sentence: “I ate an apple.” 8. POEITC This is driven by lyrical words that relate to a specific theme reflected in a poem, and create a euphonious, or harmonious, sound. It usually involves the u​</a>

                                            You are in the fourth month of the project and several issues have arisen. Christian, from Code Corp. said that their initial labor estimate was too low because you did not provide complete specifications or mention their involvement in the final customer testing. Everyone thought that the remote capture application would be easy to develop, but now Code Corp. increased its cost estimate by $100,000. John, the purchasing specialist, does not like the main scanner supplier selected and went straight to the project sponsor to voice his opposition. He said that recent negative press against that company would not sit well with many of the bank’s conservative customers. You know that by changing the main scanner hardware, Code Corp. would have to do even more coding, increasing the cost again. Mike, one of the information technology specialists, came and told you that he feels overwhelmed on the project and doesn’t understand all the work the suppliers are doing. As project manager, you have been getting short, weekly status reports from all of your team members and suppliers, but many of them did not address challenges people are obviously facing.  Tasks1.     Create an issue log for the project. List at least three issues and related information based on the scenario presented.2.     In addition to written weekly status reports, what else might you suggest to improve project communications? 3. Write a one- to two-page paper describing how you might approach two of the conflicts described above. Explain the conflict-handling mode you are suggesting and why you think it would work.​</a>

                            10. ACTIVITY 2: WHATCHA SAY? There are eight common types of diction as discussed by Master Class (2019). Let us see if you can identify all of them based on the given definition and description below. The word is already revealed but you have to rearrange the letters to get the correct answer. Sounds easy? Give it a try! 1. FAMORL This type of diction refers to the use of sophisticated language, without slang or colloquialisms. It sticks to grammatical rules and uses complicated syntax—the structure of sentences. 2. IFRONMAL It is more conversational and often used in narrative literature. This casual vernacular is representative of how people communicate in real life, which gives an author freedom to depict more realistic characters. Most short stories and novels use this type of diction. 3. PEDNATIC This is when a writer is highly detailed or academic in their writing. Words are chosen specifically to convey only one meaning. It is sometimes used in literature when characters speak in a highly educated manner, as in F. Scott Fitzgerald’s The Great Gatsby. 4. COLLOQUAIL These words or expressions are informal in nature and generally represent a certain region or time. “Ain’t” and “y’all” are examples of expressions for people born in rural areas of the United States. This type of diction adds color and realism to writing. 5. SALNG These are words that originated within a specific culture or subgroup but gained traction. It can be a new word, a shortened or modified word, or words that take on a new meaning. Examples of these are “hip,” which means trendy; and “throw shade,” which is to lob an insult at someone. 6. ASBTARCT This is when a writer uses words to express something intangible, like an idea or an emotion. The phrases used often lack physical detail and specificity because they are things the reader cannot experience through their five senses. 7. CNOCRETE This diction refers to the use of words for their literal meanings and often refer to things that appeal to the senses. The meaning is not open to interpretation because the writer is specific and detailed in their phrasing. For example, the sentence: “I ate an apple.” 8. POEITC This is driven by lyrical words that relate to a specific theme reflected in a poem, and create a euphonious, or harmonious, sound. It usually involves the u​</h2><br />

                            11. You are in the fourth month of the project and several issues have arisen. Christian, from Code Corp. said that their initial labor estimate was too low because you did not provide complete specifications or mention their involvement in the final customer testing. Everyone thought that the remote capture application would be easy to develop, but now Code Corp. increased its cost estimate by $100,000. John, the purchasing specialist, does not like the main scanner supplier selected and went straight to the project sponsor to voice his opposition. He said that recent negative press against that company would not sit well with many of the bank’s conservative customers. You know that by changing the main scanner hardware, Code Corp. would have to do even more coding, increasing the cost again. Mike, one of the information technology specialists, came and told you that he feels overwhelmed on the project and doesn’t understand all the work the suppliers are doing. As project manager, you have been getting short, weekly status reports from all of your team members and suppliers, but many of them did not address challenges people are obviously facing.  Tasks1.     Create an issue log for the project. List at least three issues and related information based on the scenario presented.2.     In addition to written weekly status reports, what else might you suggest to improve project communications? 3. Write a one- to two-page paper describing how you might approach two of the conflicts described above. Explain the conflict-handling mode you are suggesting and why you think it would work.​</h2><br />
