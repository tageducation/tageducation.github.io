                                            Over the past couple of days, I thought long and hard about this question. What does itmean to be Filipino?2 I was born to Filipino parents, raised in Manila and was as “pure” as a Filipino can get;short, morena and a nose just between pointed and flat (because I refuse to accept that Pinoysare pango; we are not). Though from time to time, my mother would bring up her lola was “pure”Spanish and that we had European blood running through our veins, albeit a drop. But I did notthink it mattered, she was after all saying this to a six- or seven-year-old me. It did not matteruntil I was in first grade and the girl I sat next to in class, fair-skinned, ash brown hair with eyesthat disappeared when she smiled, told me she did not want to play with me because my skinlooked “dirty.” 3 I never forgot that. So, whenever I could, I would casually bring up to friends that I wasone fourth or part Spanish. But no one believed me because my features were far from whatanyone would call mestiza.4 For a time, I thought papaya soap would brighten my skin and outlook. Obviously, itdidn’t and was told instead that, like this girl from school who pursued showbiz, I’d need tobleach my skin to get “more opportunities.” My mother would never approve so I resigned to therole given to me: the short morena one.5 I turned my attention to extracurriculars and school (yes, in that order). I learned aboutFilipino history, our heroes, how the Spanish and Japanese raped our country and our women,how the Americans “democratically” took advantage of our naïveté. I memorized the names of thepresidents we’ve had, went on poverty immersions, tutored children from public schools, visitedpolitical prisoners. We watched films that showed us what happened during Martial Law, towhich mom and dad each had their own take on what “really” happened. People Power overthrewthe Marcos administration two decades later and the first female president, Cory Aquino,restored democracy. No one thought another revolution would happen until former presidentJoseph Estrada took office. The action star turned politician would later be removed from his seatof power three days after a peaceful protest and Estrada was found guilty of plunder. “Order” wasrestored.6 Experiencing life in a middle-class Filipino household and learning about our history,however, didn’t fill me with a sense of patriotism or pride. Not when opportunities are based onhow fair the color of your skin is, as if lighter is an indication of better quality. My eyes don’tbrim or fill with tears when I watch historical movies or even the news because too often, they aremelodramatic. Meanwhile, the qualifications we have set for our leaders are far too inadequate,“natural born Filipino; a registered voter; must be able to read and write; 40 years of age at theday of the election.” Elections are won based on popularity, catchy campaign jingles and howmany votes one’s funding can afford.7 Too many times I’ve cringed as the media too quickly associates Pinoy Pride with aperson of influence or power who has an ounce of Filipino blood in him or her but has not oncebeen to the Philippines or know anything about his or her Filipino heritage. It takes validationfrom the West for us to recognize and laud our own—our own born, raised, educated, and trainedhere at home. We are prejudiced against our own brothers and sisters across the archipelago, wecall them names. We call other ethnicities derogatory names “jokingly,” too. Ironically, we areoutraged when our people and culture are depicted in the media inaccurately.8 Do I hate being Filipino? No, hate is a strong word. Do I wish I were born to non-Filipinoparents, not at all. I respect my heritage and the land I grew up in. I respect the wealth of naturalresources we have through responsible tourism and travel. I pay taxes and I do not break thelaw. I respect the brilliant minds working towards positive change whether here or on a globalscale and support their advocacies. But until we cease being slaves to awa or emotions, until westop eschewing education and logic, until the parlor tricks of local politics lose its appeal amongthe masses, until we do our part, and the administration does theirs, until we’ve fully, completelyembraced that brown is a great color…all we have are pieces of our glorious past. And perhapsyan po ung story sariling opinion daw po eto people ung questions1.The Philippine history is a story of a glorious past.2 News and historical movies in the Philippines are often melodramatic.3. The Philippine media too quickly associates Pinoy Pride with a person of influenceor power who has an ounce of Filipino blood in him or her but has not once beento the Philippines or know anything about his or her Filipino heritage4.Filipinos have low standards in choosing leaders. 5.The masses are easily tricked by politicians.6.Filipinos’ brown skin is great​</a>

Statistics show that inStates with capital punishment, murder rates are the same or almost the same as instates without capital punishment. It is also true that it is more expensive to put aperson on death row than in life imprisonment because of the costs of maximumsecurity. Unfortunately, capital punishment has been used unjustly. Statistics showthat every execution is of a man and that nine out of ten are black. So prejudiceshows right through2. Sunday is my favorite day of the week. I like it because on Sunday, I watch footballOn the other days, I also get to watch football but not all day. There are other sportson other days to watch on TV. Sunday lunch is a favorite of mine because I eat withmy father in front of the TV. Some days my dad doesn't make it home from workuntil after I'm in bed. Some weeks my dad travels, and I don't see him for severaldays. The highlight of the day is when we watch the Dolphins play Dad and I get soexcited, we yell and cheer together. The thing that I like to do best in the world iswatch TV with my dad.3. in Alice Walker's "To Hell with Dying," Mr. Sweet was a good companion for thenarrator and her siblings. Mr. Sweet always made the narrator feel special. Sheloved to be around him and was overjoyed whenever he would visit her. Mr Sweetplayed with the children just as if he were a child himself. Mr. Sweet also displayed agreat deal of respect for the narrator and her family. Even though his alcoholism andlifestyle was a bad influence on the children, his virtues far outweighed his faults. MrSweet had a positive impact on the children that would last their entire lives. He wascompassionate, caring and honest, and the children learned to respect themselvesand others form their experiences with Mr. Sweet. He also inspired the children tosucceed. Mr. Sweet's lifestyle did not make him an excellent role model for thechildren, but he was always an excellent companion.The motive of the fictional autobiographers of Charlotte Bronte's novels must havebeen to "sum" and existence, "bound" a life, and find safety in the "strait limits" of anenclosed mind. Because all three autobiographers, William Crimsworth, Jane Eyreand Lucy Snowe, seem to need oversimplify both their own natures and the worldsin which they live in. They are all different, however, they go and do it in basically thesame way! Repressing what her more instinctual impulses tell her about the complextruths of experience, this is how they generate personal mythologies by which torationalize their lives.Club Palm Resort's isolation created dissatisfaction among some vacationers.

                            6. Over the past couple of days, I thought long and hard about this question. What does itmean to be Filipino?2 I was born to Filipino parents, raised in Manila and was as “pure” as a Filipino can get;short, morena and a nose just between pointed and flat (because I refuse to accept that Pinoysare pango; we are not). Though from time to time, my mother would bring up her lola was “pure”Spanish and that we had European blood running through our veins, albeit a drop. But I did notthink it mattered, she was after all saying this to a six- or seven-year-old me. It did not matteruntil I was in first grade and the girl I sat next to in class, fair-skinned, ash brown hair with eyesthat disappeared when she smiled, told me she did not want to play with me because my skinlooked “dirty.” 3 I never forgot that. So, whenever I could, I would casually bring up to friends that I wasone fourth or part Spanish. But no one believed me because my features were far from whatanyone would call mestiza.4 For a time, I thought papaya soap would brighten my skin and outlook. Obviously, itdidn’t and was told instead that, like this girl from school who pursued showbiz, I’d need tobleach my skin to get “more opportunities.” My mother would never approve so I resigned to therole given to me: the short morena one.5 I turned my attention to extracurriculars and school (yes, in that order). I learned aboutFilipino history, our heroes, how the Spanish and Japanese raped our country and our women,how the Americans “democratically” took advantage of our naïveté. I memorized the names of thepresidents we’ve had, went on poverty immersions, tutored children from public schools, visitedpolitical prisoners. We watched films that showed us what happened during Martial Law, towhich mom and dad each had their own take on what “really” happened. People Power overthrewthe Marcos administration two decades later and the first female president, Cory Aquino,restored democracy. No one thought another revolution would happen until former presidentJoseph Estrada took office. The action star turned politician would later be removed from his seatof power three days after a peaceful protest and Estrada was found guilty of plunder. “Order” wasrestored.6 Experiencing life in a middle-class Filipino household and learning about our history,however, didn’t fill me with a sense of patriotism or pride. Not when opportunities are based onhow fair the color of your skin is, as if lighter is an indication of better quality. My eyes don’tbrim or fill with tears when I watch historical movies or even the news because too often, they aremelodramatic. Meanwhile, the qualifications we have set for our leaders are far too inadequate,“natural born Filipino; a registered voter; must be able to read and write; 40 years of age at theday of the election.” Elections are won based on popularity, catchy campaign jingles and howmany votes one’s funding can afford.7 Too many times I’ve cringed as the media too quickly associates Pinoy Pride with aperson of influence or power who has an ounce of Filipino blood in him or her but has not oncebeen to the Philippines or know anything about his or her Filipino heritage. It takes validationfrom the West for us to recognize and laud our own—our own born, raised, educated, and trainedhere at home. We are prejudiced against our own brothers and sisters across the archipelago, wecall them names. We call other ethnicities derogatory names “jokingly,” too. Ironically, we areoutraged when our people and culture are depicted in the media inaccurately.8 Do I hate being Filipino? No, hate is a strong word. Do I wish I were born to non-Filipinoparents, not at all. I respect my heritage and the land I grew up in. I respect the wealth of naturalresources we have through responsible tourism and travel. I pay taxes and I do not break thelaw. I respect the brilliant minds working towards positive change whether here or on a globalscale and support their advocacies. But until we cease being slaves to awa or emotions, until westop eschewing education and logic, until the parlor tricks of local politics lose its appeal amongthe masses, until we do our part, and the administration does theirs, until we’ve fully, completelyembraced that brown is a great color…all we have are pieces of our glorious past. And perhapsyan po ung story sariling opinion daw po eto people ung questions1.The Philippine history is a story of a glorious past.2 News and historical movies in the Philippines are often melodramatic.3.
