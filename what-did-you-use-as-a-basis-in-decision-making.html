My decisions are directly affected by what I have gone through or what I am going through right now. Each decision made by a person is directly related to his/her life or for the common good of all.People reflect on their own experiences when it comes to decision-making, therefore, as natural social creatures human beings are, the selfishness one has is the basis. If the decision does not affect anyone in a negative manner, thus, it is for the greater good.<br />

We are all humans yes but we are different from each other. We all have unique traits, distinct preference, and etc. We are not in the right place to criticize them. shaming them is like shaming a person who prefers a gradient color rather than plain ones. The best that we can do is to support and respect them for what they are.  But if you don't support them? It's fine, but at least respect them. Because It will cost you nothing to respect people. And I pick this stand bec this is for my friends who is in the Rainbow side and to those people whose part on LGBTQ COMMUNITY too.</p><br />
