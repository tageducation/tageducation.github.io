How can we use the advantages to make our lives better and how can we address the advantages?</h2><br />
                        ANSWER:<p>People media refers to media that is created and shared by individuals, rather than by professional journalists or media organizations. Some advantages of people media include increased diversity of voices and perspectives, and the ability for individuals to share their own experiences and stories. This can create a more inclusive and diverse public discourse, and give people the opportunity to share their unique perspectives and experiences.</p><p></p><p>Two disadvantages of people media are that it can be less reliable and trustworthy than professional media, and it can be more difficult to verify the accuracy of the information that is shared. This can lead to the spread of misinformation and false information, which can have negative consequences for individuals and society as a whole.</p><p></p><p>To make our lives better using the advantages of people media, we can use it to learn about different perspectives and experiences, and to engage with diverse voices. This can help us to better understand the world around us and to develop empathy and understanding for others. We can also use people media to share our own experiences and perspectives, and to connect with others who have similar interests and experiences.</p><p></p><p>To address the disadvantages of people media, we can take steps to verify the accuracy and reliability of the information that we encounter on social media and other platforms. This can involve checking multiple sources and using critical thinking skills to evaluate the credibility of the information. We can also support professional journalism and media organizations, which can provide more reliable and trustworthy information.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

Consumer health deals with the decisions people make regarding the purchase and the use of the available products.  3.A wise health consumer needs to distinguish the use of various products as well as their advantages and disadvantages. 4, Consumers depend on different sources for health facts. 5. Today, people are bombarded with conflicting information about various products and services brought by sophisticated advertisements and other media.​</h2><br />
                        Increasingly, consumers engage in health information seeking via the Internet. Taking a communication perspective, this review argues why public health professionals should be concerned about the topic, considers potential benefits, synthesizes quality concerns, identifies criteria for evaluating online health information and critiques the literature. More than 70 000 websites disseminate health information; in excess of 50 million people seek health information online, with likely consequences for the health care system. The Internet offers widespread access to health information, and the advantages of interactivity, information tailoring and anonymity. However, access is inequitable and use is hindered further by navigational challenges due to numerous design features (e.g. disorganization, technical language and lack of permanence). Increasingly, critics question the quality of online health information; limited research indicates that much is inaccurate. Meager information-evaluation skills add to consumers' vulnerability, and reinforce the need for quality standards and widespread criteria for evaluating health information. Extant literature can be characterized as speculative, comprised of basic `how to' presentations, with little empirical research. Future research needs to address the Internet as part of the larger health communication system and take advantage of incorporating extant communication concepts. Not only should research focus on the `net-gap' and information quality, it also should address the inherently communicative and transactional quality of Internet use. Both interpersonal and mass communication concepts open avenues for investigation and understanding the influence of the Internet on health beliefs and behaviors, health care, medical outcomes, and the health care system.<br />
