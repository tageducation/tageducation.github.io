Nike: Purpose Moves Us Our purpose is to unite the world through sports to create a healthy planet, active communities and an equal playing field for all. Nike packs power into one line: "Purpose moves us." Their revolving goal is a changing and moving effort to create an active planet. With their manifesto, Nike provides articles and inspiration on how the company is working to achieve their goals through their products. Source: es.yourdictionary.com Apple: To the Crazy Ones Here's to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. They're not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo. You can praise them, disagree with them, quote them, disbelieve them, glorify them or lify them. The only thing you can't do is ignore them because they change things. In this excerpt from their short ad manifesto, Apple demonstrates their commitment to people who think differently. They strive to push the status quo and invite imagination and creativity. This call to arms, so to speak, not only inspires but invites everyone to explore their thinking.

                                            B. Creating Your Own Survey Questionnaire Since the start of the community quarantine, it must have been challenging for you to keep in touch with your friends and classmates. With the health protocols in place that discourage any form of social gathering, you only have online as a means of knowing how they have been doing. With what you have learned today, let us get in touch with them and see how they have been doing by using a survey questionnaire that you're going to create. Directions: When creating your survey questionnaire, use these guide questions as your reference for the kind of statement or questions you will write. For each of these questions, supply five statements or questions that your classmates/friends (acting as respondents) will provide ratings. Use the space provided for your survey questionnaire. (20 points) Guide Questions: 1. How have your friends or classmates been doing since the start of modular distance learning? 2. What is the perception of your friends or classmates on modular distance learning?​</a>

Example: is not that an easy being an artist in your field. There were lots of frustration before you can create something in your own field. As an artist in my own field I could express my work of arts to the community by letting them see and critique my masterpiece. Let them try to explore and engage by giving them the opportunity to try it with themselves. Create a lecture for them to leam further knowledge and ideas that could make them grow as well. This is how I could express it to myself and to the community. Now it's your turn to answer.​</a>

this helps you to be honest with your family. Always support your family at all time especially in difficult times. Always share with your family to show your appreciation to them that you care about your family.

Source: es.yourdictionary.com Apple: To the Crazy Ones Here's to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. They're not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo. You can praise them, disagree with them, quote them, disbelieve them, glorify them or lify them. The only thing you can't do is ignore them because they change things. In this excerpt from their short ad manifesto, Apple demonstrates their commitment to people who think differently. They strive to push the status quo and invite imagination and creativity. This call to arms, so to speak, not only inspires but invites everyone to explore their thinking.
