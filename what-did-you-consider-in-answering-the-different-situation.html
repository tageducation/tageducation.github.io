1. What did you consider in answering the different situations?
2. Based on your answers, how did you face your differences with other people in the situations?
3. Is it easy to maintain a positive relationship with others despite differences? Why or Why not?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>We as humans have a nature of seeking validation from others. We often go out of ways just to meet and satisfy the minimum standards that we deem others projecting unto us.  It is usually okay to not try to be something when it is coherently impossible. Though there are cases when being in public that we must mind the odor that we emit. It is sometimes a moral decency. For example, eating garlic on a subway is considered being ignorant to the one sitting next to you because it gives off a nasty odor. Going back to the problem, if there is not that much water, we can depend on fruits that give off strong citrus acid concentration such as lemons, kalamansi etc. These fruits repel the odor by overpowering them.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>1. In answering the different situations, I considered not just myself, but others as well. I also considered the generally accepted moral truth in regards to situations.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>2. Based on my answers, I face my differences with other people sometimes by just accepting a certain problem when there isn't really much to do about it. But sometimes when there is a possible solution to the problem, then we try to do so.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>3. Maintaining a positive relationship with others basically depends on you and the person you are interacting with. If both parties could accept each other's short comings, then there will be a fruitful relation. However, if there is none, then there is no future for the mentioned relation. </strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>This took so much of my time lol. bye ill be having my meryenda now</p><br />

<p>
</p><p>
</p>I figured I was calm and carefully thought about problems about how I could handle them.<p>
</p>I just have to speak to them comfortably and welcome them. There is nothing wrong with the differences.
<p>
</p>Yes, and if you embrace these differences, you will appreciate them better.
<p><strong>Respect Uniqueness</strong>
</p><p>Being unique is something you should be proud of. Can you imagine if the people in your group had the same face? That will be a challenge to decide who you're interacting with. The individuality of each person, therefore, serves them to be remembered by others.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>If I am in this kind of situation, I will help my younger sister first with her school work before I will do my school requirements. Knowing my priorities in life help me decide in this situation. Priorities guide every individual to identify what’s important in their lives and what it needs to be done. In the situation mentioned, the family  is more important and that is my priority and commitment. Maybe I can explain the task to my sister guide her in doing the schoolwork while I’m doing my school task too. As a result, my sister and I finish our school assignments.</p><p></p><p>Ways to Set Priorities in Life</p><p>Here are some ways to set priorities in life:</p><p></p><p>Create a list of your priorities.</p><p>Sort necessary over non-necessary tasks.</p><p>Work one at a time to avoid overwhelming.</p><p>Compromise if necessary.</p><p>Determine the most productive days of your week.</p><p>Do the most difficult task first.</p><p>Planning is essential.</p><p>Prioritizing is a human skill that should be practiced and developed.</p><p>Set realistic goals in achieving priorities.</p><p>Clear distractions to focus on doing more important things.</p><p>Situation 2:</p><p>This situation made me feel that I need to talk to my parents about their plan to send me to a medical school as well as the need to hear from me that I want to become a fashion designer. I will wait for a better time and bring up this matter to my parents. I will not look into their intentions because I am sure that they only want the best for me. However, as an individual, I have my aspirations in life that I need to fulfill and I need to explain to my parents.</p><p></p><p>Chances of Getting a Yes</p><p>Here are some tips to communicate with parents and increase the chance of them to say Yes:</p><p></p><p>Be honest in expressing yourself and your intentions to your parents.</p><p>Right timing is the key. Approach parents when they are relaxed and when making decisions don’t’ pressure them to decide right away.</p><p>Give complete details of the topic that you want to talk about with them .</p><p>Display to your parents that you accept their decision and respect it. If they see that you are matured, maybe they will reconsider things.</p><p>Situation 3:</p><p>First, I will be grateful to my friend that she gives honest remarks to me. Then, I will explain that the water supply in our area is very limited and we have to be considerate in using the water with the family. I am confident that my friend will understand the reason for my unpleasant smell and will lend help to me with the situation. Maybe my friend will let me take a bath in their place so that I will have a clean body and a good smell.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Ikaw na mag sagot sa iba hehe</p>1.
