                        <p></p><p></p><p>1. START WITH THE BIG PICTURE.</p><p>I believe that starting is the hardest part. If you’re struggling in the initial steps of lesson planning, try taking a step back. Connect with other grade level teachers at your school to see how your year can fit into the bigger picture—like a curriculum calendar. From there, break it down to objective-based, shorter-term units. Within each unit, what do you want to accomplish? What do you want your students to know and be able to do by the end? With each lesson, outline a desired outcome or goal for you and your students to work towards.</p><p></p><p>2. DON’T RELY ON FLUFF.</p><p>Even after I’ve planned my lessons, I like to reassess my own strategies. I ask myself what I can improve or make more efficient. What are the structures or systems within my classroom that are working? How can I use these more? Rather than breaking your day into tiny little pieces, focus on the activities that provide richer opportunities for deep thinking. While Pinterest-inspired little activities may keep kids busy, they don’t always teach to the rigor and relevance that they need.</p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>you shouldn't understand it</p><p></p><br />
