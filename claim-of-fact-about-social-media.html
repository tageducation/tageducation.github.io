                                            Jane, who is now 19 years old, has lived with her grandparents since she was a month old. Her parents worked in Japan as overseas Filipino workers (OFWs). They do, however, keep in touch practically every day via social media. Her grandparents and parents describe her as a person who is picky about the friends with whom she forms tight bonds. Her grandparents saw that she chooses friends who share her characteristics and demonstrate the principles she espouses. She understands, however, that she cannot choose her family or the individuals with whom she will have to work in school and at her future workplace. Her pal describes her as a straightforward but discreet girl who is caring, fun to be around, insightful, and even filled with life's wisdom despite her young age. Her friends also noted that she respects her friends' individuality and treats them as equals, but always with the utmost respect. She does not take things subjectively, but rather objectively and based on facts, and she also researches. She is not judgmental and can connect with people from all walks of life. Her grandparents also noticed that the majority of her friends are 20 years older than she is. How would you characterize Jane's philosophical self? Back up your claim.​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>PARAGRAPH ABOUT SOCIAL MEDIA
</p><p>Now that we're in The Information Age, almost everyone has their social media accounts. It's really essential now especially now that we're in a pandemic. Social media helps us get informed on what is happening in the world today. It also helps us connect with our loved ones that are many miles away. Social media really helps us communicate with people easier than before! Though, social media has a lot of benefits, it has a lot of drawbacks as well since it's really inevitable. One drawback of social media is fake news. They are all over social media platforms and it fooled a lot of people. Everyone's probably been a victim of fake news. Because of this, the information age has become the disinformation age. Another drawback of social media is that it may lower the self-esteem of a person. People have a tendency to compare themselves to others and ask themselves questions such as "Why do I only have a few followers?", "Why do I only get a few likes", "Why does this person get a lot of attention when they post while I do not?". Social media may even lead people to depression.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Credits to the owner</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>It is important to approach claims made on social media with a critical eye. Many social media platforms are breeding grounds for misinformation, so it's important to verify any claims that you come across before accepting them as fact. It's also important to consider the source of the claim and the potential biases or motivations of the person or organization making the claim. Additionally, it's important to remember that not all claims can be verified, and some claims may be a matter of opinion or personal belief rather than fact. In cases like these, it's best to approach the claim with an open mind and consider it in the context of the other information that you have available.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>PARAGRAPH ABOUT SOCIAL MEDIA
</p><p>Now that we're in The Information Age, almost everyone has their social media accounts. It's really essential now especially now that we're in a pandemic. Social media helps us get informed on what is happening in the world today. It also helps us connect with our loved ones that are many miles away. Social media really helps us communicate with people easier than before! Though, social media has a lot of benefits, it has a lot of drawbacks as well since it's really inevitable. One drawback of social media is fake news. They are all over social media platforms and it fooled a lot of people. Everyone's probably been a victim of fake news. Because of this, the information age has become the disinformation age. Another drawback of social media is that it may lower the self-esteem of a person. People have a tendency to compare themselves to others and ask themselves questions such as "Why do I only have a few followers?", "Why do I only get a few likes", "Why does this person get a lot of attention when they post while I do not?". Social media may even lead people to depression.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Credits to the owner and I thank you</p><br />

                            17. Jane, who is now 19 years old, has lived with her grandparents since she was a month old. Her parents worked in Japan as overseas Filipino workers (OFWs). They do, however, keep in touch practically every day via social media. Her grandparents and parents describe her as a person who is picky about the friends with whom she forms tight bonds. Her grandparents saw that she chooses friends who share her characteristics and demonstrate the principles she espouses. She understands, however, that she cannot choose her family or the individuals with whom she will have to work in school and at her future workplace. Her pal describes her as a straightforward but discreet girl who is caring, fun to be around, insightful, and even filled with life's wisdom despite her young age. Her friends also noted that she respects her friends' individuality and treats them as equals, but always with the utmost respect. She does not take things subjectively, but rather objectively and based on facts, and she also researches. She is not judgmental and can connect with people from all walks of life. Her grandparents also noticed that the majority of her friends are 20 years older than she is. How would you characterize Jane's philosophical self? Back up your claim.​</h2><br />
