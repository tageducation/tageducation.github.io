                        <p>1. The use of color change across the two parts of this image because as we can see at the picture it shows that the right side part have colors while, the left side part has no color.</p><p>2. For me, the dark side makes me feel unsafe because it is full of darkness aura unlike the part of the side with colors.</p><p>3.  I think rich people are living in this house.</p><p>5. It makes me think that because of my observation and I can say and see that they are really different with each other, because the house is big like a mansion. </p><p>6.While on the other side part in left I think simple people are living in this house yet it looks like a lively house because of the color.</p><p>7. Simple person with a simple house.</p><p>9. The color influence our responses because we are basing of what our eyes are seeing. We can observe and differentiate things with the influence of colors around it.</p><p>10. Having a big house or a mansion doesn't mean that you are living life or can live life in happiness but instead sometimes it is more okay to live in a simple house with happiness in life.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Hope it helps.
