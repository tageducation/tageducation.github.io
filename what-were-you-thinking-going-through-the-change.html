                                            "Are You A Carrot, Egg or Coffee Bean?" A young woman went to her mother and told her about her life and how things were so hard for her. She did not know how she was going to make it and wanted to give up. She was tired of fighting and struggling. It seemed as one problem was solved a new one arose. Her mother took her to the kitchen. She filled three pots with water. In the first, she placed carrots, in the second she placed eggs, and the last she placed ground coffee beans. She let them sit and boil without saying a word. In about twenty minute she turned off the burners. She fished the carrots out and placed them in a bowl. She pulled the eggs out and placed them in a bowl. Then she ladled the coffee into a bowl. Turning to her daughter, she asked, "Tell me what you see?" "Carrots, eggs, and coffee," she replied. She brought her closer and asked her to feel the carrots. She did and noted that they were soft. She then asked her to take an egg and break it. After pulling off the shell, she observed the hard-boiled egg. Finally, she asked her to sip the coffee. The daughter smiled, as she tasted its rich aroma. The daughter then asked, "What's the point, mother?" Her mother explained that each of these objects had faced the same adversity... boiling water - but each reacted differently. The carrot went in strong, hard, and unrelenting. However, after being subjected to the boiling water, it softened and became weak. The egg had been fragile. Its thin outer shell had protected its liquid interior. But, after being through the boiling water, its inside became hardened. The ground coffee beans were unique, however. After they were in the boiling water they had changed the water. "Which are you?" she asked the daughter. "When adversity knocks on your door, how do you respond? Are you a carrot, an egg, or a coffee bean?" Think of this: Which am I? Am I the carrot that seems strong, but with pain and adversity, do I wilt and become soft and lose my strength? Am I the egg that starts with a malleable heart, but changes with the heat? Did I have a fluid spirit, but after death, a break up, a financial hardship, or some other trial, have I become hardened and stiff? Does my shell look the same, but on the inside am I bitter and tough with a stiff spirit and a hardened heart? Or am I like the coffee bean? The bean actually changes the hot water, the very circumstance that brings the pain. When the water gets hot, it releases the fragrance and flavor. If you are like the bean, when things are at their worst, you get better and change the situation around you. When the hours are the darkest and trials are their greatest do you elevate to another level? How do you handle adversity? ARE YOU A CARROT, AN EGG, OR A COFFEE BEAN?make an essay using this guide questions:1. what is the story about?2. what message does it convey?3. as a family how can you apply the lessons you learned from the story?​</a>

(PLEASE TELL ME THE MORAL OF THE STORY AND PLOT OF THE STORY)
Please i rlly need it now thank you
Reading about weather in books is one thing, but living through a natural disaster was another. Even though the flood was not too bad, I was not prepared for what it was really like!
It all started two days ago. It was a rainy day, like every other rainy day I’ve ever remembered. The only unusual thing was how anxious the adults seemed to be getting. I started to pay more attention whenever I saw the news on at our house, at a restaurant, or anywhere else. The meteorologists kept saying that the rain hadn’t stopped in a long time, and it didn’t look like it was going to stop anytime soon. I didn’t really know what that meant for us, since Mom was always saying that rain was good for all the plants. The next morning, however, I began to understand. 
I woke up and went down for breakfast. Usually Mom or Dad was already eating by the time that I woke up, but neither of them was at the kitchen table, and the lights all over the house were off. This is weird, I thought. I went to get out the milk, but there was a note on the refrigerator telling me not to open the door. As I was wondering what I could eat for breakfast, I noticed that the rain was still going, and that I could hear noises coming from the basement. I went to investigate. Peeking through the basement door, I immediately stopped. There was water down there! It didn’t look like a lot, but there were toys and things floating by! I could hear Mom and Dad’s voices. 
“Hello? What’s going on down here?” I called down the stairs. “Good morning, Vicky. All of this rain is causing some problems. The power all over town is out. Our basement is flooded, and so are some of the roads. A lot of houses have water in them, too,” Dad called back.
A little water didn’t seem too bad, and the power had gone out before, so I wasn’t too worried. Mom and Dad seemed to be taking care of it. They were talking about a pump, so I think they were getting the water out of the basement. I went to go play in my room. 
Not too long after, Mom and Dad came back upstairs, changed their clothes, and washed their hands using hand sanitizer. I asked them what was going on. 
“Well, we pumped the water out by hand, but there’s some damage downstairs. We’re going to have to find some fans once the power comes back to try to dry out the basement as much as we can, but we might have to tear out the drywall and replace it. There are things that got all wet that we’re going to have to replace, too. It’s quite the mess,” Mom said. “We’re also going to have to see if we can get a generator, it looks like the power will probably be out for the rest of the day.” 
We decided to drive around to see how other people in our town were doing. There were a lot of roads that were closed because of water covering the road, so we couldn’t get to the store. One bridge over the river was closed because water was rushing over it! The houses by the river looked like they were in the river. We stopped to help people who were filling bags with sand. The bags helped to keep the water away. They said their neighbors across the street were in another town living with relatives until their house could be repaired. I couldn’t believe how much the flood was affecting us! When we finished filling up sandbags, we drove back home. 
“I can’t believe those people lost all of their clothes and household items. We should go through our stuff and see what we can donate. We’re lucky we only had a couple of inches of water in our basement, it could have been a lot worse,” said Dad. Mom and I agreed. Even though we didn’t have power and fixing the basement could get expensive, we were lucky.</a>

How do these literary devices help the writer in putting message across?Traditionally Black Saturday is the scariest day in the Catholic calendar—adults shushing children by saying “Patay ang Diyos!” (“God is dead,” and they weren’t quoting Voltaire). On this bleak day I figured I might as well have that dark night of the soul I’ve been warding off with routines and books.Might as well plunge in: We’re not going back to the way things were on March 12, 2020. On April 30 we’re not going to run out the door, hug the friends and family we’ve missed, go out to dinner at the packed restaurant everyone was raving about, and then wind up at a bar to drink too much and have random, life-changing conversations with fascinating strangers who never turn up on dating apps. Those days are gone.This is dire, so if you’re feeling fragile, stop reading now.The second we come out of the house and mingle with other people, infection rates will go up. If too many people get sick, there will be further lockdowns. We cannot count on herd immunity until the vaccine arrives, and that will take at least 12 months. I’ve been thinking of the pandemic as an amorphous Big Bad, so I’ve attached numbers to my fear to give it clarity.There are 13 million people in Metro Manila. Assume a Thanos snap scenario: half the population gets coronavirus. That’s 6.5 million people. According to data reports from different countries, 20 percent of the infected need hospitalization. That’s 1.3 million people. 5 percent of them will need to be in the ICU. That’s 65,000 people. Metro Manila’s hospitals cannot handle that, and the people with other diseases. People will die. People we care about may get sick and die.Lockdown slows down contagion, but it cannot be extended indefinitely because we need to go to work or the economy will collapse. The coming months will be tough. Social distancing has to be strictly enforced. Shops will have to admit fewer customers on their premises, move online, or shut down. The travel and tourism industry may try to reopen, but forget about cheap fares on crowded flights and packed festivals. Organizers of parties and events have to rethink their businesses. Many people will lose their jobs. With fewer jobs to be had, many in the middle class will fall into poverty. Poor families will starve. Hunger, mental illness, domestic violence, other diseases that cannot be attended to by Covid-overwhelmed hospitals will kill more people than coronavirus does. Desperation will drive people to commit crime. The immediate future looks bleak.In Lord of the Rings terms we have just reached Moria. In Dune terms, Sardaukar are chasing us into the desert and into the mouth of Shai-Hulud. I refer to Tolkien and Dune (and Buffy and the Avengers, and sure let’s bring in Game of Thrones and every epic fantasy we’ve ever followed) not just to make myself feel better, but as a reminder that this terrible time will come to an end. We just have to make it through the next 18 months. The occasional dark night of worry, self-pity, even hysteria is okay because we have to let our fear out or it will consume us. But we cannot give in to despair. Our survival depends on believing that we will overcome this, and doing what we must to overcome this.This is the litany. Wear mask and gloves outside the house. Always be six feet away from other people. Wash your hands constantly. Take care of yourself. Take care of other people (from a distance). Support the frontliners, including the workers who keep groceries, pharmacies, and public utilities running. Donate to organizations that give food assistance to communities in need.Do your work as best as you can. Push government to release the social amelioration funds now. If you have any ideas at all about how we can address this crisis, even far-out ideas since we are in unknown territory now, send them over. The systems and conditions, excesses and absences that allowed the virus to rip through the world and shut it down—those must change. Be of good cheer. Remind yourself that this pandemic will end.We are standing in the rubble of the old world, and we have to build a new and better one. I want to see that.​</a>

Walking on the Moon
When I was in Grade 3, I got to take a trip to the moon. I remember
the day like it was yesterday. It was one of the strangest experiences I’d
ever had.
It all started when Miss Reyes, our Grade 3 Science teacher, was
showing a video about the different planets in the solar system. Halfway
through the video, I noticed a sparkling metal disc, about the size of a peso
18
PIVOT 4A CALABARZON
E
coin, lying on the floor. I kept trying to pay attention to the video, but found
myself bending over to pick up the shiny disk that was next to my desk.
As soon as I touched the metal disk, something strange happened.
I wasn’t in the classroom anymore. I was hovering in the air, way above
the school. I could see the whole or rather the rooftops of the whole city.
I was a little nervous, but also pretty excited. What was happening? How
could I be floating?
It was then when I remembered the metal disk I’d picked up from
the floor earlier. Did it I have something to do with the strange things that
were happening to me right now? I opened my palm and looked closely at
the disk. On the disk were these words:
“Floating through the air, like a helium filled balloon, your travels will
not stop, until you reach the moon”
The next thing I knew, I was soaring through space, dodging
satellites and asteroids. Oddly enough, I wasn’t cold and I was able to
breathe just fine. Before I knew it, I was standing on the moon. It was
amazing! It looked very different from the Earth. No trees, water, nor
houses. There wasn’t even any wind .
For each step I took I would bounce way up into the air. Every step
took left a huge footprint in the dust. I had to be careful and make sure
I didn’t jump into a crater because I wasn’t sure if I’d be able to get
out. Sometimes I couldn’t even see the bottom. I was bounding over to
something in the distance that looked very out of the place. When I got
there, I realized it was a flag. On the flag were the words: “To go to Earth,
close your eyes and think of what you’ve learned. You will find in no time at
all, you will be returned”. I wasn’t sure I wanted to go back just yet, but
I knew it might get dark soon and I didn’t want to be on the moon by
myself in the dark. I decided to close my eyes and think of the weather and
other characteristics of the moon I’d learned that day.
When I opened my eyes I was sitting on my seat in my Science
classroom. Miss Reyes was turning on the lights because the video was
over. I sat there wondering about what just happened. I opened my hand to
look at the metal disk, but it was gone! Did I really take a trip to the moon
or was it just a dream?

How do these literary devices help the writer in putting message across?Traditionally Black Saturday is the scariest day in the Catholic calendar—adults shushing children by saying “Patay ang Diyos!” (“God is dead,” and they weren’t quoting Voltaire). On this bleak day I figured I might as well have that dark night of the soul I’ve been warding off with routines and books.Might as well plunge in: We’re not going back to the way things were on March 12, 2020. On April 30 we’re not going to run out the door, hug the friends and family we’ve missed, go out to dinner at the packed restaurant everyone was raving about, and then wind up at a bar to drink too much and have random, life-changing conversations with fascinating strangers who never turn up on dating apps. Those days are gone.This is dire, so if you’re feeling fragile, stop reading now.The second we come out of the house and mingle with other people, infection rates will go up. If too many people get sick, there will be further lockdowns. We cannot count on herd immunity until the vaccine arrives, and that will take at least 12 months. I’ve been thinking of the pandemic as an amorphous Big Bad, so I’ve attached numbers to my fear to give it clarity.There are 13 million people in Metro Manila. Assume a Thanos snap scenario: half the population gets coronavirus. That’s 6.5 million people. According to data reports from different countries, 20 percent of the infected need hospitalization. That’s 1.3 million people. 5 percent of them will need to be in the ICU. That’s 65,000 people. Metro Manila’s hospitals cannot handle that, and the people with other diseases. People will die. People we care about may get sick and die.Lockdown slows down contagion, but it cannot be extended indefinitely because we need to go to work or the economy will collapse. The coming months will be tough. Social distancing has to be strictly enforced. Shops will have to admit fewer customers on their premises, move online, or shut down. The travel and tourism industry may try to reopen, but forget about cheap fares on crowded flights and packed festivals. Organizers of parties and events have to rethink their businesses. Many people will lose their jobs. With fewer jobs to be had, many in the middle class will fall into poverty. Poor families will starve. Hunger, mental illness, domestic violence, other diseases that cannot be attended to by Covid-overwhelmed hospitals will kill more people than coronavirus does. Desperation will drive people to commit crime. The immediate future looks bleak.In Lord of the Rings terms we have just reached Moria. In Dune terms, Sardaukar are chasing us into the desert and into the mouth of Shai-Hulud. I refer to Tolkien and Dune (and Buffy and the Avengers, and sure let’s bring in Game of Thrones and every epic fantasy we’ve ever followed) not just to make myself feel better, but as a reminder that this terrible time will come to an end. We just have to make it through the next 18 months. The occasional dark night of worry, self-pity, even hysteria is okay because we have to let our fear out or it will consume us. But we cannot give in to despair. Our survival depends on believing that we will overcome this, and doing what we must to overcome this.This is the litany. Wear mask and gloves outside the house. Always be six feet away from other people. Wash your hands constantly. Take care of yourself. Take care of other people (from a distance). Support the frontliners, including the workers who keep groceries, pharmacies, and public utilities running. Donate to organizations that give food assistance to communities in need.Do your work as best as you can. Push government to release the social amelioration funds now. If you have any ideas at all about how we can address this crisis, even far-out ideas since we are in unknown territory now, send them over. The systems and conditions, excesses and absences that allowed the virus to rip through the world and shut it down—those must change. Be of good cheer. Remind yourself that this pandemic will end.We are standing in the rubble of the old world, and we have to build a new and better one. I want to see that.​</a>

He had compassion on it, andtaking it up, placed it in hisbosom. The snake was quicklyrevived by the warmth, and resumingits natural instincts, bit the monkey, inflicting on him a mortal wound.6. The Flies and the Honey PotA number of flies were attracted to a jar of honey which had been overturned in a housekeeper'sroom, and placing their feet in it, ate greedily. Their feet, however, became so smearedwith the honey that they could not use their wings, nor release themselves, and were suffocated.7. The Goose with the Golden EggsOne day, a monkey went to the nest of his goose and found there an egg all yellow and glittering.When he took it up, it was as heavy as lead and he was going to throw it away, because hethought a trick had been played upon him. But, on second thought, he took it home and soonfound to his delight that it was an egg of pure gold. Every morning the same thing occurred, andhe soon became rich by selling his eggs. As he grew rich, he grew greedy; and thinking to get atonce all the gold the goose could give, he killed it and opened it only to find nothing8. The Fir Tree and the BrambleA fir tree said boastingly to the bramble. "You are useful for nothing at all; while I am everywhereused for roofs and houses.” The bramble answered, "You poor creature, if you would only callto mind the axes and saws which are about to hew you down, you would have reason to wish thatyou had grown up a bramble, not a fir tree."9. The Monkey and the CookiesA monkey put his hand into a jar of cookies. He grasped as many as he could possibly hold,but when he tried to pull out his hand, he was prevented from doing so by the neck of the cookie jar.Unwilling to lose the cookies, and yet unable to withdraw his hand, he burst into tears and bitterlylamented his disappointment.10. The Crow and the PitcherA crow perishing with thirst saw a pitcher, and hoping to find water, flew to it with delight. Whenhe reached it, he discovered to his grief that it contained so little water that he could not possiblyget at it. He tried everything he could think of to reach the water, but all his efforts were in vain.At last, he collected as many stones as he could carry and dropped them one by one with his beakinto the pitcher, until he brought the water within his reach and thus saved his life.​kaylangan po pa sogot</a>

                                            I want you to stay outdoors and play, “Catch the Ball” with your sibling or friend. If it is not possible for you to do this with someone, you can also just throw the ball towards a wall then catch it. After throwing and catching the ball for a while, think, “what am I catching”?
Imagine that what you are catching are feelings. Those were some of the feelings you caught during the lockdown/pandemic/disaster. They are feelings of fear, boredom, anxiety, etc. Stop playing for a moment. You accepted the ball. Hold it. Look at it. Accept the feeling. Say to yourself, “Yes, I was feeling afraid.” Or “Yes, I was feeling anxious.”

                            13. "Are You A Carrot, Egg or Coffee Bean?" A young woman went to her mother and told her about her life and how things were so hard for her. She did not know how she was going to make it and wanted to give up. She was tired of fighting and struggling. It seemed as one problem was solved a new one arose. Her mother took her to the kitchen. She filled three pots with water. In the first, she placed carrots, in the second she placed eggs, and the last she placed ground coffee beans. She let them sit and boil without saying a word. In about twenty minute she turned off the burners. She fished the carrots out and placed them in a bowl. She pulled the eggs out and placed them in a bowl. Then she ladled the coffee into a bowl. Turning to her daughter, she asked, "Tell me what you see?" "Carrots, eggs, and coffee," she replied. She brought her closer and asked her to feel the carrots. She did and noted that they were soft. She then asked her to take an egg and break it. After pulling off the shell, she observed the hard-boiled egg. Finally, she asked her to sip the coffee. The daughter smiled, as she tasted its rich aroma. The daughter then asked, "What's the point, mother?" Her mother explained that each of these objects had faced the same adversity... boiling water - but each reacted differently. The carrot went in strong, hard, and unrelenting. However, after being subjected to the boiling water, it softened and became weak. The egg had been fragile. Its thin outer shell had protected its liquid interior. But, after being through the boiling water, its inside became hardened. The ground coffee beans were unique, however. After they were in the boiling water they had changed the water. "Which are you?" she asked the daughter. "When adversity knocks on your door, how do you respond? Are you a carrot, an egg, or a coffee bean?" Think of this: Which am I? Am I the carrot that seems strong, but with pain and adversity, do I wilt and become soft and lose my strength? Am I the egg that starts with a malleable heart, but changes with the heat? Did I have a fluid spirit, but after death, a break up, a financial hardship, or some other trial, have I become hardened and stiff? Does my shell look the same, but on the inside am I bitter and tough with a stiff spirit and a hardened heart? Or am I like the coffee bean? The bean actually changes the hot water, the very circumstance that brings the pain. When the water gets hot, it releases the fragrance and flavor. If you are like the bean, when things are at their worst, you get better and change the situation around you. When the hours are the darkest and trials are their greatest do you elevate to another level? How do you handle adversity? ARE YOU A CARROT, AN EGG, OR A COFFEE BEAN?make an essay using this guide questions:1. what is the story about?2. what message does it convey?3. as a family how can you apply the lessons you learned from the story?​</h2><br />

                            16. After the Flood
(PLEASE TELL ME THE MORAL OF THE STORY AND PLOT OF THE STORY)
Please i rlly need it now thank you
Reading about weather in books is one thing, but living through a natural disaster was another. Even though the flood was not too bad, I was not prepared for what it was really like!
It all started two days ago. It was a rainy day, like every other rainy day I’ve ever remembered. The only unusual thing was how anxious the adults seemed to be getting. I started to pay more attention whenever I saw the news on at our house, at a restaurant, or anywhere else. The meteorologists kept saying that the rain hadn’t stopped in a long time, and it didn’t look like it was going to stop anytime soon. I didn’t really know what that meant for us, since Mom was always saying that rain was good for all the plants. The next morning, however, I began to understand. 
I woke up and went down for breakfast. Usually Mom or Dad was already eating by the time that I woke up, but neither of them was at the kitchen table, and the lights all over the house were off. This is weird, I thought. I went to get out the milk, but there was a note on the refrigerator telling me not to open the door. As I was wondering what I could eat for breakfast, I noticed that the rain was still going, and that I could hear noises coming from the basement. I went to investigate. Peeking through the basement door, I immediately stopped. There was water down there! It didn’t look like a lot, but there were toys and things floating by! I could hear Mom and Dad’s voices. 
“Hello? What’s going on down here?” I called down the stairs. “Good morning, Vicky. All of this rain is causing some problems. The power all over town is out. Our basement is flooded, and so are some of the roads. A lot of houses have water in them, too,” Dad called back.
A little water didn’t seem too bad, and the power had gone out before, so I wasn’t too worried. Mom and Dad seemed to be taking care of it. They were talking about a pump, so I think they were getting the water out of the basement. I went to go play in my room. 
Not too long after, Mom and Dad came back upstairs, changed their clothes, and washed their hands using hand sanitizer. I asked them what was going on. 
“Well, we pumped the water out by hand, but there’s some damage downstairs. We’re going to have to find some fans once the power comes back to try to dry out the basement as much as we can, but we might have to tear out the drywall and replace it. There are things that got all wet that we’re going to have to replace, too. It’s quite the mess,” Mom said. “We’re also going to have to see if we can get a generator, it looks like the power will probably be out for the rest of the day.” 
We decided to drive around to see how other people in our town were doing. There were a lot of roads that were closed because of water covering the road, so we couldn’t get to the store. One bridge over the river was closed because water was rushing over it! The houses by the river looked like they were in the river. We stopped to help people who were filling bags with sand. The bags helped to keep the water away. They said their neighbors across the street were in another town living with relatives until their house could be repaired. I couldn’t believe how much the flood was affecting us! When we finished filling up sandbags, we drove back home. 
“I can’t believe those people lost all of their clothes and household items. We should go through our stuff and see what we can donate. We’re lucky we only had a couple of inches of water in our basement, it could have been a lot worse,” said Dad. Mom and I agreed. Even though we didn’t have power and fixing the basement could get expensive, we were lucky.</h2><br />

                            19. What are the Literary devices used in the text? How do these literary devices help the writer in putting message across?Traditionally Black Saturday is the scariest day in the Catholic calendar—adults shushing children by saying “Patay ang Diyos!” (“God is dead,” and they weren’t quoting Voltaire). On this bleak day I figured I might as well have that dark night of the soul I’ve been warding off with routines and books.Might as well plunge in: We’re not going back to the way things were on March 12, 2020. On April 30 we’re not going to run out the door, hug the friends and family we’ve missed, go out to dinner at the packed restaurant everyone was raving about, and then wind up at a bar to drink too much and have random, life-changing conversations with fascinating strangers who never turn up on dating apps. Those days are gone.This is dire, so if you’re feeling fragile, stop reading now.The second we come out of the house and mingle with other people, infection rates will go up. If too many people get sick, there will be further lockdowns. We cannot count on herd immunity until the vaccine arrives, and that will take at least 12 months. I’ve been thinking of the pandemic as an amorphous Big Bad, so I’ve attached numbers to my fear to give it clarity.There are 13 million people in Metro Manila. Assume a Thanos snap scenario: half the population gets coronavirus. That’s 6.5 million people. According to data reports from different countries, 20 percent of the infected need hospitalization. That’s 1.3 million people. 5 percent of them will need to be in the ICU. That’s 65,000 people. Metro Manila’s hospitals cannot handle that, and the people with other diseases. People will die. People we care about may get sick and die.Lockdown slows down contagion, but it cannot be extended indefinitely because we need to go to work or the economy will collapse. The coming months will be tough. Social distancing has to be strictly enforced. Shops will have to admit fewer customers on their premises, move online, or shut down. The travel and tourism industry may try to reopen, but forget about cheap fares on crowded flights and packed festivals. Organizers of parties and events have to rethink their businesses. Many people will lose their jobs. With fewer jobs to be had, many in the middle class will fall into poverty. Poor families will starve. Hunger, mental illness, domestic violence, other diseases that cannot be attended to by Covid-overwhelmed hospitals will kill more people than coronavirus does. Desperation will drive people to commit crime. The immediate future looks bleak.In Lord of the Rings terms we have just reached Moria. In Dune terms, Sardaukar are chasing us into the desert and into the mouth of Shai-Hulud. I refer to Tolkien and Dune (and Buffy and the Avengers, and sure let’s bring in Game of Thrones and every epic fantasy we’ve ever followed) not just to make myself feel better, but as a reminder that this terrible time will come to an end. We just have to make it through the next 18 months. The occasional dark night of worry, self-pity, even hysteria is okay because we have to let our fear out or it will consume us. But we cannot give in to despair. Our survival depends on believing that we will overcome this, and doing what we must to overcome this.This is the litany. Wear mask and gloves outside the house. Always be six feet away from other people. Wash your hands constantly. Take care of yourself. Take care of other people (from a distance). Support the frontliners, including the workers who keep groceries, pharmacies, and public utilities running. Donate to organizations that give food assistance to communities in need.Do your work as best as you can. Push government to release the social amelioration funds now. If you have any ideas at all about how we can address this crisis, even far-out ideas since we are in unknown territory now, send them over. The systems and conditions, excesses and absences that allowed the virus to rip through the world and shut it down—those must change. Be of good cheer. Remind yourself that this pandemic will end.We are standing in the rubble of the old world, and we have to build a new and better one. I want to see that.​</h2><br />

Walking on the Moon
When I was in Grade 3, I got to take a trip to the moon. I remember
the day like it was yesterday. It was one of the strangest experiences I’d
ever had.
It all started when Miss Reyes, our Grade 3 Science teacher, was
showing a video about the different planets in the solar system. Halfway
through the video, I noticed a sparkling metal disc, about the size of a peso
18
PIVOT 4A CALABARZON
E
coin, lying on the floor. I kept trying to pay attention to the video, but found
myself bending over to pick up the shiny disk that was next to my desk.
As soon as I touched the metal disk, something strange happened.
I wasn’t in the classroom anymore. I was hovering in the air, way above
the school. I could see the whole or rather the rooftops of the whole city.
I was a little nervous, but also pretty excited. What was happening? How
could I be floating?
It was then when I remembered the metal disk I’d picked up from
the floor earlier. Did it I have something to do with the strange things that
were happening to me right now? I opened my palm and looked closely at
the disk. On the disk were these words:
“Floating through the air, like a helium filled balloon, your travels will
not stop, until you reach the moon”
The next thing I knew, I was soaring through space, dodging
satellites and asteroids. Oddly enough, I wasn’t cold and I was able to
breathe just fine. Before I knew it, I was standing on the moon. It was
amazing! It looked very different from the Earth. No trees, water, nor
houses. There wasn’t even any wind .
For each step I took I would bounce way up into the air. Every step
took left a huge footprint in the dust. I had to be careful and make sure
I didn’t jump into a crater because I wasn’t sure if I’d be able to get
out. Sometimes I couldn’t even see the bottom. I was bounding over to
something in the distance that looked very out of the place. When I got
there, I realized it was a flag. On the flag were the words: “To go to Earth,
close your eyes and think of what you’ve learned. You will find in no time at
all, you will be returned”. I wasn’t sure I wanted to go back just yet, but
I knew it might get dark soon and I didn’t want to be on the moon by
myself in the dark. I decided to close my eyes and think of the weather and
other characteristics of the moon I’d learned that day.
When I opened my eyes I was sitting on my seat in my Science
classroom. Miss Reyes was turning on the lights because the video was
over. I sat there wondering about what just happened. I opened my hand to
look at the metal disk, but it was gone! Did I really take a trip to the moon
or was it just a dream?

                            27. What are the Literary devices used in the text? How do these literary devices help the writer in putting message across?Traditionally Black Saturday is the scariest day in the Catholic calendar—adults shushing children by saying “Patay ang Diyos!” (“God is dead,” and they weren’t quoting Voltaire). On this bleak day I figured I might as well have that dark night of the soul I’ve been warding off with routines and books.Might as well plunge in: We’re not going back to the way things were on March 12, 2020. On April 30 we’re not going to run out the door, hug the friends and family we’ve missed, go out to dinner at the packed restaurant everyone was raving about, and then wind up at a bar to drink too much and have random, life-changing conversations with fascinating strangers who never turn up on dating apps. Those days are gone.This is dire, so if you’re feeling fragile, stop reading now.The second we come out of the house and mingle with other people, infection rates will go up. If too many people get sick, there will be further lockdowns. We cannot count on herd immunity until the vaccine arrives, and that will take at least 12 months. I’ve been thinking of the pandemic as an amorphous Big Bad, so I’ve attached numbers to my fear to give it clarity.There are 13 million people in Metro Manila. Assume a Thanos snap scenario: half the population gets coronavirus. That’s 6.5 million people. According to data reports from different countries, 20 percent of the infected need hospitalization. That’s 1.3 million people. 5 percent of them will need to be in the ICU. That’s 65,000 people. Metro Manila’s hospitals cannot handle that, and the people with other diseases. People will die. People we care about may get sick and die.Lockdown slows down contagion, but it cannot be extended indefinitely because we need to go to work or the economy will collapse. The coming months will be tough. Social distancing has to be strictly enforced. Shops will have to admit fewer customers on their premises, move online, or shut down. The travel and tourism industry may try to reopen, but forget about cheap fares on crowded flights and packed festivals. Organizers of parties and events have to rethink their businesses. Many people will lose their jobs. With fewer jobs to be had, many in the middle class will fall into poverty. Poor families will starve. Hunger, mental illness, domestic violence, other diseases that cannot be attended to by Covid-overwhelmed hospitals will kill more people than coronavirus does. Desperation will drive people to commit crime. The immediate future looks bleak.In Lord of the Rings terms we have just reached Moria. In Dune terms, Sardaukar are chasing us into the desert and into the mouth of Shai-Hulud. I refer to Tolkien and Dune (and Buffy and the Avengers, and sure let’s bring in Game of Thrones and every epic fantasy we’ve ever followed) not just to make myself feel better, but as a reminder that this terrible time will come to an end. We just have to make it through the next 18 months. The occasional dark night of worry, self-pity, even hysteria is okay because we have to let our fear out or it will consume us. But we cannot give in to despair. Our survival depends on believing that we will overcome this, and doing what we must to overcome this.This is the litany. Wear mask and gloves outside the house. Always be six feet away from other people. Wash your hands constantly. Take care of yourself. Take care of other people (from a distance). Support the frontliners, including the workers who keep groceries, pharmacies, and public utilities running. Donate to organizations that give food assistance to communities in need.Do your work as best as you can. Push government to release the social amelioration funds now. If you have any ideas at all about how we can address this crisis, even far-out ideas since we are in unknown territory now, send them over. The systems and conditions, excesses and absences that allowed the virus to rip through the world and shut it down—those must change. Be of good cheer. Remind yourself that this pandemic will end.We are standing in the rubble of the old world, and we have to build a new and better one. I want to see that.​</h2><br />

He had compassion on it, andtaking it up, placed it in hisbosom. The snake was quicklyrevived by the warmth, and resumingits natural instincts, bit the monkey, inflicting on him a mortal wound.6. The Flies and the Honey PotA number of flies were attracted to a jar of honey which had been overturned in a housekeeper'sroom, and placing their feet in it, ate greedily. Their feet, however, became so smearedwith the honey that they could not use their wings, nor release themselves, and were suffocated.7. The Goose with the Golden EggsOne day, a monkey went to the nest of his goose and found there an egg all yellow and glittering.When he took it up, it was as heavy as lead and he was going to throw it away, because hethought a trick had been played upon him. But, on second thought, he took it home and soonfound to his delight that it was an egg of pure gold. Every morning the same thing occurred, andhe soon became rich by selling his eggs. As he grew rich, he grew greedy; and thinking to get atonce all the gold the goose could give, he killed it and opened it only to find nothing8. The Fir Tree and the BrambleA fir tree said boastingly to the bramble. "You are useful for nothing at all; while I am everywhereused for roofs and houses.” The bramble answered, "You poor creature, if you would only callto mind the axes and saws which are about to hew you down, you would have reason to wish thatyou had grown up a bramble, not a fir tree."9. The Monkey and the CookiesA monkey put his hand into a jar of cookies. He grasped as many as he could possibly hold,but when he tried to pull out his hand, he was prevented from doing so by the neck of the cookie jar.Unwilling to lose the cookies, and yet unable to withdraw his hand, he burst into tears and bitterlylamented his disappointment.10. The Crow and the PitcherA crow perishing with thirst saw a pitcher, and hoping to find water, flew to it with delight. Whenhe reached it, he discovered to his grief that it contained so little water that he could not possiblyget at it. He tried everything he could think of to reach the water, but all his efforts were in vain.At last, he collected as many stones as he could carry and dropped them one by one with his beakinto the pitcher, until he brought the water within his reach and thus saved his life.​kaylangan po pa sogot</h2><br />

                            29. I want you to stay outdoors and play, “Catch the Ball” with your sibling or friend. If it is not possible for you to do this with someone, you can also just throw the ball towards a wall then catch it. After throwing and catching the ball for a while, think, “what am I catching”?
Imagine that what you are catching are feelings. Those were some of the feelings you caught during the lockdown/pandemic/disaster. They are feelings of fear, boredom, anxiety, etc. Stop playing for a moment. You accepted the ball. Hold it. Look at it. Accept the feeling. Say to yourself, “Yes, I was feeling afraid.” Or “Yes, I was feeling anxious.”
Catching your Feelings It is always good to catch what you are feeling. It is a normal and valid feeling. It’s okay to Not feel okay. But they are real and true only as the not-so-normal situation that triggers it.
