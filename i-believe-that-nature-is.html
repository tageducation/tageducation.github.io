Recently, I leamed to love Mother Nature. I realized how much she has provided for our needs. Sadly, we have been doing a lot of things that hurt her like not disposing our garbage properly or not replacing the trees that we cut. I also realized that when we do these things, we are actually hurting ourselves. By not taking care of Mother Nature, we are destroying the source of the things that we need to survive like the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the land we live in. I believe that we can do something about this in our own simple way. Lately, I started waste segregation. I know it is challenging if you are not used to it, but it is not impossible to do. If we change our habits little by little each day, we can eventually make that difference. I may be an ordinary citizen, but I play an important role in helping save Mother Nature. You can, too. 1.

                        <p> I believe that nature is wise, and that we all have deep instincts within us that can provide the wisdom to know when to eat, what to eat, and when to stop eating. Everyone has and needs these primal instincts. The Warrior Diet allows you to make changes, to binge on carbohydrates or fatty foods like nuts, and still be fine. Other diets don’t allow this freedom. I believe that feeling free should be a part of your life. By introducing you to the Warrior Diet, I hope to relay how this sense of freedom will enrich your life in many ways.</p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><br />

But also, because of our intelligence, we are capable of avoiding it. Take for example war. War is one of the most destructive things a human could ever do. Through our intelligence, we create weapons that kill, murder, etc. But we can also avoid war through our intelligence. We can easily discuss our differences through peaceful means and make options that will benefit every party. Humans are smart by nature. The world's sufferings can be fixed if we use our intelligence, not for violence, but for the betterment of our societies.</p><br />

Recently, I leamed to love Mother Nature. I realized how much she has provided for our needs. Sadly, we have been doing a lot of things that hurt her like not disposing our garbage properly or not replacing the trees that we cut. I also realized that when we do these things, we are actually hurting ourselves. By not taking care of Mother Nature, we are destroying the source of the things that we need to survive like the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the land we live in. I believe that we can do something about this in our own simple way. Lately, I started waste segregation. I know it is challenging if you are not used to it, but it is not impossible to do. If we change our habits little by little each day, we can eventually make that difference. I may be an ordinary citizen, but I play an important role in helping save Mother Nature. You can, too. 1.

                            20. Hi! I am Laura. Recently, I learned to love Mother Nature. I realized how much she has provided for our needs. Sadly, we have been doing a lot of things that hurt her like not disposing our garbage properly or not replacing the trees that we cut. I also realized that when we do these things, we are actually hurting ourselves. By not taking care of Mother Nature, we are destroying the source of the things that we need to survive like the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the land we live in. I believe th we can do something about this in our own simple way. Lately, I started waste segregation. I know it is challenging if you are not used to it, but it is not impossible to do. If we change our habits little by little each day, we can eventually make that difference. I may be an ordinary citizen, but I play an important role in helping save Mother Nature. You can, too.
