2. One advantage of qualitative research is that it involves a lot of research's subjectivity in data analysis.
3. The mixed method of research happens only in a quantitative research
4. Nursing in one example of hard sciences.
5. The purpose of research is to learn how to work scientifically and systematically
6. One purpose of doing research is not to improve your reading and writing skills.
7.All research types apply to all data collecting techniques
8. Sticking to one data collection technique is the best research method.
9. Subjectivity and objectivity are inseparable
10. Quantitative research tends to be more objective that subjective.
11. Biology and Chemistry are hard science.
12. The mixed methid of research happens only in quantitative research.
13.It is necessary for the qualitative researcher to conduct his or her research in a laboratory.
14. Qualitative research promotes a full understanding of human behaviour or personality traits in their natural setting.
15. Quantitative research requires non-numerical data, which means that the research uses words rather that numbers in to express the results.

Three of the most influential and common purposes of research are exploration, description and explanation.<strong> </strong><strong>Exploration</strong> involves familiarizing a researcher with a topic. Exploration satisfies the researcher's curiosity and desire for improved understanding. Exploration tests the feasibility of undertaking a more extensive study. Exploration helps develop the methods that will be used in a study.<strong> </strong><strong>Description</strong> involves describing situations and events through scientific observation. Scientific descriptions are typically more accurate and precise than causal ones. For example, the U. S. Census uses descriptive social research in its examination of characteristics of the U. S. population. Explanation involves answering the questions of what, where, when, and how. Explanatory studies answer questions of why. For example, an explanatory analysis of the 2002 General Social Survey (GSS) data indicates that 38 percent of men and 30 percent of women said marijuana should be legalized, while 55 percent of liberals and 27 percent of conservatives said the same. Given these statistics, you could start to develop an explanation for attitudes toward marijuana legalization. In addition, further study of gender and political orientation could lead to a deeper explanation of this issue.<p></p><br />

                        It will be more advanced and has more features I guess
The internet would definitely be more crowded. Privacy would probably be very minimal. With so much social media and information going around, I imagine that most of our lives would be shared to the public. <br /><br />We would most likely be very dependent on the internet for even small daily tasks. A lot of our appliances are starting to become Wi-Fi enabled and has apps that could do small tasks. In the future, maybe that feature would be enhanced and our homes would be super techy!<br /><br />
