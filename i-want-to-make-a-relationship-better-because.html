                                            Despite a less than ideal childhood, Anelisa marched against the grain and surprised his family when he was accepted into university. "Throughout my schooling, I stayed with my uncle and basically brought myself up as he is a taxi driver and works irregular hours and I received very little support from my family who live in the Eastern Cape," recounts Anelisa. Reflecting on the significance of 16 June in our country's history, Anelisa advises the country's youth to remember that our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate but that we are powerful beyond measure. "It's not our darkness but our light that most frightens us and as we let each one of our light's shine, we are unconsciously giving others the opportunity to do And his biggest concern about the world today? "A lack of humility! It seems many people work for financial gain only, rather than helping or contributing towards making the world a better place." Anelisa however believes that the world is full of opportunities. "With a great plan and enough ambition, we can all achieve all our goals." After fulfilling his dream of attending university, Anelisa graduated and was accepted on to Engen's prestigious graduate development programme. The Engen Graduate Development Programme sees graduates spend time across a broad range of business functions. To date Anelisa has worked in Engen's Fixed Asset Team and in the Tax Department as a graduate trainee. "I never imagined myself working for one of the petroleum industry leaders! "It was an exciting opportunity for me to join Engen and see how I can contribute to making the value chain more effective and efficient, so that ultimately real value is added to the end customer." As a graduate trainee at Engen, he is discovering where he best fits in within the company. "I really appreciate the company's culture and beliefs - they put their money into growing people skills, while the leadership style adopted by top management is indicative of how the company puts its employees first and creates a space for everyone to learn and grow as individuals." So, what is Anelisa's greatest ambition? "I really want to touch people's lives. I don't want to say change people's lives because I feel like it's up to each individual to change their own lives, but what I can do, is assist them in the process of changing their lives." Continuing to attract and grow talented young minds like Analisa Gazi, demonstrates Engen's ongoing commitment to developing our countries future experts and isaders. In 2020, the company invested R9.8 million in Learnerships and Bursaries. They also continue to provide supplementary Maths, Science and Technology tuition to approximately 1 800 under-privileged Grade 10 12 learners across South Africa through the Engen Maths and Science School programme.Questions1.2 Identify and explain TWO types of goals in line with Anelisa's story 1.3 Discuss any THREE challenges Anelisa experienced that could've been obstacles1.4 Analyse how Anelisa personal values contributed to his success1.5 Critically discuss how relationships can impact negatively on the achivements of goals ​</a>

Explain each briefly.Answer:GOD'S PLAN OF LOVE     God love his children and he care for us, for he is doing everything to help and save us from everything that might destroy us or hurt us. As a future pharmacist, I like to continue his plan of showing love and care to others in my own ways. We pharmacists must commit ourselves to our work, we must love and be true in this career that we choose. We must show our clients or patients our care for them, that all we want is to help them recover and make them feel better through out the treatment process. We are an instrument of God to fulfill his plan to show love and care to others, in a way that he send us to help and heal those people who are in struggle of sickness, who are in great pain of illness and others. We are to serve and save people's life that is our purpose, that is our mission as a future health care provider. And that is showing love to others by means of helping them and giving care for them to become better.COMMITMENT TO DIALOGUE     We must respect and accept the differences that all of us have like how we act or talk in front of other people. Afterall, we are not the same, we have lot of differences because we came from different places in the world following different cultures, beliefs, traditions, customs, languages and others. As a pharmacists, we must know how to approach or deal different kinds of patients or clients we are talking everyday. To avoid misunderstanding or any conflicts that might happen make sure to talk to them nicely, calmly and gently especially those patients having sensitive cases. We must build a good relationship with them by knowing important things about them. Also, those things we must avoid while communicating with them for them to feel secured and comfortable to you. Talk to them in a way that they will feel like you understand their situation, that you care for their recovery or that you want them to become better.</a>

Water covers more than 70% of the Earth’s surface and constitutes over 60% of the human body. If water is polluted, marine life, wildlife health and human well-being are affected extensively. To prevent pollution, there must be an immediate check on our daily habits and the types of products we consume, including our knowledge on the causes and effects of water pollution in the environment (Galapon, Relente and Angeles 2016, 150)2. English is my favorite subject because I love reading and writing stories about fairy tales, animals, plants, and toys. I also help my classmates who are struggling to read and write.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>it depends on who really, but i can give you this:</p><p>communication is always important in a relationship, if you know what the other wants and surely the other would surely want to know what you want! communication is always the answer, you can talk it all out instead of fighting, plus! you'll never get anywhere when you're fighting! No matter what happens, communicating (in my own experience) helps alot, by bringing me closer to that person and i am greatful enough to have that.</p><p></p><br />

                            21. Despite a less than ideal childhood, Anelisa marched against the grain and surprised his family when he was accepted into university. "Throughout my schooling, I stayed with my uncle and basically brought myself up as he is a taxi driver and works irregular hours and I received very little support from my family who live in the Eastern Cape," recounts Anelisa. Reflecting on the significance of 16 June in our country's history, Anelisa advises the country's youth to remember that our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate but that we are powerful beyond measure. "It's not our darkness but our light that most frightens us and as we let each one of our light's shine, we are unconsciously giving others the opportunity to do And his biggest concern about the world today? "A lack of humility! It seems many people work for financial gain only, rather than helping or contributing towards making the world a better place." Anelisa however believes that the world is full of opportunities. "With a great plan and enough ambition, we can all achieve all our goals." After fulfilling his dream of attending university, Anelisa graduated and was accepted on to Engen's prestigious graduate development programme. The Engen Graduate Development Programme sees graduates spend time across a broad range of business functions. To date Anelisa has worked in Engen's Fixed Asset Team and in the Tax Department as a graduate trainee. "I never imagined myself working for one of the petroleum industry leaders! "It was an exciting opportunity for me to join Engen and see how I can contribute to making the value chain more effective and efficient, so that ultimately real value is added to the end customer." As a graduate trainee at Engen, he is discovering where he best fits in within the company. "I really appreciate the company's culture and beliefs - they put their money into growing people skills, while the leadership style adopted by top management is indicative of how the company puts its employees first and creates a space for everyone to learn and grow as individuals." So, what is Anelisa's greatest ambition? "I really want to touch people's lives. I don't want to say change people's lives because I feel like it's up to each individual to change their own lives, but what I can do, is assist them in the process of changing their lives." Continuing to attract and grow talented young minds like Analisa Gazi, demonstrates Engen's ongoing commitment to developing our countries future experts and isaders. In 2020, the company invested R9.8 million in Learnerships and Bursaries. They also continue to provide supplementary Maths, Science and Technology tuition to approximately 1 800 under-privileged Grade 10 12 learners across South Africa through the Engen Maths and Science School programme.Questions1.2 Identify and explain TWO types of goals in line with Anelisa's story 1.3 Discuss any THREE challenges Anelisa experienced that could've been obstacles1.4 Analyse how Anelisa personal values contributed to his success1.5 Critically discuss how relationships can impact negatively on the achivements of goals ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>here u go :) -Malong</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>1.2 Two types of goals in line with Anelisa's story are:</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>a) Career goal: Anelisa's goal was to get into university and then find a job in a company that aligns with his values and beliefs. He achieved this goal by graduating from university and getting accepted into Engen's graduate development programme.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>b) Personal growth goal: Anelisa's goal was to touch people's lives and assist them in the process of changing their own lives. This goal reflects his desire to make a positive impact on others and to contribute to making the world a better place.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>1.3 Three challenges Anelisa experienced that could've been obstacles are:</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>a) Childhood: Anelisa had a less than ideal childhood and had to bring himself up. This could have impacted his self-esteem and motivation.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>b) Lack of family support: Anelisa received very little support from his family who lived in the Eastern Cape. This could have impacted his financial stability and made it harder for him to achieve his goals.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>c) Limited financial resources: Anelisa's uncle was a taxi driver and worked irregular hours. This could have made it difficult for him to pay for his education and other expenses.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>1.4 Anelisa's personal values contributed to his success in the following ways:</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>a) Determination: Anelisa's determination to succeed despite the challenges he faced showed his resilience and drive. He did not let his childhood or the lack of family support stop him from pursuing his goals.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>b) Ambition: Anelisa had a clear plan and enough ambition to achieve his goals. He recognized the opportunities available to him and took advantage of them.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>c) Empathy: Anelisa's desire to touch people's lives and assist them in the process of changing their own lives reflects his empathy and compassion for others. This desire also shows his genuine concern for making the world a better place.</strong></p><p><strong>1.5 Critically discuss how relationships can impact negatively on the achivements of goals ​</strong></p><p><strong>Relationships can have a significant impact on the achievement of goals, both positively and negatively. On the one hand, supportive and encouraging relationships can provide motivation and inspiration, as well as resources and guidance, to help individuals reach their goals. On the other hand, negative relationships can impede progress and discourage individuals from pursuing their goals.</strong></p><br />

                            22. Bringing to mind the fundamental approaches of CICM toward a unified mission, give at least two various vocation commitments you would like to carry out at the heart of a fruitful service and dedication in your future career and profession. Explain each briefly.Answer:GOD'S PLAN OF LOVE     God love his children and he care for us, for he is doing everything to help and save us from everything that might destroy us or hurt us. As a future pharmacist, I like to continue his plan of showing love and care to others in my own ways. We pharmacists must commit ourselves to our work, we must love and be true in this career that we choose. We must show our clients or patients our care for them, that all we want is to help them recover and make them feel better through out the treatment process. We are an instrument of God to fulfill his plan to show love and care to others, in a way that he send us to help and heal those people who are in struggle of sickness, who are in great pain of illness and others. We are to serve and save people's life that is our purpose, that is our mission as a future health care provider. And that is showing love to others by means of helping them and giving care for them to become better.COMMITMENT TO DIALOGUE     We must respect and accept the differences that all of us have like how we act or talk in front of other people. Afterall, we are not the same, we have lot of differences because we came from different places in the world following different cultures, beliefs, traditions, customs, languages and others. As a pharmacists, we must know how to approach or deal different kinds of patients or clients we are talking everyday. To avoid misunderstanding or any conflicts that might happen make sure to talk to them nicely, calmly and gently especially those patients having sensitive cases. We must build a good relationship with them by knowing important things about them. Also, those things we must avoid while communicating with them for them to feel secured and comfortable to you. Talk to them in a way that they will feel like you understand their situation, that you care for their recovery or that you want them to become better.</h2><br />

Water covers more than 70% of the Earth’s surface and constitutes over 60% of the human body. If water is polluted, marine life, wildlife health and human well-being are affected extensively. To prevent pollution, there must be an immediate check on our daily habits and the types of products we consume, including our knowledge on the causes and effects of water pollution in the environment (Galapon, Relente and Angeles 2016, 150)2. English is my favorite subject because I love reading and writing stories about fairy tales, animals, plants, and toys. I also help my classmates who are struggling to read and write. I always top the class in this subject. But I want to make sure that I work hard to love the other subjects.3. The sender transmits the message while the receiver accepts the message. The most important factor in communication is the good delivery of the message to ensure better understanding which will result in a satisfying answer. Moreover, the tool in communication is as important as the message being sent because it is the channel by which the message is delivered (Diaz 2020, 13)4. Used cans, either crushed or in their original form can be reused or recycled. However, some tin cans end up in landfill especially if they have undergone chemical change (rusting). When a metal starts to rust, it is hard to reuse because rust will continue to destroy it. To prevent metal from rusting, paintthe surface to prevent it from reacting with oxygen (Sarte 2016, 34)5. The Philippine is rich in coastal areas which are affected by the rising and receding tides because being an archipelago, the Philippines is surrounded by seas and oceans. These areas which are constantly exposed to the changing tides are called intertidal zones. Intertidal zones are home to many kinds of marine animals and birds.The daily changes in the tides play a major role to the life of living things in this area (Sarte 2016, 85)pa answer po ty​</h2><br />

Most of my assignments are due atthe same time, and a lot of them are time-consuming. -Isabella Sandoval____________4. As a student, my online experiencehas been interesting. What I like about this experience isthat I have more time to talk to my family and call or textsome friends. I get to do school work from home and I havetime for self-care.
