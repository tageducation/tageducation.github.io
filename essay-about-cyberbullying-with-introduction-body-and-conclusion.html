It may be parental/teen abuse, psychological disorders, hard living conditions etc. If mean teenagers simply entertain themselves at cost of well-being of others, then abused teens channel the pain and fear through aggression against others. Cyber-bullying may also take place on the part of whole groups, just like real-life bullying in schools does.</p><p>          The profile of a cyber-bully may partially explain why cyber-bullying takes place and what can be undertaken to stop it. However, the most valid explanation of cyber-bulling is that the Internet provided the additional tool for hurting others and ever-existing human aggression/pain sublimation/self-assertion migrated from the real world to the virtual space. Consequences of cyber-bulling for its victim are very serious, from depression and paranoia to suicide attempts.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p>basta yon na yun! hehe!</p><p></p><p>hope it helps!</p><p></p><br />

It is the use of technology to harass, humiliate, or threaten someone, and its impact can be devastating to those who fall victim to it. With the rise of social media and instant communication, cyberbullying has become a major issue that must be addressed. In this speech, we will explore the dangers of cyberbullying, the impact it can have on individuals, and the steps we can take to prevent it.</p><p></p><p>Body:</p><p>First, it is important to understand the dangers of cyberbullying. This type of bullying can be particularly harmful because it can be more widespread than traditional bullying. A cruel message or image can quickly spread to a large audience, causing immense damage to the victim. In addition, cyberbullying can follow the victim even after they have left the physical setting, causing long-term harm.</p><p></p><p>Second, it is crucial to recognize the impact that cyberbullying can have on individuals. For some, it can lead to depression, anxiety, and even thoughts of suicide. It can also affect their academic performance, leading to poor grades and a negative impact on their future prospects. The consequences of cyberbullying are far-reaching and can have a lasting impact on the victim's life.</p><p></p><p>Third, there are steps that we can take to prevent cyberbullying. It starts with education, teaching individuals about the dangers of cyberbullying and how to recognize it when it occurs. We must also encourage individuals to speak out against cyberbullying, whether they are the victim or a witness. In addition, technology companies must take responsibility for monitoring their platforms and taking action against those who engage in cyberbullying.</p><p></p><p>Conclusion:</p><p>In conclusion, cyberbullying is a growing concern that must be addressed. It is a destructive and harmful behavior that can have a lasting impact on individuals. We must take action to prevent it, through education, speaking out against it, and holding technology companies accountable. By working together, we can create a safer and more supportive online community for all.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Cyberbullying is bullying that takes place over digital devices like cell phones, computers, and tablets. Cyberbullying can occur through SMS, Text, and apps, or online in social media, forums, or gaming where people can view, participate in, or share content. Cyberbullying includes sending, posting, or sharing negative, harmful, false, or mean content about someone else. It can include sharing personal or private information about someone else causing embarrassment or humiliation. Some cyberbullying crosses the line into unlawful or criminal behavior.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>paki brainliest pls</p><p>Answer:</p><p>In today’s world which has been made smaller by technology, new age problems have been born. No doubt technology has a lot of benefits; however, it also comes with a negative side. It has given birth to cyberbullying. To put it simply, cyberbullying refers to the misuse of information technology with the intention to harass others.</p><p>Subsequently, cyberbullying comes in various forms. It doesn’t necessarily mean hacking someone’s profiles or posing to be someone else. It also includes posting negative comments about somebody or spreading rumors to defame someone. As everyone is caught up on the social network, it makes it very easy for anyone to misuse this access.</p><p>Cyberbullying is a multi-faced issue. However, the intention of this activity is one and the same. To hurt people and bring them harm. Cyberbullying is not a light matter. It needs to be taken seriously as it does have a lot of dangerous effects on the victim.</p><p>It also results in a lot of insecurities and complexes. The victim which suffers cyberbullying in the form of harassing starts having self-doubt. When someone points at your insecurities, they only tend to enhance.

                        <p>800 - Word essay about cyberbullying </p><p></p>AnswerIn my opinion, it’s too early to say, the rise of reported bullying cases is a consequence of the reporting requirements of the law.  Bullying cases is rampant, however, it remain under reported prior to the anti-bullying act. This is understandable, since no parents or even school administration would like his/her family or school to be famous because of bullying.
  Schools, however, to mitigate the effects and reduce the incidence of bullying, should comply with the Implementing Rules and Regulations of the Anti-bullying law of 2013 to address the root causes of bullying. Any severe or repeated use by one or more students of a written, verbal or electronic expression, or a physical act or gesture, or any combination thereof, directed at another student that has the effect of actually causing or placing the latter in reasonable fear of physical or emotional harm or damage to his property; creating a hostile environment at school for the other student; infringing on the rights of the other student at school; or materially and substantially disrupting the education process or the orderly operation of a school; such as, but not limited to, the following:

a. Any unwanted physical contact between the bully and the victim like punching, pushing, shoving, kicking, slapping, tickling, headlocks, inflicting school pranks, teasing, fighting and the use of available objects as weapons;

b. Any act that causes damage to a victim’s psyche and/or emotional well-being;

c. Any slanderous statement or accusation that causes the victim undue emotional distress like directing foul language or profanity at the target, name-calling, tormenting and commenting negatively on victim’s looks, clothes and body; and

d. Cyber-bullying or any bullying done through the use of technology or any electronic means.#BRAINLY.PH<br />

Cyberbullies are those who are immature and involved to a hate group. Cyberbullying is cause by pleasure of inflicting pain, jealousy, anger, and fun. Negative effects on psychological are: feel embarrassed, tend to act anxious, feel of being worthless and depression. For academics, feel disinterested in school, less contribution and having failing grades. Cyber bullying is not just a topic given to us student. It can be prevented by not sharing personal information; stop, block and tell, and by saving cyberbullying evidences. Cyberbullying is a serious crminal matter that is obligated to stop. We as a student can stop it by having a well disciplined manner when surfing on the internet.<br />

                        Cause &amp; Effect Essay: Bullying<br />Most people know that bullying is wrong. Calling someone names has absolutely no beneficial purpose. Moreover, hitting someone makes a bully feel good in the moment while doing permanent damage to the person being victimized. With the Internet, people now have even more opportunities to bully through cyberbullying. This includes sending crude pictures, posting fake web pages, or tweeting slanderous messages. Cyberbullying has subsequently led to a rise in a completely new kind of bullying.<br />One of the effects of bullying is that it can change the victim’s personality. It can cause people who are normally confident and happy to become self-conscious, shy, and unsure. Additionally, victims of bullying may also become sad or depressed. Their confidence might completely disappear, keeping them from trying new things or trusting people. Once a person has been bullied, they may hesitate to participate in situations where he or she might be ridiculed, such as in public speaking or in sports. A bullying victim might even begin to possess previously absent anxious<br />behavior.<br />Despite all the negative effects of bullying, there are even far more serious consequences. People who have been bullied sometimes become so upset, scared, or depressed that they see no worth in themselves and no way out of their torment. There have been countless reports over the past few years of students committing suicide because they were bullied. Meanwhile, there are times when victims see no recourse but to seek revenge by serious acts of violence against the bully and instigators. As a result of bullying, people can lose their ability to love and trust, denying them the chance to experience a quality relationship later in their life. They might find themselves as a submissive partner or they may want to be completely alone. Compounding all of these problems, victims often develop eating disorders, begin to self-injure, or require extensive counseling. Social bullying can also leave people without a supportive group of friends that they can lean on and spend time with.<br />Another unfortunate consequence of this is that bullying is often cyclical. People who have been bullied can, in an attempt to gain their power and self-esteem back, become bullies themselves. In relation to this, bullies who are not confronted or stopped may find themselves in future positions where they can bully as adults. This is where manipulative bosses and child abusers come from.<br />Aside from its long-term effects, some consequences of bullying can be seen and felt immediately. When one child calls another child names, the victim might cry and a bruise might appear after a punch to the arm. However, some effects of bullying are not always obvious to the naked eye. The results of bullying might grow and appear over time, damaging a person in profound ways for the long term. There are so many effects of bullying that they are impossible to count or predict. This is why it is so important to stop bullying.<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>ARGUMENTATIVE ESSAY ON CYBERBULLYING</p><p></p><p>Cyberbullying is a recent form of aggression that students use to humiliate and attack their less popular peers. Like traditional bullying, this behavior is based on the imbalance of power between bullies and victims and may continue for a long time. Cyberbullying manifests itself in posting and sharing abusive comments, photos, and videos, writing intimidating e-mails and messages, spreading rumors, etc. (Völlink, Dehue, &amp; Guckin, 2015). Unlike face-to-face school bullying, this type of aggression may occur at any time and in any place, so the victim cannot escape it. It is also more difficult to prevent bullying and punish abusers because they often remain anonymous. Cyberbullying has a detrimental effect on victims’ emotional and psychological health, so effective solutions to this phenomenon should be introduced to protect children.</p><p></p><p></p><p>The problem of cyberbullying is extremely difficult to address. Unlike school bullying that occurs in real life and can be detected by teachers and peers, this aggressive behavior is more elusive and invisible (Minton, 2013). Students rarely report being abused on the Internet, mostly because they realize that their parents and teachers would not help them. The problem is that even when a student reports cyberbullying, it is practically impossible to identify its source and punish abusers. For now, schools lack comprehensive anti-bulling policies and cannot come up with actual strategies and tactics to tackle this growing problem. Parents also seem to lack understanding of how detrimental cyberbullying may be for their children’s health and do not know how to support them.</p><p></p><p>I strongly believe that effective solutions to cyberbullying need to be introduced. The most important thing that needs to be done is student education. Children need to understand how cyberbullying affects them and their peers and why this type of behavior is unacceptable. They also need to be encouraged to seek professional advice and support of psychologists when cyber bullying bothers them. Parents should also be educated to detect the slight changes in their children’s behavior and help them overcome their problems successfully. Both schools and parents need to make sure that children feel protected and cared for and not allow them to suffer silently. Only an integrated approach to cyberbullying involving teachers, parents, and students can bring positive, long-term effects.</p><p></p><p>Ultimately, the way schools and parents combat cyberbullying will determine students’ safety and emotional well-being. Cyberbullying is a negative social trend that affects the most vulnerable and weak children, leading to psychological and psychosomatic problems, depression, anxiety, etc. Because this phenomenon is difficult to detect and prevent, it is extremely important to involve all stakeholders including teachers, families, and students. I am convinced that a collaborative approach to dealing with cyberbullies can reduce aggressive behavior and make children feel more protected, both at home and at school.</p><br />

                        <p>There is a big difference of cyber bullying and Cyber crime but Cyber crime can make kids who are being victimized through cyber bullying, it can feel like there is no escape from it due to technology being all around in the everyday life. As almost all can testify, one has been bullied at least once in their life, whether it was intentional or accidental; and more than likely one will proclaim that it took a toll on them in some way, shape, or form. Although that person may not have felt something even as serious as any disorder that is stress-related, but the victim more than likely at least felt down and had been somewhat haunted about the situation afterwards. Kids that are cyber bullied lose confidence in themselves and their eating and socializing patterns become thrown off. Another effect of cyber bullying is the disturbance in one’s sleep pattern; thus causing the victim to become clumsy and off balance. It has also been proven that cyber bullying can leave its victims with a bigger risk for depression, anxiety, and other stress-related dismays (New, 9); such as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, immune system suppression, and panic attacks. In the rare case, although its numbers have recently grown, some children have even turned to suicide due to the traumatic situation the person experienced with cyber bullying.</p><p>But there is also another difference due to real life and the internet, as for example Cyber Bullying, Cyber-bullying is a serious issue that pervades social and private lives of many teens making their existence depressive and sometimes leading to teen suicides.

Please mind that your essay will be tailored to comply with your particular request and will include all aspects you will mention in the description field. Find below the shortened sample of such essay to see how the topic might be presented and explored.  Cyber bullying is a multi-faced problem and definitions of this problem differ when made from the point of view of various disciplines. Yet the common features of all kinds of cyber bullying are as following: insulting or hurtful texts/images are sent directly to a victim over the cell phone/Internet or posted on the web for more people to participate in the process of humiliating the victim. In other words, a young person, usually a teen, is being bullied (humiliated, harassed, threatened, ridiculed etc.) by other young person by means of some digital technology, the latter being presented by a wide variety of tools and media. Adults can also use technology to harass or threaten other adults, yet this deviant behavior is called cyber-stalking and it should be assessed from a different angle.
A cyber-bully is usually portrayed as a wicked young person who found one more tool to exercise his/her desire to torment others.

The profile of a cyber-bully may partially explain why cyber-bullying takes place and what can be undertaken to stop it. However, the most valid explanation of cyber-bulling is that the Internet provided the additional tool for hurting others and ever-existing human aggression/pain sublimation/self-assertion migrated from the real world to the virtual space. Consequences of cyber-bulling for its victim are very serious, from depression and paranoia to suicide attempts. The seriousness of the problem explains why some US states introduce laws against cyber-bullying, but the problem is too broad and evasive to fight it by simply passing a bill.  And for the difference of those two they can actually harm you in many ways, but as you can see the difference is very see able and can't be fixed straight away but can be fixed. But you should always look out for those things because if you don't there can be serious consequences to it as being kill suicide or worse so if you feel any of those things go to someone who you think can help you with the problems you are having due to internet or real life.</p><br /><p>
