                                            Write a paragraph about the cause-and-effects of COVID-19. Use the details below and write them in correct format. Use a separate sheet for your answer.Employing a human rights lens in this analysis helps us translate needs and social problems into rights,focusing our attention on the broader sociopolitical structural context as the cause of the social problems.Human rights highlight the inherent dignity and worth of all people, who are the primary rights-holders.Governments (and other social actors, such as corporations) are the duty-bearers, and as such have theobligation to respect, protect, and fulfill human rights. Human rights cannot be separated from the societalcontexts in which they are recognized, claimed, enforced, and fulfilled. Specifically, social rights, whichinclude the right to health, can become important tools for advancing people’s citizenship and enhancingtheir ability to participate as active members of society. Such an understanding of social rights calls ourattention to the concept of equality, which requires that we place a greater emphasis on “solidarity” and the“collective.”We all have been affected by the current COVID-19 pandemic. However, the impact of the pandemic andits consequences are felt differently depending on our status as individuals and as members of society.While some try to adapt to working online, homeschooling their children and ordering food via Instacart,others have no choice but to be exposed to the virus while keeping society functioning. Our different socialidentities and the social groups we belong to determine our inclusion within society and, by extension, ourvulnerability to epidemics.Furthermore, in order to generate equality, solidarity, and social integration, the fulfillment of social rightsis not optional. In order to fulfill social integration, social policies need to reflect a commitment to respectand protect the most vulnerable individuals and to create the conditions for the fulfillment of economic andsocial rights for all.COVID-19 is killing people on a large scale. As of October 10, 2020, more than 7.7 million people acrossevery state in the United States and its four territories had tested positive for COVID-19. According to theNew York Times database, at least 213,876 people with the virus have died in the United States.[1]However, these alarming numbers give us only half of the picture; a closer look at data by different socialidentities (such as class, gender, age, race, and medical history) shows that minorities have beendisproportionally affected by the pandemic. These minorities in the United States are not having their rightto health fulfilled.</a>

                            29. Write a paragraph about the cause-and-effects of COVID-19. Use the details below and write them in correct format. Use a separate sheet for your answer.Employing a human rights lens in this analysis helps us translate needs and social problems into rights,focusing our attention on the broader sociopolitical structural context as the cause of the social problems.Human rights highlight the inherent dignity and worth of all people, who are the primary rights-holders.Governments (and other social actors, such as corporations) are the duty-bearers, and as such have theobligation to respect, protect, and fulfill human rights. Human rights cannot be separated from the societalcontexts in which they are recognized, claimed, enforced, and fulfilled. Specifically, social rights, whichinclude the right to health, can become important tools for advancing people’s citizenship and enhancingtheir ability to participate as active members of society. Such an understanding of social rights calls ourattention to the concept of equality, which requires that we place a greater emphasis on “solidarity” and the“collective.”We all have been affected by the current COVID-19 pandemic. However, the impact of the pandemic andits consequences are felt differently depending on our status as individuals and as members of society.While some try to adapt to working online, homeschooling their children and ordering food via Instacart,others have no choice but to be exposed to the virus while keeping society functioning. Our different socialidentities and the social groups we belong to determine our inclusion within society and, by extension, ourvulnerability to epidemics.Furthermore, in order to generate equality, solidarity, and social integration, the fulfillment of social rightsis not optional. In order to fulfill social integration, social policies need to reflect a commitment to respectand protect the most vulnerable individuals and to create the conditions for the fulfillment of economic andsocial rights for all.COVID-19 is killing people on a large scale. As of October 10, 2020, more than 7.7 million people acrossevery state in the United States and its four territories had tested positive for COVID-19. According to theNew York Times database, at least 213,876 people with the virus have died in the United States.[1]However, these alarming numbers give us only half of the picture; a closer look at data by different socialidentities (such as class, gender, age, race, and medical history) shows that minorities have beendisproportionally affected by the pandemic. These minorities in the United States are not having their rightto health fulfilled.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>    We investigate the relationship between media consumption, misinformation, and important attitudes and behaviours during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. We find that comparatively more misinformation circulates on Twitter, while news media tends to reinforce public health recommendations like social distancing. We find that exposure to social media is associated with misperceptions regarding basic facts about COVID-19 while the inverse is true for news media. These misperceptions are in turn associated with lower compliance with social distancing measures. We thus draw a clear link from misinformation circulating on social media, notably Twitter, to behaviours and attitudes that potentially magnify the scale and lethality of COVID-19.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>kapag tama paki BRAINLIEST po</p><br />
