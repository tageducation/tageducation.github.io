                                            I Am Proud to be A FilipinoToribia A. ManoI am a Filipino. I came from islands rippled with sunWhere days are green fires and nights are warmWith moon and stars. Girdling my loins is blood rich as milkFor I was born of sultans, rajahs, kings,Soldiers, heroes who fought to singThe poetry of freedom. My house is my landVirgin, brown, wombed out of loam, volcanic rock and shells,Carpeted with rice, corn, coconut, cane, treesThat rise as temples to grapple windsRains, mighty rivers furrowing the earth.Where I walk, my shadow is a marriage of flagsMalay, Chinese, Spanish, American, JapaneseWhile in my bones sleep quietly as a brideVanquished desires of conquerors who dreamt of empires,Gold, trade and spice. Though a paly breedI stand with the ancients for my love and loyaltyAre as fish to the sea. I am proud of my brownness,My duty and destiny are thirty-million brown menPlanting rice, husking coconut, throwing nets far into the PacificHacking mountains of iron, coal, chrome, manganese and timberTo live. We are one and the same. A moving, restless caravanOf dark brown skins building a holy heritage of democracyPiece by piece with our dreams, sweat and deathAs a bird builds patiently twig by twigThe warm, brown circle of its nest.I am a Filipino. I believe in the goodness and the bounty of God,I believe in the grandeur of charity and peace as a cure for the ills of manFor I am a Christian who looks upon all menAs brothers whose task it is to love.I believe in my country and in the deathlessness of my flagFor its every color is a history of courage, sacrifice, deathAgainst injustice, tyranny, oppression and hate.I believe in my people as noble keepers of the faith:That all men are equal; that all men are free.I believe with verdant and sprawling mountains, hills, valleys, plains,Lakes, waterfalls, rivers, sunsets, beachesAnd a generous sea. Alive, sovereign, wondrously happy in work andAbundant with hope for my people.I am proud to be a Filipino.LEARNING TASK 1After reading the poem, answer the following questions.

Are you both proud for the same reasons?I Am Proud to be A FilipinoToribia A. ManoI am a Filipino. I came from islands rippled with sunWhere days are green fires and nights are warmWith moon and stars. Girdling my loins is blood rich as milkFor I was born of sultans, rajahs, kings,Soldiers, heroes who fought to singThe poetry of freedom. My house is my landVirgin, brown, wombed out of loam, volcanic rock and shells,Carpeted with rice, corn, coconut, cane, treesThat rise as temples to grapple windsRains, mighty rivers furrowing the earth.Where I walk, my shadow is a marriage of flagsMalay, Chinese, Spanish, American, JapaneseWhile in my bones sleep quietly as a brideVanquished desires of conquerors who dreamt of empires,Gold, trade and spice. Though a paly breedI stand with the ancients for my love and loyaltyAre as fish to the sea. I am proud of my brownness,My duty and destiny are thirty-million brown menPlanting rice, husking coconut, throwing nets far into the PacificHacking mountains of iron, coal, chrome, manganese and timberTo live. We are one and the same. A moving, restless caravanOf dark brown skins building a holy heritage of democracyPiece by piece with our dreams, sweat and deathAs a bird builds patiently twig by twigThe warm, brown circle of its nest.I am a Filipino. I believe in the goodness and the bounty of God,I believe in the grandeur of charity and peace as a cure for the ills of manFor I am a Christian who looks upon all menAs brothers whose task it is to love.I believe in my country and in the deathlessness of my flagFor its every color is a history of courage, sacrifice, deathAgainst injustice, tyranny, oppression and hate.I believe in my people as noble keepers of the faith:That all men are equal; that all men are free.I believe with verdant and sprawling mountains, hills, valleys, plains,Lakes, waterfalls, rivers, sunsets, beachesAnd a generous sea. Alive, sovereign, wondrously happy in work andAbundant with hope for my people.I am proud to be a Filipino.Learning Task 1:After reading the poem, answer the following questions.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Islands are described in the poem as "rippled with sun, where days are green fires and with warm nights"It is true that these were done by many Filipinos in the past and there are until now, I agree, but we Filipinos have also improved and there are a lot of us now who are professionals in almost every work aspect.It is said in the poem that the cure for the ills of man is "grandeur of charity and peace". And yes, I agree with us helping one another and spreading peace all throughout, evil will surely subside.Yes, it is a responsibility, to walk chin up, full of confidence and to proudly say "I am a Filipino", when asked of race, to say that "I am dark-skinned, hardworking, and a <strong>FILIPI</strong><strong>NO</strong>, and I will always be proud of it", to show our appreciation and undying respect of our culture,country,and people.All of it still lives, except the fact that the number of people who willingly show these traits have decreased.<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>These answers contain my opinions, so feel free to change them...</p><p></p><p>Please do not that I am not a genius and that my answers are not 100% accurate...</p><p></p><p>#Goodluck!</p><p>#Carryonlearning</p><br />
