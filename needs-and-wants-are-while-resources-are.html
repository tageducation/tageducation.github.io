                                            Philippines is a semifeudal nation. Big business landlords and elites exploit the natural resources and the cheap serf-like labor of the country. This results in the displacement of families who then migrate to urban areas or to other countries to find a better living. It makes me wonder why the Canadian government only allows one family member to come to Canada if they need more people here. The Live-in Caregiver Program (LCP) is a program of the federal government allowing Canadians to import temporary migrant live-in caregivers, known around the world as domestic workers. If they complete the program, they can become Canadian citizens and sponsor their family through the reunification program. This takes an average of seven years, sometimes more. That’s a long time to be separated from your family. A long time spent taking care of the children of others, while your own need you at home. This aspect of the program causes damage to family relationships, one that affects the children deeply—this I can tell you from personal experience. Canadians need to be aware that we are part of this system. Not only here in Canada through our immigration policies, but also in the Philippines where Canadian imperialism contributes to forcedmigration. Part of our taxes goes to fund Canadian companies in the Philippines (especially in the mining sector), and Canadian military training of the Philippine armed forces to help protect those companies and forcefully displace Filipinos from the countryside through militarization. I want a Philippines with true democracy and true independence. I want justice for the marginalized and underrepresented. Today I am the Chairperson of Anakbayan-Toronto. We advocate for human rights, and we struggle for national industrialization that will keep Filipino families intact and ensure that no one will have to leave the country for a better life. I don’t want any child to suffer what I went through. Anakbayan-Toronto will not stop calling for national industrialization and genuine land reform in the Philippines, this is the only way that Filipinos will be able to work decent jobs, and not have to leave the country.1.

                                            I.Summarize the given text : Technology integration was the topic of this week’s chapter assignment. The chapter discussed two learning theories for a foundation to integration: Directed models and Constructivist models. The directed theory revolves around behavior and the processing of information. The constructivist theory deals with more of a “hands on” and social aspect approach. I would imagine most students at the early levels of learning are more visual and social learners taking more from experiences than a book. I guess it just depends on your beliefs and how you can best implement a strategy based upon your classroom. I personally feel that the classrooms in Piaget’s day were a lot less diverse than today’s. I think a teacher’s theory should be like a floating floor adjusting to its new room constantly. Integrating technology into a classroom can be very tedious and there are many things that teachers need to take under consideration. The (TIP) or Technology Integration Plan is a model that is used to “help teachers (especially those new to technology) plan for effective classroom uses of technology” (Roblyer &amp; Doering, 2010). I was pretty impressed with the model and how it went into detail with each of its phases. The phases are broken down easy with the teacher in mind. The first stage allows teachers to set learning goals for themselves. The next phase assists the teacher in deciding whether the lesson would be better with or without technology. I mean, it really breaks it down very well with each of its six stages. There is also a lot of information in books and online. I found a pretty cool article that discussed seven different ways teachers could integrate technology into the classroom. Create a clear vision of what a technological classroom looks like, build an on-campus and online learning network, and invest in yourself as a teacher. These are just a few things that will help in integrating technology into the classroom. The chapter discusses vital conditions to be present before and during integrating technology. Just as I have learned to create a clear vision of what a classroom integrated with technology looks like. It is also important to share your vision so that all levels of the school and district can properly plan for what will be needed. Policies have to be put in place to ensure safe and ethical use of the internet. There are so many things that can happen these days with viruses and hackers. You definitely would not want to have a parent file a lawsuit on you or the school for inappropriate matter on the internet. Schools also have to implement technical assistance and skilled personnel that would help mentor, train, coach, and model how the technology works. Unfortunately, that is one area where teachers are at a loss. The training department for teachers is not what it should be. Teachers are constantly taking training courses that are more like daily workshops. Technology should be set up differently because of the many facets that it entails. Finally, teaching strategies are the key to success. Teachers have to find an accurate and efficient way to teach and assess their students. I believe that once a teacher has many of these things in place the classroom will be transformed into a new, more advanced classroom; A classroom that works with the teacher and for the students. It is easy to see how fast technology is growing. It is a decision of the schools to decide what kind of technology program to implement. It is the schools responsibility to stick with the plan and back that plan so that it has the best chance for success. The teacher’s role is a vital one while integrating technology. They are the ones that will be using, teaching, and assessing students. There are several resources available to teachers outside of the school. Teachers who really want a classroom integrated with technology will have to work for it. There is a place for technology in every classroom around the world no matter the size. Resources Cheska, M.

All you have to do is read and understand thecontext below to find out. Are you ready? Let's start!The world where we live in is a place made up of both living (biotic) and non-living (abiotic) factors, which refer to the organisms that interact directly or indirectly.Organisms interact with one another in the ecosystem in order to receive theresources they need to survive. All organisms in an ecosystem are interdependent.Interdependence is the reliance of every life form on other organisms and theenvironment.Ecosystem can be as small as the community of insects living in a single treeor as large as the entire planet. While ecosystems appear very different from oneanother they all contain biotic and abiotic components. These components make upour ecosystem.Look around you. What do you see? Everything you see is part of ourecosystem. From the air that we breath, the swaying of trees caused by the wind, theburrowing worms in the soil, the hot temperature caused by the sun rays and thesplashing of water in a stream are some of the biotic and abiotic components in ourecosystem.Changes in the environment specifically in abiotic factors can disrupt thenatural balance in the ecosystem. Human interaction has been the cause of manychanges in the environment. That is why we need to take care of our environment tomaintain its ability to support varied forms of life.​</a>

                            17. Philippines is a semifeudal nation. Big business landlords and elites exploit the natural resources and the cheap serf-like labor of the country. This results in the displacement of families who then migrate to urban areas or to other countries to find a better living. It makes me wonder why the Canadian government only allows one family member to come to Canada if they need more people here. The Live-in Caregiver Program (LCP) is a program of the federal government allowing Canadians to import temporary migrant live-in caregivers, known around the world as domestic workers. If they complete the program, they can become Canadian citizens and sponsor their family through the reunification program. This takes an average of seven years, sometimes more. That’s a long time to be separated from your family. A long time spent taking care of the children of others, while your own need you at home. This aspect of the program causes damage to family relationships, one that affects the children deeply—this I can tell you from personal experience. Canadians need to be aware that we are part of this system. Not only here in Canada through our immigration policies, but also in the Philippines where Canadian imperialism contributes to forcedmigration. Part of our taxes goes to fund Canadian companies in the Philippines (especially in the mining sector), and Canadian military training of the Philippine armed forces to help protect those companies and forcefully displace Filipinos from the countryside through militarization. I want a Philippines with true democracy and true independence. I want justice for the marginalized and underrepresented. Today I am the Chairperson of Anakbayan-Toronto. We advocate for human rights, and we struggle for national industrialization that will keep Filipino families intact and ensure that no one will have to leave the country for a better life. I don’t want any child to suffer what I went through. Anakbayan-Toronto will not stop calling for national industrialization and genuine land reform in the Philippines, this is the only way that Filipinos will be able to work decent jobs, and not have to leave the country.1.

                            20. I.Summarize the given text : Technology integration was the topic of this week’s chapter assignment. The chapter discussed two learning theories for a foundation to integration: Directed models and Constructivist models. The directed theory revolves around behavior and the processing of information. The constructivist theory deals with more of a “hands on” and social aspect approach. I would imagine most students at the early levels of learning are more visual and social learners taking more from experiences than a book. I guess it just depends on your beliefs and how you can best implement a strategy based upon your classroom. I personally feel that the classrooms in Piaget’s day were a lot less diverse than today’s. I think a teacher’s theory should be like a floating floor adjusting to its new room constantly. Integrating technology into a classroom can be very tedious and there are many things that teachers need to take under consideration. The (TIP) or Technology Integration Plan is a model that is used to “help teachers (especially those new to technology) plan for effective classroom uses of technology” (Roblyer &amp; Doering, 2010). I was pretty impressed with the model and how it went into detail with each of its phases. The phases are broken down easy with the teacher in mind. The first stage allows teachers to set learning goals for themselves. The next phase assists the teacher in deciding whether the lesson would be better with or without technology. I mean, it really breaks it down very well with each of its six stages. There is also a lot of information in books and online. I found a pretty cool article that discussed seven different ways teachers could integrate technology into the classroom. Create a clear vision of what a technological classroom looks like, build an on-campus and online learning network, and invest in yourself as a teacher. These are just a few things that will help in integrating technology into the classroom. The chapter discusses vital conditions to be present before and during integrating technology. Just as I have learned to create a clear vision of what a classroom integrated with technology looks like. It is also important to share your vision so that all levels of the school and district can properly plan for what will be needed. Policies have to be put in place to ensure safe and ethical use of the internet. There are so many things that can happen these days with viruses and hackers. You definitely would not want to have a parent file a lawsuit on you or the school for inappropriate matter on the internet. Schools also have to implement technical assistance and skilled personnel that would help mentor, train, coach, and model how the technology works. Unfortunately, that is one area where teachers are at a loss. The training department for teachers is not what it should be. Teachers are constantly taking training courses that are more like daily workshops. Technology should be set up differently because of the many facets that it entails. Finally, teaching strategies are the key to success. Teachers have to find an accurate and efficient way to teach and assess their students. I believe that once a teacher has many of these things in place the classroom will be transformed into a new, more advanced classroom; A classroom that works with the teacher and for the students. It is easy to see how fast technology is growing. It is a decision of the schools to decide what kind of technology program to implement. It is the schools responsibility to stick with the plan and back that plan so that it has the best chance for success. The teacher’s role is a vital one while integrating technology. They are the ones that will be using, teaching, and assessing students. There are several resources available to teachers outside of the school. Teachers who really want a classroom integrated with technology will have to work for it. There is a place for technology in every classroom around the world no matter the size. Resources Cheska, M.

                            25. Hello there! I need your help. I want to find out the abiotic components presentin our ecosystem. Can you help me? All you have to do is read and understand thecontext below to find out. Are you ready? Let's start!The world where we live in is a place made up of both living (biotic) and non-living (abiotic) factors, which refer to the organisms that interact directly or indirectly.Organisms interact with one another in the ecosystem in order to receive theresources they need to survive. All organisms in an ecosystem are interdependent.Interdependence is the reliance of every life form on other organisms and theenvironment.Ecosystem can be as small as the community of insects living in a single treeor as large as the entire planet. While ecosystems appear very different from oneanother they all contain biotic and abiotic components. These components make upour ecosystem.Look around you. What do you see? Everything you see is part of ourecosystem. From the air that we breath, the swaying of trees caused by the wind, theburrowing worms in the soil, the hot temperature caused by the sun rays and thesplashing of water in a stream are some of the biotic and abiotic components in ourecosystem.Changes in the environment specifically in abiotic factors can disrupt thenatural balance in the ecosystem. Human interaction has been the cause of manychanges in the environment. That is why we need to take care of our environment tomaintain its ability to support varied forms of life.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>An abiotic factor is a non-living part of an ecosystem that shapes its environment. In a terrestrial ecosystem, examples might include temperature, light, and water. In a marine ecosystem, abiotic factors would include salinity and ocean currents.</p><p></p><br />
