pls pls pls i give brainliest and 5 stars best answer</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>1.The Indo-Aryans contributed to the culture of the Indian subcontinent by introducing the Vedic religion and culture, a system of social hierarchy and the caste system, and the Sanskrit language. The Vedic religion formed the core of later Hinduism, and the Sanskrit language provided the linguistic basis for many of the languages spoken today in the Indian subcontinent. The caste system, which established a hierarchy of social classes, was also a major part of the Indo-Aryan legacy and continues to influence Indian society to this day.</p><p></p><p>2.The period from 200 to 2100 CE is often referred to as the Golden Age of India because it was a time of great progress and prosperity in the region. During this period, India experienced a rapid growth in its economy and population, as well as advances in education, technology, culture, and science. Additionally, this period saw the rise of powerful Indian empires and dynasties, including the Maurya, Gupta, and Mughal Empires, which brought wealth and stability to the region. The Golden Age of India is a reminder of the country's rich and vibrant history.</p><p></p><p>3.The Mughal leaders were different from their predecessors in many ways. The Mughals adopted a more centralized form of government, with a strong emphasis on military power and a greater emphasis on administrative and bureaucratic systems. They also adopted a more tolerant attitude towards the Hindu population, allowing the practice of Hindu religious and social customs. Additionally, the Mughals initiated a period of great cultural and artistic accomplishment, especially in the areas of literature, art, architecture, and music. They developed a distinct Mughal style of architecture and paintings that was a synthesis of Persian, Indian, and Islamic cultural influences.</p><p></p><p>4.1. He implemented a policy of religious tolerance, allowing all religions to be practiced in his empire.</p><p></p><p>2. He established an extensive network of roads, waterways, and rest-houses to promote trade and travel throughout his empire.</p><p></p><p>3. He created the first unified system of coins and weights and measures, helping to promote economic stability.</p><p></p><p>5.1. The Gupta Empire achieved significant advances in science and mathematics, including the invention of the decimal system and the concept of zero. They also developed the use of Sanskrit as a language of literature and established a system of Hindu Law.</p><p></p><p>2. The Gupta Empire made significant advances in the fields of art and architecture, including the development of stupas and temples in a distinct style. They also made advances in sculpture, painting and literature.</p><p></p><p>3. The Gupta Empire established strong diplomatic ties with other empires and kingdoms, including the Romans and the Chinese. They also formed trade links with the Silk Road and the Indian Ocean.</p><br />

                        <p>5.B</p><p>6.C</p><p>7.D</p><p>8.A</p><p>9.B</p><p>10.C</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Electronic products, transport equipment, precious metals, oils, and fruits – these are some of the Philippines’ primary export. Despite the high dollar value that each of these contributes, none of them are considered the country’s top export. The country’s top and most successful export has been and will continue to be its people. Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs) or those from the Philippines who work abroad are regarded as the modern heroes of the country not just because of the sacrifice they make to lift their families out of poverty and better their economic status. They are also known to be the biggest export earners and among the largest contributors to the growth of the Philippine economy.</p><p></p><p>OFWs aid the country’s economy through their remittances or the portion of their salary that they send to their loved ones in the Philippines. All the money is sent through the international banking system and is immediately recorded in the country’s balance of payments. Once the money gets into the country and in the hands of the intended receiver, it then starts to impact the national economy. There are many ways remittances influence the economy, but the most noticeable and desirable one is its contribution to the rising living standards in the country.</p><p></p><p>Families who receive money from relatives who work abroad are given more purchasing power, which then improves domestic consumption – one of the key factors in the growth of the economy. Although most OFWs send money so that their families can maintain a certain standard of living, there are families that have sources of domestic income and use remittances solely for the improvement of their lives. They put the money into investments, home improvements, and high-quality education. Simply put, a lot of opportunities are opened for these families due solely to the remittances.</p><p></p><p>People from the Philippines who work abroad are deemed heroes because of their contributions to both their families and the economy. They are highly commended for what they do and put on a pedestal by some, which is why so many desire to become OFWs. There is, however, more to being an OFW that people don’t know about and that’s exactly what we aim to shed some light on today.
