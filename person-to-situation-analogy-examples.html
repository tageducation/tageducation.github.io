Different strokes for different folks, is how some CEOs (chief executive officers) describe their management approach. Ricardo B. Aguas, Jr., Vice-President for Operations at Selecta Dairy Products, believes in situational leadership. He names his four styles in dealing with people as directing, coaching, supporting and delegating. For example, if there is a motivated person who lacks the competence to do the work, he directs and gives instructions. For efficient coaching, he empowers the workers to build their competence and confidence and energizes them to work. Then, if there is a competent person, but he is not confident enough nor does he know how to implement a project, Aguas supports him by further discussion and preparation as the worker approaches a problem on his own. To those who are motivated and know what to do, Aguas delegates the work, spelling out the desired results, accountability, consequences, and resources. Because workers have different strengths and weaknesses, Aguas believes that the key to successful management is knowing one's people.</a>

                                            LESSON PROPER Analogy is a pair of terms that has common relationship. In most cases, you will not only determine the common relationship between each pair, but you will also have to identify which term makes up each pair. Usually, you are given two terms in the format A: B which could be read as related A TB. Example: (A) (B) kitchen: house- Kitchen and House are related since kitchen is part of the house. Writers use analogy to connect unfamiliar words or new ideas with common and familiar objects. It functions as description or explanation of one thing by examining its similarities and differences and forces the reader to understand the connection between them. Types of Relationships in Analogy These are the seven common types of relationships in analogy: 1. Part to Whole A relationship in analogy in which one term is part of the other term. Example: Eyes: face (The eyes are part of the face) 2. Cause and Effect A relationship in analogy in which one term is the result of the other term. Example: she wanted to buy a dress: she went to the mall (She wanted to buy a dress, so she went to the mall.) 3. Person to Situation A relationship in analogy in which one term is the workplace of the other. Example: saleslady: mall (A saleslady works in a mall.) 4. Synonym A relationship in analogy in which both terms have the same meaning. Example: little: small (Both terms mean the same) 5. Antonym A relationship in analogy in which terms are opposite in meaning. Example: elegant: unattractive (The words have opposite meaning.)​</a>

                            10. LESSON PROPER Analogy is a pair of terms that has common relationship. In most cases, you will not only determine the common relationship between each pair, but you will also have to identify which term makes up each pair. Usually, you are given two terms in the format A: B which could be read as related A TB. Example: (A) (B) kitchen: house- Kitchen and House are related since kitchen is part of the house. Writers use analogy to connect unfamiliar words or new ideas with common and familiar objects. It functions as description or explanation of one thing by examining its similarities and differences and forces the reader to understand the connection between them. Types of Relationships in Analogy These are the seven common types of relationships in analogy: 1. Part to Whole A relationship in analogy in which one term is part of the other term. Example: Eyes: face (The eyes are part of the face) 2. Cause and Effect A relationship in analogy in which one term is the result of the other term. Example: she wanted to buy a dress: she went to the mall (She wanted to buy a dress, so she went to the mall.) 3. Person to Situation A relationship in analogy in which one term is the workplace of the other. Example: saleslady: mall (A saleslady works in a mall.) 4. Synonym A relationship in analogy in which both terms have the same meaning. Example: little: small (Both terms mean the same) 5. Antonym A relationship in analogy in which terms are opposite in meaning. Example: elegant: unattractive (The words have opposite meaning.)​</h2><br />
