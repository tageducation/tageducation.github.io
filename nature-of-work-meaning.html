Then, answer the questions that followThe Value of WorkEverything has value no matter howsignificant or simple it is.At the mere mention of work, one immediately connects with it the idea of toil and fatigue which pertains to a slave who overdoes things in a difficult manner. Everything in this world involves work.In what light should work be viewed? Anything that comes from something done is achieved by means of labor and work. It is of two-fold nature, either mental or physical. Both are indispensable to the well-being of human society. Our attention is directed towards physical labor.Christianity teaches us to regard work as something sacred and honorable Work is duty. You must not only work highly, you must also love it heartly. Without it, order and cleanliness can never exist in the house. State of affairs would be a mess and discomfort prevailsPeople who work and are kept busy have no time for hanging around, gossiping, or being with bad company. Women who are fond of work are more virtuous and pure. There is no dull moment in their lives, there is so much to gain when they are physically preoccupied.Be proud, therefore, and love your work. Do it diligently and make your best. Treat it as an inseparable friend. Whatever the nature of your work may be, do it with care and industry. If it is a domestic chore, do not find fault and make critical remarks, but put your hand to everything.If your work is to be really done well, if it is to gain merit for yourself, perform it with good intention. Yes, be patient, for without patience, no labor, no toil or work can be meritorious in the eyes of Someone above.----------------------------------------------These lines speak well of this: Swiftly time speeds on its way See that thou use it well. Let each hour of everyday Be a tale of wisdom to tell.Summary of the text:​​​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Personal protective equipment, commonly referred to as “PPE”, is equipment worn to minimize exposure to a variety of hazards. Examples of PPE include such items as gloves, foot and eye protection, protective hearing devices (earplugs, muffs) hard hats, respirators and full body suits.</p><p></p><p>2.

Hazard substitution is a hazard control strategy in which a material or process is replaced with another that is less hazardous.</p><p></p><p>4. Hazard elimination is a hazard control strategy based on completely removing a material or process causing a hazard. Elimination is the most effective of the five members of the hierarchy of hazard controls in protecting workers, and where possible should be implemented before all other control methods.</p><p></p><p>5. According to the World Health Organization, about 80% of the hospital wastes produced by health care activities are general wastes. The remaining 20% of these hospital wastes are considered to be biohazard waste.</p><p></p><p>6.Engineering controls are methods that are built into the design of a plant, equipment or process to minimize the hazard. Engineering controls are a very reliable way to control worker exposures as long as the controls are designed, used and maintained properly.</p><p></p><p>7. Administrative controls are training, procedure, policy, or shift designs that lessen the threat of a hazard to an individual. Administrative controls typically change the behavior of people (e.g., factory workers) rather than removing the actual hazard or providing personal protective equipment (PPE).</p><p></p><p>8.

Biological hazard, ... psychological hazards, ergonomic hazards.</p><p></p><p>10. The circulatory system is made up of blood vessels that carry blood away from and towards the heart. Arteries carry blood away from the heart and veins carry blood back to the heart. The circulatory system carries oxygen, nutrients, and hormones to cells, and removes waste products, like carbon dioxide.</p><br />
