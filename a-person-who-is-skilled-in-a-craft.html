                                            "give a title for this"Entrepreneurs are high-energy creative people, who are self-confident, have high levels of self-esteemand are futuristic in their outlook as theyseek to incessantly solve problems, take risks, and learn from failures(theirs and others). They thrive on change and have a natural predisposition to show initiative and willinglyaccept personal responsibility for projects. They harness all available resources within their scope in order toachieve success on their own terms.Successful entrepreneurs learn to control and discipline their gift and by combining this with a businesseducation (both formal and from the “school of hard knocks”) together with a perseverance and an enjoyment ofhard work. Driven by a righteous passion, they eventually craft their success in spite of the many precedingdisappointments and setbacks.Many people have tried unsuccessfully to categorize the entrepreneur, with the Webster's dictionarydescribing them as "one who organizes, manages, and assumes the risks of a business or enterprise.” This is atypical researcher's description, written without the privileged insight into the mind and spirit of what makes anentrepreneur tick.Entrepreneurial skill-set would afford success in many fields of human endeavor; however, theentrepreneur is drawn to the world of business and commerce. This is because their great desire forindependence, their love of a competitive environment, the business world's reward for objectivity oversubjectivity, and the fact that excelling at this core societal realm makes the greatest use of their talent.However, sharing this “money accumulating" space in society are other players, with some like thescammers and value takers, whose view of success is so focused on just the money that they are quite prepared,if necessary, to sell both their integrity and their grandmother in order to have it. As you will see, while boththis particular acumen and the entrepreneur's methodology share the same "money accumulating' outcome,each achieves it with an entirely different mindset and approach. Entrepreneurs "make money," meaning theycreate value that did not previously exist rather than just accumulating money via schemes and exploitingweaknesses that take from another's hard-earned assets.​</a>

                            18. "give a title for this"Entrepreneurs are high-energy creative people, who are self-confident, have high levels of self-esteemand are futuristic in their outlook as theyseek to incessantly solve problems, take risks, and learn from failures(theirs and others). They thrive on change and have a natural predisposition to show initiative and willinglyaccept personal responsibility for projects. They harness all available resources within their scope in order toachieve success on their own terms.Successful entrepreneurs learn to control and discipline their gift and by combining this with a businesseducation (both formal and from the “school of hard knocks”) together with a perseverance and an enjoyment ofhard work. Driven by a righteous passion, they eventually craft their success in spite of the many precedingdisappointments and setbacks.Many people have tried unsuccessfully to categorize the entrepreneur, with the Webster's dictionarydescribing them as "one who organizes, manages, and assumes the risks of a business or enterprise.” This is atypical researcher's description, written without the privileged insight into the mind and spirit of what makes anentrepreneur tick.Entrepreneurial skill-set would afford success in many fields of human endeavor; however, theentrepreneur is drawn to the world of business and commerce. This is because their great desire forindependence, their love of a competitive environment, the business world's reward for objectivity oversubjectivity, and the fact that excelling at this core societal realm makes the greatest use of their talent.However, sharing this “money accumulating" space in society are other players, with some like thescammers and value takers, whose view of success is so focused on just the money that they are quite prepared,if necessary, to sell both their integrity and their grandmother in order to have it. As you will see, while boththis particular acumen and the entrepreneur's methodology share the same "money accumulating' outcome,each achieves it with an entirely different mindset and approach. Entrepreneurs "make money," meaning theycreate value that did not previously exist rather than just accumulating money via schemes and exploitingweaknesses that take from another's hard-earned assets.​</h2><br />
