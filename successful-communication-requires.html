the receiver perceive it in the same way?
2. Communication contexts include intrapersonal, interpersonal, group, public, and mass
communication that enable us to use the most appropriate way of communicating in order to get
your message across.
3. Effective communication includes active listening. Hence, choosing our words carefully and
matching them with our body language is of little vitality.
4. In public communication, nonverbal feedback is limited, verbal feedback is more reliable.
5. Dialogue involves a friendly relationship. Conversation involved a sustained relationship.
6. An example of Small Group Interpersonal Context is when you are participating in an
organizational meeting which aims to address the concerns of your students.
8. Interpersonal Communication is a type of communication between and among people and
establishes personal relationships. This type of communication normally involves only two people
and should not range from intimate and very personal to formal and impersonal.
9. Public Communication refers to communication that requires you to deliver or send the
message before an audience. Messages can be driven by informational or persuasive purposes.
10. Speech contextualization is about how meaning is affected depending on the social situation
wherein the speech is delivered.</a>

The need for cultural awareness is a major impact of globalization on the required skillset of effective communicators.
Virtual interactions have always been an important factor of success in business.
In a globalized world, effective communication is a necessity.
The first step in achieving effective communication is to know your location.
Globalization has introduced virtual communication and collaboration as a major part of workplace dynamics.
Awareness of communication differences in a body language can be just as important as the nuances of speech.
Conceptually, “communication” is another way of describing the technological space at the interface of economic globalization and cultural globalization.
The global policy framework for communication is therefore emerging as a key structural component of the emerging global governance framework in general.
Communicating with your customers, your suppliers, your stockholders, and many other stakeholders all factor into the global equation.
Ancient entrepreneurs need to understand the strengths and limitations of different communications media, and how to use each medium to maximum effect.
People who are accustomed to communicating in groups in virtual settings can find themselves lost, confused or unable to share their input.
Even when two people are speaking the same language, cultural differences can affect vocabulary, colloquial expressions, voice tone and taboo topics.
Affecting the true meaning of global communications would be the intercultural factor.
Global Communication is not only the interaction between two employees within your organization.</a>

                            7. Which of the following statements is NOT TRUE? Non-verbal communication does not complement verbal communication. Communication requires a speaker and a listener who ideally should be individuals who share a commonness of experience. Communication comes in varied forms and patterns depending on the given situation. Success in communication depends largely on the perfect chemistry between the sender and the listener.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Let us take a look at all of the statements before we decide which one is not true. This is going to help us understand communication on a deeper level.</p><p>1. <strong>Non-verbal communication does not complement verbal communication.</strong></p><p>Verbal communication or speech is truly the most obvious form of transmitting information. However, it is not always enough. Non-verbal communication, which comes in the form of body language, gestures, movements and more, is also a valid way to convey feelings and information. The two of them should be used together whenever possible to most effectively deliver what we want to say.</p><p>2. <strong>Communication requires a speaker and a listener who ideally should be individuals who share a commonness of experience.</strong></p><p>A speaker and a listener are both required in order to have communication. It is not a one-way street because it involves relaying information or feelings from one person to another. You cannot call it communication if there is only one party involved in the exchange.</p><p>3. <strong>Communication comes in varied forms and patterns depending on the given situation.</strong></p><p>Ultimately, there is more than just one way to communicate. It is wrong to think that there is a single template that will lead to successful communication. Different situations call for different actions and modes. The context is necessary before we decide on the best way to convey what we think or feel. Every interaction is going to be different for this reason.</p><p>4. <strong>Success in communication depends largely on the perfect chemistry between the sender and the listener.</strong></p><p>The sender and the listener must both be active participants in a conversation or exchange to ensure successful communication. While chemistry is not the only thing that determines the success of an exchange, it is a big factor. If there is no chemistry between two participants, there is a good chance that it will result in communication breakdown.</p><p></p><p>Based on my assessment, the correct answer is the first one. It is <strong>NOT TRUE</strong> that "Non-verbal communication does not complement verbal communication." These two modes go hand in hand when it comes to conveying our thoughts and feelings. Non-verbal communication is helpful and can enhance our verbal communication. The rest of the statements are correct, so this is the only possible answer in my opinion.</p><p>#BRAINLYFAST</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>What exactly do we mean when we say 'non-verbal communication'?

                            12. True or False
The need for cultural awareness is a major impact of globalization on the required skillset of effective communicators.
Virtual interactions have always been an important factor of success in business.
In a globalized world, effective communication is a necessity.
The first step in achieving effective communication is to know your location.
Globalization has introduced virtual communication and collaboration as a major part of workplace dynamics.
Awareness of communication differences in a body language can be just as important as the nuances of speech.
Conceptually, “communication” is another way of describing the technological space at the interface of economic globalization and cultural globalization.
The global policy framework for communication is therefore emerging as a key structural component of the emerging global governance framework in general.
Communicating with your customers, your suppliers, your stockholders, and many other stakeholders all factor into the global equation.
Ancient entrepreneurs need to understand the strengths and limitations of different communications media, and how to use each medium to maximum effect.
People who are accustomed to communicating in groups in virtual settings can find themselves lost, confused or unable to share their input.
Even when two people are speaking the same language, cultural differences can affect vocabulary, colloquial expressions, voice tone and taboo topics.
Affecting the true meaning of global communications would be the intercultural factor.
Global Communication is not only the interaction between two employees within your organization.</h2><br />
