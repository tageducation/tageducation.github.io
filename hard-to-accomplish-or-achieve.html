                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>need Lang po </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>need Lang po</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Be confident and positive</p><p>— This is the backbone for all the other tips to reach your dreams. The more positive you are, the more you are open to opportunities and success. Law of Attraction states that whatever you put out comes back to you — so as you see the best in things and as you think highly of yourself, you begin to attract the people and situations into your life that will lead you to what you want. Think about it: when you are feeling down and frustrated, you probably aren’t very clear, focused or connected. You may be looking at the ground worrying, instead of making eye contact and striking up a wonderful conversation that might just change your life. Happy, successful people surround themselves with other happy people. So be confident, be positive and appreciate the little things as well as the big.</p><p></p><p>2. Focus forward &amp; visualize your dream</p><p>— It can be all too easy to see how far you have to go and feel discouraged. Especially when you have inevitable setbacks. This is why it is so important to focus forward and visualize your dreams every day. Likely, your dreams won’t materialize overnight. But if you focus forward, and can see your dream in your mind before it happens, then your sub-conscious knows what to move toward. As you focus forward, imagine beautiful opportunities appearing before you. Imagine how good you feel living your dream life. Allow yourself to bask in this feeling and delight in the desire of what you want. As you do this, you are more open to receive goodness and your dreams will quickly begin to materialize. It can be extremely helpful to keep an appreciation journal, where you write down your dreams and goals in present tense. The whole point is to connect with how you will feel in your ideal future so you are feeling it Now. If you can do this, then you are half way there because you already feel great! You will raise your vibration closer to the vibration of your dreams. You will be confident and more positive, which makes you able to take inspired action that make your dreams come true!</p><p></p><p>3. Make every step fun</p><p>— So many of us have been taught that with enough hard work anything is possible. But this idea leaves out something very important: the people who truly reach their dreams, especially in the biggest ways, have fun along the way. If you do what feels good then you will feel happier. When you feel happier, you are more inspired. Find what makes you feel good and focus on it, because feeling happy and inspired every step of the way is key. As you let go of the old belief that success has to be hard, you see life becomes happier and easier. You won’t need will power because you are driven with happy inspiration and you will be excited to get the next step of your work done! As you make fun and happiness a priority, you will notice wonderful shifts, and creating your dreams in very big ways will become easier than you were ever led to believe.</p><p></p><p>4. Break down your plans into little pieces</p><p>— Big dreams can be quite overwhelming in the early days. There is usually so much work to be done it can be overwhelming! By breaking it down into little pieces, you avoid becoming derailed before you even begin. Grab a pen or your computer and write down your desire. Then write what needs to be done. These are your topics. Once you have your list of topics, go another step further and break them down again. These little sub-headings are the tasks that need to be completed. For instance, if you are wanting to publish a book, a topic might be to ‘Find cover art’. The tasks might be to come up with concept, contact illustrators, send them samples of your writing, etc. Each one of these tasks is little. Even if you only do one or two a day, you can feel positive that you are going in the right direction step by step.</p><p></p><p>5. Don't listen to negative people</p><p>— Often when positive people have big dreams, others will try to pull them down. They might warn you and say you’re wasting your time or there won’t be any jobs. The same old story, really. People have been holding themselves back because they don’t believe in themselves. Don’t to listen to them! If you feel in your heart your dream is possible and you want to achieve it – then you CAN have it. Remember, the universe has limitless abundance available for all. It will always deliver to those who believe in their dream so much they feel it before it physically exists. This is a fundamental principal in Law of Attraction. Keep your dream alive and don’t listen to those who think it can’t be done. There are clearly hundreds and thousands of examples of people succeeding and making their dreams happen, seemingly against all odds. These are the people you want to be listening to.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>hope it helps.</p><br />

Possibility, in logic and metaphysics, one of the fundamental modalities involved in the explication of the opposition between necessity and contingency. In logic, possibility implies the absence of a contradiction. Such definitions as “The possible is that which either is or will be true” and “that which is not prevented by anything from happening even if it does not happen” were current in Hellenistic Greece. According to Aristotle, possibility is to be understood in relation to necessity: whereas a necessary proposition predicates something of a thing’s essence (as in “All humans are mortal”), a possible proposition predicates something of a thing that is merely accidental (as in “Some humans are tall”). Some philosophers have held that possible things or states of affairs are simply those whose conception involves no contradiction. To determine the empirical possibility of a thing, according to Immanuel Kant (1724–1804), it must be ascertained whether the nature of the thing in question conforms to the conditions of actual experience. The American philosopher David Lewis (1941–2001) held that there are possible but nonactual things, the largest of which are nonactual worlds. </p><p></p><p>4.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.Obstacles or limitations are those things that you have dealt with or are dealing with in your life, or they may suddenly come upon you as if by accident or because of a change in circumstances.</p><p></p><p>2.You do not love (or sometimes even like) everyone you are supposed to serve. You will not be able to save everyone. There is never enough time. There will always be things about your work and the people you work with that cause a strong emotional reaction.</p><p></p><p>3.But of course, we have to face the possible limitations as well, such as financial capabilities, physical limitations and environmental factors. Money, for example, might not be a factor when trying to invent something, but when you are already filing for a patent, it can be a problem</p><p></p><p>4.In 10 years, I see myself leading a team. I want to learn all that I can about this role first and advance my skills to earn that kind of position. I'm happy to start in this role and get to know the team and process well and then start to have more responsibilities.</p><p></p><p>5.It's just about extending your own limits, going above and beyond the little box that you created for yourself. Even if something has not been done before, that does not mean it cannot be done. History is full of first times, when someone decided that something impossible can be done and did it.</p><br />
