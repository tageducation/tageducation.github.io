She may have won the battle against men for equal opportunity; but, she has lost and forgotten the spirit that drove her to win the battle. She can hardly recognize herself, perhaps, who she had been, as an individual who once had an underrated self-image. But declining economy remains clear to her.Now, her true objective in her display of deliberate obsession to fair in the formerly man’s world then needs disambiguation. Did she fight for self-actualization because she wanted to pursue a career in the field of her choice or, did she fight for the inadequacies of men in her family that cripple its function? Her present actions seemingly prove her presence for the latter. Perhaps she thinks of herself as messiah, and uses the same strength and freedom that she has acquired from her battle for equality to save and rescue her family. She has become indifferent to her needs againcaged, caged in her pretense. She flaunts her strength, her talents, her unwavering confidence; she uses her resources and takes responsibility of her family; she exercises her freedom to penetrate fields she can be good at; she works hard for others and forgets about her own self, again.

                            9. Every Filipina is a source of endless possibilities. Her person embraces
the roles of responsible daughter, steadfast sister, generous aunt, indifferent
employee, consistent ex-lover, bill settler, a person who knows exactly how-to
uncomplicated matters for each member of the family; yet, she knows not how
to identify what she has long wanted for herself. She may have won the battle
against men for equal opportunity; but she has lost and forgotten the spirit that
drove her to win the battle. She can hardly recognize herself, perhaps, who
she had been, as an individual who once had an underrated self-image. But
declining economy remains clear to her.Now, her true objective in her display of deliberate obsession to fair inthe formerly man’s world then needs disambiguation. Did she fight for selfactualization because she wanted to pursue a career in the field of her choiceor, did she fight for the inadequacies of men in her family that cripple its
function? Her present actions seemingly prove her presence for the latter.Perhaps she thinks of herself as messiah, and uses the same strength andfreedom that she has acquired from her battle for equality to save and rescueher family. She has become indifferent to her needs again- caged, caged inher pretense. She flaunts her strength, her talents, her unwaveringconfidence; she uses her resources and takes responsibility of her family; sheexercises her freedom to penetrate fields she can be good at; she works hardfor others and forgets about her own self, again. She has turned into an unimaginably powerful person, who does everything she can possibly think ofand defies anyone who challenges her otherwise.She is the spirit who overshadows even the real person within herself.She has enough compassion for her family; yet, she has not left any forherself.
