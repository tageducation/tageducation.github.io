Food costs can make or break a business.</p><p></p><p>There's a reason why the restaurant failure rate is so high.</p><p></p><p>Whether you run a 50-seat metropolitan martini bar or a small mom-and-pop diner, knowing and controlling this cost will keep your business going. To ensure accuracy, restaurant owners and bar managers need to know how to take inventory.</p><p></p><p>You don't want to let your costs get out of control because you didn't calculate things properly. We'll help you understand the purpose of calculating food cost and the steps involved.</p><p></p><p>Food Cost: What Is It?</p><p>Food cost is the ratio of ingredient cost to revenue generated from food sales using those ingredients. This metric is always displayed as a percentage. Food cost provides insight into a restaurant or bar's profitability.</p><p></p><p>This number is used to establish prices and helps set the tone and quality of a business. Looking at this cost and optimizing the return on each dish can turn a floundering business into a profitable one.</p><p></p><p>Why Is Food Cost Important?</p><p>Maintaining the proper food cost ratio will help you price your items correctly and maximize profit. Tracking cost will also allow you to react to changes in restaurant sales and adjust pricing (psychological pricing, anyone?), ordering, and offerings on the fly. Knowing your business's actual cost percentage is necessary for this.</p><p></p><p>Profit margins are thin in the restaurant industry. Staying on top of cost is imperative. The best way to do this is to take inventory often and minimize inventory shrinkage. You can take inventory quickly and easily using bar inventory software.</p><br />
