                                            Nowadays, more and more people are affected by health issues such as diabetes and heart disease which are linked to overconsumption of cheap, mass-production food. Some people believe the only solution is to make fast food less affordable by taxing it highly. Despite the severity of the problem, I think this is quite wrong. Increasing the tax on fast food would unfairly penalize people and may not necessarily bring about the desired health benefits First, fast food is about more than just nutrition. Many teenagers spend money on fast food not because they need to eat out but because this is how they socialize. Fast-food restaurants provide a safe, convenient place for young people to meet friends. For another group, low-income families, fast food can provide an inexpensive treat for children. Denying people, a small pleasure in life could affect their social lives or happiness. Another important point is that if the reason for taxing fast food is to reduce obesity, it may be ineffective. It is true that fast food is high in sugar, salt and fat, all of which cause weight gain and are detrimental to our health. However, we also know that there are other factors which contribute to the risk of obesity, such as lack of exercise and inappropriate portion size. While home-cooked food is generally healthy, this is not always the case. I personally know a family that used to eat high-fat, home-cooked food in enormous portions. They all suffered from health problems due to obesity. On the other hand, I do understand the point of view of those who say drastic action is needed. If fast food were taxed and became expensive, people would be forced to seek out healthier options. In addition, food producers would have an incentive to provide healthier foods. However, there is likely to be resistance from consumers and producers who want to have a wider choice. To conclude, although imposing a higher tax on fast food could have some positive effects, these would be outweighed by the drawbacks. For one thing, some sectors of society would feel victimized, and there is also the fact that simply raising tax would not result in a much healthier society. What we really need is greater awareness of diet and cheaper healthy food. Pick Out The Opinion Marking Signals.​</a>

                                            Nowadays, more and more people are affected by health issues such as diabetes and heart disease which are linked to overconsumption of cheap, mass-production food. Some people believe the only solution is to make fast food less affordable by taxing it highly. Despite the severity of the problem, I think this is quite wrong. Increasing the tax on fast food would unfairly penalize people and may not necessarily bring about the desired health benefits First, fast food is about more than just nutrition. Many teenagers spend money on fast food not because they need to eat out but because this is how they socialize. Fast-food restaurants provide a safe, convenient place for young people to meet friends. For another group, low-income families, fast food can provide an inexpensive treat for children. Denying people, a small pleasure in life could affect their social lives or happiness. Another important point is that if the reason for taxing fast food is to reduce obesity, it may be ineffective. It is true that fast food is high in sugar, salt and fat, all of which cause weight gain and are detrimental to our health. However, we also know that there are other factors which contribute to the risk of obesity, such as lack of exercise and inappropriate portion size. While home-cooked food is generally healthy, this is not always the case. I personally know a family that used to eat high-fat, home-cooked food in enormous portions. They all suffered from health problems due to obesity. On the other hand, I do understand the point of view of those who say drastic action is needed. If fast food were taxed and became expensive, people would be forced to seek out healthier options. In addition, food producers would have an incentive to provide healthier foods. However, there is likely to be resistance from consumers and producers who want to have a wider choice. To conclude, although imposing a higher tax on fast food could have some positive effects, these would be outweighed by the drawbacks. For one thing, some sectors of society would feel victimized, and there is also the fact that simply raising tax would not result in a much healthier society. What we really need is greater awareness of diet and cheaper healthy food. Pick Out The Opinion Marking Signals.​</a>

In this selection will find out the problems met by the author in his desire to improve his community you you Activity 4: Identification Directions Read the selection carefully. Afterwards, identify the problems/issues met by the author in his desire to improve his community by listing down the issues in the table provided then put a label what issue is it Sanitary Reform and Famine Relief by: M.K. Gandhi It has always been possible for me to reconcile myself to any one member of the body politic remaining out of use. I have always been loathe to hide or connive at the weak points of the community or to press for its rights without having purged it of its blemishes Therefore, ever since my settlement in Natal. I had been endeavoring to clear the community of a charge that had been leveled against it, not without a certain amount of truth The charge had often been made that the Indian was slovenly in his habits and did not keep his house and surroundings clean. The principal men of the community had, therefore, already begun to put their house in order, but house-to-house inspection was undertaken only when plague was reported to be imminent in Durban. This was done after consulting, and gaining the approval of the city fathers, who had desired our cooperation Our cooperation made work easier for them and at the same time lessened our hardships. For whenever there is an outbreak of epidemics, the executive, as a general rule, get impatient, take excessive measures and behave to such as may have incurred their displeasure with a heavy hand. The community saved itself from this oppression by voluntarily taking sanitary measures But I had some bitter experiences. I saw that I could not so easily count on the help of the community in getting it to do its own duty, as I could in claiming for its rights At some places I met with insults, at others with polite indifference. It was too much for people to bestir themselves to keep their surroundings clean Toe expect them to find money for the work was out of the question. These experiences taught me better than ever before, that without infinite patience it was impossible to get the people to do any work. It is the reformer who is anxious for the reform, and not the society, from which he should expect nothing better than opposition, abhorrence and even moral persecution Why may not society regard as retrogression what the reformers holds dear as life itself? Nevertheless, the result of this agitation was that Indian community learnt to recognize more or less the necessity for keeping their house and environments clean I gained the esteem of the authorities. They saw that, though I had made it my business to ventilate grievances and press rights, I was no less keen and insistent upon self-purification There was one thing, however, which still remained to be done, namely, the awakening in the Indian settler of a sense of duty to the motherland India was poor the Indian settler went to South Africa in search of wealth, and he was bound to contribute part off his earnings for the benefit of his countrymen in the hour of their adversity. This the settler did during the terrible famines of 1897 and 1899. They contributed handsomely for famine relief, and more so in 1899 than 1897 We had appealed to Englishmen also for funds, and they had responded well. Even the indentured Indians gave their share to the contribution, and the system inaugurated at the time of these families had been continued ever since, and we know that Indians in South Africa never fail to send handsome contribution to India in times of national calamity Thus, service of the Indians in South Africa ever revealed to me new implications of truth in every stage Truth is like a vast tree, which yields more and more fruit, the more you nurture it. The deeper the search in the mine of truth, he richer the discovery of the gems buried there, in the shape of openings for an ever greater variety of service.

                                            Nowadays, more and more people are affected by health issues such as diabetes and heart disease which are linked to overconsumption of cheap, mass-production food. Some people believe the only solution is to make fast food less affordable by taxing it highly. Despite the severity of the problem, I think this is quite wrong. Increasing the tax on fast food would unfairly penalize people and may not necessarily bring about the desired health benefits First, fast food is about more than just nutrition. Many teenagers spend money on fast food not because they need to eat out but because this is how they socialize. Fast-food restaurants provide a safe, convenient place for young people to meet friends. For another group, low-income families, fast food can provide an inexpensive treat for children. Denying people, a small pleasure in life could affect their social lives or happiness. Another important point is that if the reason for taxing fast food is to reduce obesity, it may be ineffective. It is true that fast food is high in sugar, salt and fat, all of which cause weight gain and are detrimental to our health. However, we also know that there are other factors which contribute to the risk of obesity, such as lack of exercise and inappropriate portion size. While home-cooked food is generally healthy, this is not always the case. I personally know a family that used to eat high-fat, home-cooked food in enormous portions. They all suffered from health problems due to obesity. On the other hand, I do understand the point of view of those who say drastic action is needed. If fast food were taxed and became expensive, people would be forced to seek out healthier options. In addition, food producers would have an incentive to provide healthier foods. However, there is likely to be resistance from consumers and producers who want to have a wider choice. To conclude, although imposing a higher tax on fast food could have some positive effects, these would be outweighed by the drawbacks. For one thing, some sectors of society would feel victimized, and there is also the fact that simply raising tax would not result in a much healthier society. What we really need is greater awareness of diet and cheaper healthy food. Pick Out The Opinion Marking Signals.​</a>

                                            we do not succeed in charging things in accordance with our desire ls, but gradually our desires change. The situation that we hoped to chance because it was intolerable becomes unimportant to us. We have failed to surmount the obstacle, as we were absolutely determined to do, but life has taken us round it, led us beyond it and then if we turn round to gaze into the distance of the past, we can barely see it, so imperceptible has it become.” – Marcel Proust, In Search of Lost Time4. “The most important things are the hardest to say. They are the things you get ashamed of, because words shrink things that seemed limitless when they were in your head to no more than living size when they’re brought out. But it’s more than that, isn’t it? The most important things lie too close to wherever your secret heart is buried, like landmarks to a treasure your enemies would love to steal away. And you may make revelations that cost you dearly only to have people look at you in a funny way, not understanding what you’ve said at all, or why you thought it was so important that you almost cried while you were saying it. That’s the worst, I think. When the secret stays locked within not for want of a teller but for want of an understanding ear.” Stephen King, Different Seasons    ​</a>

                            6. Nowadays, more and more people are affected by health issues such as diabetes and heart disease which are linked to overconsumption of cheap, mass-production food. Some people believe the only solution is to make fast food less affordable by taxing it highly. Despite the severity of the problem, I think this is quite wrong. Increasing the tax on fast food would unfairly penalize people and may not necessarily bring about the desired health benefits First, fast food is about more than just nutrition. Many teenagers spend money on fast food not because they need to eat out but because this is how they socialize. Fast-food restaurants provide a safe, convenient place for young people to meet friends. For another group, low-income families, fast food can provide an inexpensive treat for children. Denying people, a small pleasure in life could affect their social lives or happiness. Another important point is that if the reason for taxing fast food is to reduce obesity, it may be ineffective. It is true that fast food is high in sugar, salt and fat, all of which cause weight gain and are detrimental to our health. However, we also know that there are other factors which contribute to the risk of obesity, such as lack of exercise and inappropriate portion size. While home-cooked food is generally healthy, this is not always the case. I personally know a family that used to eat high-fat, home-cooked food in enormous portions. They all suffered from health problems due to obesity. On the other hand, I do understand the point of view of those who say drastic action is needed. If fast food were taxed and became expensive, people would be forced to seek out healthier options. In addition, food producers would have an incentive to provide healthier foods. However, there is likely to be resistance from consumers and producers who want to have a wider choice. To conclude, although imposing a higher tax on fast food could have some positive effects, these would be outweighed by the drawbacks. For one thing, some sectors of society would feel victimized, and there is also the fact that simply raising tax would not result in a much healthier society. What we really need is greater awareness of diet and cheaper healthy food. Pick Out The Opinion Marking Signals.​</h2><br />

Step 1 in the scientific method is to ask a question about your observation.Step 2 is to state a possible answer to the question, or a hypothesis. Step 3 is to test the hypothesis.

                            19. Nowadays, more and more people are affected by health issues such as diabetes and heart disease which are linked to overconsumption of cheap, mass-production food. Some people believe the only solution is to make fast food less affordable by taxing it highly. Despite the severity of the problem, I think this is quite wrong. Increasing the tax on fast food would unfairly penalize people and may not necessarily bring about the desired health benefits First, fast food is about more than just nutrition. Many teenagers spend money on fast food not because they need to eat out but because this is how they socialize. Fast-food restaurants provide a safe, convenient place for young people to meet friends. For another group, low-income families, fast food can provide an inexpensive treat for children. Denying people, a small pleasure in life could affect their social lives or happiness. Another important point is that if the reason for taxing fast food is to reduce obesity, it may be ineffective. It is true that fast food is high in sugar, salt and fat, all of which cause weight gain and are detrimental to our health. However, we also know that there are other factors which contribute to the risk of obesity, such as lack of exercise and inappropriate portion size. While home-cooked food is generally healthy, this is not always the case. I personally know a family that used to eat high-fat, home-cooked food in enormous portions. They all suffered from health problems due to obesity. On the other hand, I do understand the point of view of those who say drastic action is needed. If fast food were taxed and became expensive, people would be forced to seek out healthier options. In addition, food producers would have an incentive to provide healthier foods. However, there is likely to be resistance from consumers and producers who want to have a wider choice. To conclude, although imposing a higher tax on fast food could have some positive effects, these would be outweighed by the drawbacks. For one thing, some sectors of society would feel victimized, and there is also the fact that simply raising tax would not result in a much healthier society. What we really need is greater awareness of diet and cheaper healthy food. Pick Out The Opinion Marking Signals.​</h2><br />

Afterwards, identify the problems/issues met by the author in his desire to improve his community by listing down the issues in the table provided then put a label what issue is it Sanitary Reform and Famine Relief by: M.K. Gandhi It has always been possible for me to reconcile myself to any one member of the body politic remaining out of use. I have always been loathe to hide or connive at the weak points of the community or to press for its rights without having purged it of its blemishes Therefore, ever since my settlement in Natal. I had been endeavoring to clear the community of a charge that had been leveled against it, not without a certain amount of truth The charge had often been made that the Indian was slovenly in his habits and did not keep his house and surroundings clean. The principal men of the community had, therefore, already begun to put their house in order, but house-to-house inspection was undertaken only when plague was reported to be imminent in Durban. This was done after consulting, and gaining the approval of the city fathers, who had desired our cooperation Our cooperation made work easier for them and at the same time lessened our hardships. For whenever there is an outbreak of epidemics, the executive, as a general rule, get impatient, take excessive measures and behave to such as may have incurred their displeasure with a heavy hand. The community saved itself from this oppression by voluntarily taking sanitary measures But I had some bitter experiences. I saw that I could not so easily count on the help of the community in getting it to do its own duty, as I could in claiming for its rights At some places I met with insults, at others with polite indifference. It was too much for people to bestir themselves to keep their surroundings clean Toe expect them to find money for the work was out of the question. These experiences taught me better than ever before, that without infinite patience it was impossible to get the people to do any work. It is the reformer who is anxious for the reform, and not the society, from which he should expect nothing better than opposition, abhorrence and even moral persecution Why may not society regard as retrogression what the reformers holds dear as life itself? Nevertheless, the result of this agitation was that Indian community learnt to recognize more or less the necessity for keeping their house and environments clean I gained the esteem of the authorities. They saw that, though I had made it my business to ventilate grievances and press rights, I was no less keen and insistent upon self-purification There was one thing, however, which still remained to be done, namely, the awakening in the Indian settler of a sense of duty to the motherland India was poor the Indian settler went to South Africa in search of wealth, and he was bound to contribute part off his earnings for the benefit of his countrymen in the hour of their adversity. This the settler did during the terrible famines of 1897 and 1899. They contributed handsomely for famine relief, and more so in 1899 than 1897 We had appealed to Englishmen also for funds, and they had responded well. Even the indentured Indians gave their share to the contribution, and the system inaugurated at the time of these families had been continued ever since, and we know that Indians in South Africa never fail to send handsome contribution to India in times of national calamity Thus, service of the Indians in South Africa ever revealed to me new implications of truth in every stage Truth is like a vast tree, which yields more and more fruit, the more you nurture it. The deeper the search in the mine of truth, he richer the discovery of the gems buried there, in the shape of openings for an ever greater variety of service.

                            29. we do not succeed in charging things in accordance with our desire ls, but gradually our desires change. The situation that we hoped to chance because it was intolerable becomes unimportant to us. We have failed to surmount the obstacle, as we were absolutely determined to do, but life has taken us round it, led us beyond it and then if we turn round to gaze into the distance of the past, we can barely see it, so imperceptible has it become.” – Marcel Proust, In Search of Lost Time4. “The most important things are the hardest to say. They are the things you get ashamed of, because words shrink things that seemed limitless when they were in your head to no more than living size when they’re brought out. But it’s more than that, isn’t it? The most important things lie too close to wherever your secret heart is buried, like landmarks to a treasure your enemies would love to steal away. And you may make revelations that cost you dearly only to have people look at you in a funny way, not understanding what you’ve said at all, or why you thought it was so important that you almost cried while you were saying it. That’s the worst, I think. When the secret stays locked within not for want of a teller but for want of an understanding ear.” Stephen King, Different Seasons    ​</h2><br />
