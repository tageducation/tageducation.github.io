                        <strong>Answer:</strong><p>Many people are afraid of death because they think that they are so many things they will do in their life.But what Alfred Lord Tennyson means to his poem that we should embrace when death comes in our lives because when your time come you don't have the chance to escape because it is a part of God plans and life is a thing that we borrow from God</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>hope its help;)<strong>Crossing the Bar : can you associate this with other people's experiences?</strong><p><strong>Death</strong> is frequently associated with fear in our culture. It appears to be as devastatingly final and excruciatingly unjust as late blight on tomatoes. However, the concept that death is a terrifying occurrence is a very human one, and one that we have just lately begun to tell ourselves. To our forefathers, <strong>death</strong> was both a source of pain and a source of release. <strong>Death </strong>was never considered an end for most of our forefathers. Rather, it was the start of a journey into the unknown.</p><p>'Crossing the Bar' was written by Tennyson in 1889, three years before his death. He was eighty-one years old at the time and had become gravely ill. As a result, he predicts his <strong>death</strong> in this poem and uses metaphorical language to communicate his thoughts and feelings.</p><p>In the poem, the author utilizes the voyage metaphor, comparing his soul's journey to the next world to a ship's passage through a sand bar – symbolic of the barrier between this world and the next – to enter the main sea and achieve its objective. There should be no grief for the poet as his trip to the next realm begins. He want to depart from this world quietly.</p><p>As a result, the poem demonstrates the poet's belief in religion, God, and life beyond <strong>death</strong>. It emphasizes that death is not the end of life since the human spirit is everlasting. It also instructs us how to deal with death in the greatest way possible. Death should be embraced calmly and gladly because it just serves to assist us enter the next life.</p><p></p><p>Can you associate this with other people’s experiences?

                        <p>The speaker confronts the reality of imminent death in the poetry <strong>"Crossing the Bar," </strong>where he or she finds a certain peace in the thought of dying. According to the speaker, dying is only a passage into a different kind of existence and should not be dreaded (specifically, the Christian afterlife). The passage from a coastal location to a sea or ocean is symbolized by a sandbar, and the speaker requests that they not experience any "sadness of leaving" on their behalf. As a result, the poem is by its very nature a defense of accepting death, with the solace-giving knowledge of God's love acting as solace.</p><p></p><p>The speaker wants to die quietly, in keeping with their belief that life is simply a passing. Disturbing the sandbar would be akin to fretting, dreading, and even opposing death in a metaphysical sense. The most appropriate way to die would seem to be to quietly suffocate while being swept away by a tidal that is <strong>"too full for sound and foam."</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>The lines draw a connection between the ocean and eternity</strong>, bringing forward the idea that the speaker is only returning to the everlasting realm from which they came, even though from out our bourne of Time and Place / The flood may bear me far. However, the speaker does admit that dying entails leaving the material world and going someplace quite remote. Genuinely, the speaker believes that both their existence and eventual demise were important to God's purpose.</p><p></p><p>To learn more about the poem CROSSING THE BAR, just click the link below:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/22721158</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/9861653</p><p></p><p>#SPJ5</p><br />

                        CROSSING THE BAR POEM<p>Attached is the lyrics of poem. </p><p></p><p>The<strong> use of symbols to represent concepts and qualities</strong> and to convey meaning other than their literal connotations is known as symbolism in literature. In the poem "Crossing the Bar," Tennyson <strong>employs a multitude of symbols to accentuate the poem's relevance and underlying meaning.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>1. What do sunset and evening star symbolize?</strong></p><p>The evening star, which rises with the sunset, represent<strong>s hope for a new life after death. </strong>The sunset also represents death. <strong>Age or getting old</strong> is represented by the "sunset and evening star." When the day finishes and the evening star rises in the sky at sunset, the speaker's life is metaphorically coming to an end.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>2. What does turns again home in Stanza 2 mean?</strong></p><p>It refers to <strong>the moment when the tide turns around and fills the harbor, burying the sandbar.</strong> If the tide is coming in, our speaker will have no trouble. There is nothing preventing him from <strong>cruising out over that sandbar and into the infinite deep.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>3. Who is entity referred to by the word Pilot in Stanza 4?</strong></p><p>The speaker wishes to personally<strong> encounter God</strong>, <strong>who is represented by the Pilot.</strong> The Pilot has been on board all along, but in the dark I have not seen him. </p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>4. What does crossing the bar mean?</strong></p><p>Crossing the bar is a <strong>metaphor that refers to transitioning peacefully and securely from life to death. </strong>The speaker wishes to personally encounter God, who is represented by the Pilot.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>5. How can you relate the meaning of the poem to your personal experience?</strong></p><p>A poem's structure, which is determined by each stanza, might truly relate to our everyday lives. It occasionally<strong> demonstrates for us how our lives might take the course that we choose. It also represents the decisions we make in life to better ourselves</strong>. And occasionally, something can open our eyes and actually make us better people.</p><p></p><p><strong>6. Can you associate this with other people's experiences? Explain.</strong></p><p>Because they believe they have so much to accomplish in life, many people are afraid of death. However, Alfred Lord Tennyson suggests in <strong>his poem that we should embrace death when it enters our lives </strong>because there is no way to avoid it because it is a part of God's plans and life is something we borrow from God.</p><p></p><p></p><p>The poem's moral lesson is that since <strong>death is a natural process, we shouldn't ever fear or lament it.</strong> We must peacefully embrace death and cross the line between life and death if we want to see the creator, God, face to face.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Meaning of Poetry, Poem:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/3036573</p><p></p><p></p><p>#SPJ6</p><br />

                        <p>1.)The “sunset and evening star” are symbolic of getting old. As the evening star appears in the sky at the time of sunset when the day ends metaphorically it refers the end of the life and beginning of the afterlife.</p><p></p><p>2.) he looks alive but he is dead because he has no energy.

Yes, I heard so many situations happened that same like this. is really touch coz many of them are commit suicide to know that they can see God afterlife.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. The “sunset and evening star” are symbolic of getting old. As the evening star appears in the sky at the time of sunset when the day ends metaphorically it refers the end of the life of the speaker. “And one clear call for me!”</p><p></p><p>2. The line “turns again home” means the tide comes back in to the sea, from where it was once drawn out, The metaphorical meaning to this line is that the poet implies one goes back, after death, to the place from where one has come</p><p></p><p>3. The Pilot is a metaphor for God, whom the speaker hopes to meet face to face.</p><p></p><p>4. "Crossing the bar" refers to the death of a mariner. The phrase has its origin in the fact that most rivers and bays develop a sandbar across their entrances, and 'crossing the bar' meant leaving the safety of the harbor for the unknown."</p><p></p><p>5. We can relate to it by unlocking the hidden meaning of words and connecting them to personal experiences we have gone through.</p><p></p><p>6. Many people are afraid of death because they think that they are so many things they will do in their life.But what Alfred Lord Tennyson means to his poem that we should embrace when death comes in our lives because when your time come you don't have the chance to escape because it is a part of God plans and life is a thing that we borrow from God.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p>sana makatulong po, nakita ko lang din yan dini. thank you</p><br />
