Indeed, giving is an art of generous service to other people. It is an act of kindness. It is the language in which the deaf can hear and blind can see. Helping others makes you feel good and you also get satisfacion from knowing you have helped. It teaches you that there are people who are in a less healthy situation than yours, and so you will be more grateful and value vihat you have. in helping others, it is important to identify first whether someone needs or wants your help before you think what you can do for them. You should also consider when is the best time to offer help. Being helpful in any way you can and wherever you are can give inspiration to others in your community. You do not always need money to start up helping. You can always maximize on your talent or skills. Consider the following: 1. When you are good in Math, you can help a classmate through peer tutoring. 2. When you want to engage in socio-civic activities, you may join fund drives and charity events of your school or barangay.​</a>
