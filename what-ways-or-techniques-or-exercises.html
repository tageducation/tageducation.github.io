                            15. What ways or techniques or exercises do you use to strengthen yourself so as to increase its potency to choose and hence control your life? ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>WAYS / TECHNIQUES / EXERCISES to </strong><strong>STRENGTHEN SELF POTENCY</strong><strong>  in </strong><strong>CONTROLLING THE LIFE</strong><strong>:</strong></p><p>1. Regulate the rhythm of breathing</p><p>2. Resist anger and control yourself</p><p>3. Controlling the level of self-awareness</p><p>4. Do the activities you like to choose your thoughts</p><p>5. Changing the point of view</p><p>6. Imagine every day as the last day</p><p>7. Be wise when taking action</p><p>8. Able to forgive each other</p><p>9. Don't bring up a problem</p><p>10. Thinking about the possible impact</p><p>11. List of feelings you have</p><p>12. Writing about the situation of the heart</p><p>13. Doing meditation</p><p></p><p><strong>EXPLANATION:</strong></p><p><strong>1. Regulate the rhythm of breathing</strong></p><p>The method is very easy, you just need to take a deep and slow breath, then feel the pleasure in each exhalation before continuing your daily activities. Doing this can help you to clear your head in a short amount of time. By adjusting the rhythm of your breathing you are already in the first step to better self-control.</p><p></p><p><strong>2. Resist anger and control yourself</strong></p><p>The second way to control yourself is to hold back your anger. When you are in a situation where the emotions of anger are difficult to manage, try to remain calm and try to contain the anger that comes out at that time.</p><p></p><p><strong>3. Controlling the level of self-awareness</strong></p><p>This is very important because when you are emotional, someone often loses awareness of their actions. In self-expression, we must know the right time and place to express it.</p><p></p><p><strong>4. Doing activities you like to distract your mind</strong></p><p>Do activities that you enjoy such as playing, watching, exercising, or shopping. If you need a moment, then find a way to manage the time so that no business is neglected.</p><p></p><p><strong>5. Changing the point of view</strong></p><p>By changing the point of view on a problem. Assume that if something happens, then every action will have a lesson, be it positive or negative. At least with this incident, you will learn so that in the future you can become better and avoid problems that can harm yourself.</p><p></p><p><strong>6. Imagine every day as the last day</strong></p><p>Self-control is imagining each day as the last day so you will be calmer because you want to be a better person, so the emotions will slowly subside.</p><p></p><p><strong>7. Be wise when taking action</strong></p><p>To control yourself is to be wise every time you take an action and not to rush because you have a reason to want to solve the problem as quickly as possible. Because of this action, it could make existing problems more fatal and complicated. What is needed is calmness and accuracy in making a choice with wise thinking.</p><p></p><p><strong>8. Able to forgive each other</strong></p><p>To control oneself is to be able to forgive one another, although to forgive others is a difficult thing. However, to be able to control yourself better, forgiveness is an important part so that you avoid negative thoughts.</p><p></p><p><strong>9. Not raising a problem</strong></p><p>To control yourself is to not bring up a problem, that way you can avoid any pressure within yourself. Often the problem is not as big as you think, you have to think clearly first, so you can see the problem objectively and decide what to do well.</p><p></p><p><strong>10. Thinking about the possible impact</strong></p><p>By thinking about the repercussions of letting emotions take control. The appearance of overflowing emotions is not a bad thing and it is normal if it occurs. For example, when what you want really happens, or when things get really bad, or when you lose something valuable.</p><p></p><p><strong>11. Identify the feelings you have</strong></p><p>By taking a moment you can see or examine the state and feelings of your heart at that time. When emotions suddenly come, often a person does various negative things that can harm himself and others.</p><p></p><p><strong>12. Writing about the situation of the heart</strong></p><p>By pouring it on a paper, you can reflect on the feelings you have more deeply so that you can trace back the mental state that was in your mind at that time. Identify the problem that caused the emotion to occur, then it is possible to find a way to turn the emotion into something more positive.</p><p></p><p><strong>13. Doing meditation</strong></p><p>Meditation can help a person to increase awareness of all his feelings and experiences. When you meditate, you will try to understand all the feelings that arise, so that you can realize what makes it complicated without blaming everything on yourself and be willing to try to change and remove them from your mind.</p><p></p><p>Let's see more about discipline and self control here:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/2774359</p><p></p><p>#SPJ2</p><br />
