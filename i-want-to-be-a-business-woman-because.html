Write your "Mother Mountain Retold by Ong In one of the islands in Batanes, a widow lived with her two daughters who only wanted to play the whole day. The only thing that the mother asked of her daughters was to have supper ready by the time she got home from working in the fields. One night when she got home and her daughters were nowhere to be seen, she made dinner herself. When the girls returned and saw their mother busy in the kitchen, they decided to play some more. The mother could not take it anymore and calmly walked away from their house. Though the girls eventually followed her, it was already too late. The mother had taken the shape of a mountain, now called Mount Traya. "Mother Mountain" resonated with Ong because it's a story that deals with a basic childhood fear: if you're not good, your mother will leave." It is also a wonderful tale about how a mountain that looks like a woman was formed.

                                            The Golden Fish Acts WiselyUpon a certain island in the middle of the sea lived a fisherman and his wife. Theywere so poor they often went without bread when the fishing did not go well.One day the man caught a small golden fish who begged to be let go. Because theman did let him go, the little fish promised that he would come back if the fisherman everneeded help. The man said that he and his wife had no food, and when the man returnedhome there was a nice meal on the table. But the fisherman's wife was greedy.After she ate the nice meal, she went to bed planning what they should demand fromthe golden fish next. She woke up early the next morning and shook her husband awake.“Wake up, you lazy man! Go and tell your fish that I need a new washtub!” So he went andcalled to the golden fish again, and when he returned home there was a beautiful newwashtub in the yard.Each day the fisherman's wife had a new demand. And each one was granted. Thefisherman's wife got a big new house, beautiful new clothes, servants to do her work, and ahorse-drawn carriage to ride in. But the fisherman did not enjoy the new things, and he wasashamed of his greedy wife. She was rude to the servants, and she was too busy thinking upnew demands to speak to her husband.Once again, she demanded that he call the golden fish. She wanted to be Queen ofthe Waters. “Make your wife Queen of the Waters?” exclaimed the golden fish. That is thelast thing I should do. She is unfit to rule. She cannot even rule herself. I shall make her apoor woman again. Goodbye! You will see me no more.”With great sorrow and dread, the fisherman went home to tell his wife the news. Tohis surprise, the big house had been transformed into their little old cabin, and his wife wasclothed in rags. Life was much easier for the fisherman after that. His wife had learned theresults of greed. She planted a little garden, to provide food when the fishing did not go well.Sometimes when the fisherman drew in his line, the sun glinted on the scales of hiscatch, and he had a moment's hope of seeing his little friend again. But that was never tocome to pass.                 "Story Map"Setting:characters: Plot Beginning:Middle:Ending:Theme:So sorry if this was long Nonsense = Report ​</a>

His little daughter Su-an wants to spend her birthday with her mother in Busan. Seok-woo sees a video of Su-an attempting to sing "Aloha ʻOe" at her singing recital and succumbing to stage fright as a result of his absence. Overcome with guilt, he decides to indulge Su-an's wish. They board the KTX 101 at Seoul Station, en route to Busan. Other passengers include working-class man Sang-hwa and his pregnant wife Seong-kyeong, selfish COO Yon-suk, a high school baseball team, including Yong-guk and his cheerleader girlfriend Jin-hee, elderly sisters In-gil and Jong-gil, and a homeless stowaway. As the train departs, an infected woman boards, becomes a zombie and attacks a train attendant. The infection spreads rapidly throughout the train. Seok-woo learns that the zombie plague started at a factory connected to his business, and selfishly plans to use his connections to get to safety.The group escapes to another car and locks the doors. Reports make it known that an epidemic is spreading across the country. After the train stops at Daejeon Station, where an army post is rumored to be housed the surviving passengers find that all the personnel stationed there are infected by the virus, and Seok-woo figures it out himself when a soldier is completely overrun by the infected. The surviving passengers manage to make it back on the train, but Sang-hwa, Seok-woo, Yong-guk, and two surviving baseball players get stuck closing the door. Su-an, Seong-kyeong, In-gil, and the homeless man manage to get on, but they find out that they are in the crosshairs of zombies, and they hide inside a bathroom. Meanwhile. Seok-woo's team manages to close the door, but the glass door shatters, and in the process of running, only Yong-guk, Sang-hwa, and Seok-woo manage to get on the train, with the two baseball players becoming infected. The military establishes a quarantine zone near Busan, and the conductor heads the train there.Seok-woo, Sang-hwa and Yong-guk, who have become separated from their loved ones in a different car, use Yong-guk's baseball bat, riot gear, and hand-to-hand combat to fight their way to them through the zombies. Once regrouped, they struggle through the horde to the front car, where the rest of the passengers are sheltered. However, the homeless man steps on a soda can, alerting the zombies to their location, and Seok-woo and Sang-hwa attempt to hold off the zombies, but Sang-hwa is bitten. At Yon-suk's instigation, the passengers prevent the survivors from entering, fearing that they are infected. Sang-hwa sacrifices himself to give the others time to enter the car by force by allowing all the zombies to eat him. Yon-suk and the passengers demand that the survivors isolate themselves in the vestibule. However, Jong-gil – disgusted at the passengers' selfishness and despairing the loss of her sister, who has become a zombie – allows the zombies to enter and kill them all. And because the other passengers had forced Seok-woo's group to isolate, his group remains safe. Yon-suk also escapes by hiding in the bathroom with a train attendant, with the survivors breaking off into groups, with Seok-woo, Su-an, Seong-kyeong, Jin-hee, Yong-guk, and the homeless man in one group, and Yon-suk, and the final train attendant in the otherA blocked track at East Daegu train station forces the survivors to stop and search for another train. Yon-suk pushes Jin-hee, the train captain, and the train attendant to the zombies to save himself and Jin-hee is bitten. Heartbroken, Yong-guk stays with Jin-hee until she turns and kills him. Meanwhile, a flaming locomotive derails and the survivors are trapped under a train full of zombies. As the zombies drop by breaking the windows, the homeless man sacrifices himself so that Seok-woo has time to save Su-an and Seong-kyeong through a small hole under the derailed train. Realizing that there is a locomotive that still works, Seok-woo, Seong-kyeong, and Su-an narrowly avoid the zombies, and the three board the working locomotive and encounter Yon-suk, who is on the verge of turning into a zombie. Seok-woo manages to throw him off the train, but is bitten in the process. He teaches Seong-kyeong how to operate the train, and says goodbye to his sobbing daughter, throwing himself off the train before he turns into a zombie. Due to another train blockage, Su-an and Seong-kyeong stop at a tunnel. They continue following the tracks on foot. Snipers stationed on the other side prepare to shoot at what they believe to be zombies. Upon hearing Su-an sobbing and singing "Aloha ʻOe" for her father, they lower their weapons, realizing the pair are human, as they help get them to safety.​</a>

Write your "Mother Mountain Retold by Ong In one of the islands in Batanes, a widow lived with her two daughters who only wanted to play the whole day. The only thing that the mother asked of her daughters was to have supper ready by the time she got home from working in the fields. One night when she got home and her daughters were nowhere to be seen, she made dinner herself. When the girls returned and saw their mother busy in the kitchen, they decided to play some more. The mother could not take it anymore and calmly walked away from their house. Though the girls eventually followed her, it was already too late. The mother had taken the shape of a mountain, now called Mount Traya. "Mother Mountain" resonated with Ong because it's a story that deals with a basic childhood fear: if you're not good, your mother will leave." It is also a wonderful tale about how a mountain that looks like a woman was formed. This cautionary tale about beauty and vanity is something little girls need to know about DE BOOK BUTTERFLY By Ong Plot Character by? w won yoon cherer Mother and two daughter S Setting Main Idea werere to settore por Det rapide ett story Title Mother Mountain Problem Personal Besponse Author by Ona Rating I give this book 5 stars!

                            5. The Golden Fish Acts WiselyUpon a certain island in the middle of the sea lived a fisherman and his wife. Theywere so poor they often went without bread when the fishing did not go well.One day the man caught a small golden fish who begged to be let go. Because theman did let him go, the little fish promised that he would come back if the fisherman everneeded help. The man said that he and his wife had no food, and when the man returnedhome there was a nice meal on the table. But the fisherman's wife was greedy.After she ate the nice meal, she went to bed planning what they should demand fromthe golden fish next. She woke up early the next morning and shook her husband awake.“Wake up, you lazy man! Go and tell your fish that I need a new washtub!” So he went andcalled to the golden fish again, and when he returned home there was a beautiful newwashtub in the yard.Each day the fisherman's wife had a new demand. And each one was granted. Thefisherman's wife got a big new house, beautiful new clothes, servants to do her work, and ahorse-drawn carriage to ride in. But the fisherman did not enjoy the new things, and he wasashamed of his greedy wife. She was rude to the servants, and she was too busy thinking upnew demands to speak to her husband.Once again, she demanded that he call the golden fish. She wanted to be Queen ofthe Waters. “Make your wife Queen of the Waters?” exclaimed the golden fish. That is thelast thing I should do. She is unfit to rule. She cannot even rule herself. I shall make her apoor woman again. Goodbye! You will see me no more.”With great sorrow and dread, the fisherman went home to tell his wife the news. Tohis surprise, the big house had been transformed into their little old cabin, and his wife wasclothed in rags. Life was much easier for the fisherman after that. His wife had learned theresults of greed. She planted a little garden, to provide food when the fishing did not go well.Sometimes when the fisherman drew in his line, the sun glinted on the scales of hiscatch, and he had a moment's hope of seeing his little friend again. But that was never tocome to pass.                 "Story Map"Setting:characters: Plot Beginning:Middle:Ending:Theme:So sorry if this was long Nonsense = Report ​</h2><br />

This is not a Question I just want to help who need to find the plot of train to busan, you can see here too the main characters Fund manager Seok-woo is a cynical workaholic and divorced father. His little daughter Su-an wants to spend her birthday with her mother in Busan. Seok-woo sees a video of Su-an attempting to sing "Aloha ʻOe" at her singing recital and succumbing to stage fright as a result of his absence. Overcome with guilt, he decides to indulge Su-an's wish. They board the KTX 101 at Seoul Station, en route to Busan. Other passengers include working-class man Sang-hwa and his pregnant wife Seong-kyeong, selfish COO Yon-suk, a high school baseball team, including Yong-guk and his cheerleader girlfriend Jin-hee, elderly sisters In-gil and Jong-gil, and a homeless stowaway. As the train departs, an infected woman boards, becomes a zombie and attacks a train attendant. The infection spreads rapidly throughout the train. Seok-woo learns that the zombie plague started at a factory connected to his business, and selfishly plans to use his connections to get to safety.The group escapes to another car and locks the doors. Reports make it known that an epidemic is spreading across the country. After the train stops at Daejeon Station, where an army post is rumored to be housed the surviving passengers find that all the personnel stationed there are infected by the virus, and Seok-woo figures it out himself when a soldier is completely overrun by the infected. The surviving passengers manage to make it back on the train, but Sang-hwa, Seok-woo, Yong-guk, and two surviving baseball players get stuck closing the door. Su-an, Seong-kyeong, In-gil, and the homeless man manage to get on, but they find out that they are in the crosshairs of zombies, and they hide inside a bathroom. Meanwhile. Seok-woo's team manages to close the door, but the glass door shatters, and in the process of running, only Yong-guk, Sang-hwa, and Seok-woo manage to get on the train, with the two baseball players becoming infected. The military establishes a quarantine zone near Busan, and the conductor heads the train there.Seok-woo, Sang-hwa and Yong-guk, who have become separated from their loved ones in a different car, use Yong-guk's baseball bat, riot gear, and hand-to-hand combat to fight their way to them through the zombies.
