A blank piece of paper represents my world. I draw a stick figure to repre- sent myself. Around the paper, I start writing significant things in my life and I draw lines between them; my world is full of connections. The connections I have with people, my community, and the earth itself. The connections I built shape my dreams of marketing, law, and fashion, and I color my world with numerous shades. Coloring it gives me excitement. The connections I evolved with people are like lands in my world; they are dif- ferent and necessary. Every one of them affected my life in some way, but some of them shaped my dreams and aspirations more than other people. Two such people are my father and my boss at a company I work for. My father explained to me how marketing is the basis of every business. Even when we were just shopping, he would teach me marketing skills, such as branding. He helped me discover marketing as my fascination.​</a>

                                            Of More Value By Jerry B Jenkins A friend, a father of two daughters, admits he does not mind putting a line fear into the boys trying to have a date with his daughter. His daughters are sometimes embarrassed when their father asks for a few moments alone with their date, and he would rather have the young men think he is not an okay guy that he is a mean, protective father to his daughters Besides, he believes that there is no such thing as being overprotective. Another friend says he uses sports analogy to get his point across He would tell the boy, "If I owned the most expensive, exotic sports cars on the road and I let you take it for a spin, you'd be careful with it wouldn't you?" "Oh yes, Sir, you bet. " "You'd treat it better than it was your own wouldn't you?" "Yes, Sir." "I wouldn't want to think you were screeching the tires, would 17 "No. Sir" "Well, let me tell you something, just so we're straight with each other, man to man My daughter is of infinitively more value to me than any car could be. Do you got my drift? She's on loan from me to you for the next few hours and I wouldnt want to discover that she's treated with any less care or respect that I would give here. I'm responsible for her. She's mine. Im entrusting her to you. That trust gives no second chance Understood?" By then, of course, the young man is wondering why he didn't ask someone else out. He's only nodding, unable to speak Most often, he brings the gat home earlier than promised. The daughter might even complain about her father's approach, but deep down, she feels loved and cherished and you can be sure she'll marry a man who treats her that way C. DEVELOPING THE SKILLS Read the questions carefully and write your answers below. 1. How does the first father show he values his daughter? 2. How does the sports analogy of the second father affect the boy asking permission to date his daughter? 3. Which of the two fathers do you think has a better approach to their daughters' suitors?​</a>

Coloring it gives me excitement. The connections I evolved with people are like lands in my world; they are dif- ferent and necessary. Every one of them affected my life in some way, but some of them shaped my dreams and aspirations more than other people. Two such people are my father and my boss at a company I work for.

Of More Value By Jerry B Jenkins A friend, a father of two daughters, admits he does not mind putting a line fear into the boys trying to have a date with his daughter. His daughters are sometimes embarrassed when their father asks for a few moments alone with their date, and he would rather have the young men think he is not an okay guy that he is a mean, protective father to his daughters Besides, he believes that there is no such thing as being overprotective. Another friend says he uses sports analogy to get his point across He would tell the boy, "If I owned the most expensive, exotic sports cars on the road and I let you take it for a spin, you'd be careful with it wouldn't you?" "Oh yes, Sir, you bet. " "You'd treat it better than it was your own wouldn't you?" "Yes, Sir." "I wouldn't want to think you were screeching the tires, would 17 "No. Sir" "Well, let me tell you something, just so we're straight with each other, man to man My daughter is of infinitively more value to me than any car could be. Do you got my drift? She's on loan from me to you for the next few hours and I wouldnt want to discover that she's treated with any less care or respect that I would give here. I'm responsible for her. She's mine. Im entrusting her to you. That trust gives no second chance Understood?" By then, of course, the young man is wondering why he didn't ask someone else out. He's only nodding, unable to speak Most often, he brings the gat home earlier than promised. The daughter might even complain about her father's approach, but deep down, she feels loved and cherished and you can be sure she'll marry a man who treats her that way C. DEVELOPING THE SKILLS Read the questions carefully and write your answers below. 1. How does the first father show he values his daughter? 2. How does the sports analogy of the second father affect the boy asking permission to date his daughter? 3. Which of the two fathers do you think has a better approach to their daughters' suitors?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. The first father shows that he values his daughter by being protective of her and trying to scare off potential suitors who might not treat her well. He would rather have the young men think he is not an okay guy than not being a mean, protective father to his daughters.</p><p>2. The sports analogy of the second father puts pressure on the boy asking permission to date his daughter by suggesting that the father's daughter is of infinite more value than any car, and that the boy must treat her with the same care and respect as he would the father's sports car.</p><p>3. Both fathers have their own approaches, but the second father's approach may be more effective in getting his point across and making sure that the boy understands the responsibility he is taking on when asking to date his daughter.</p><br />
