                                            Activity 3.1 –Seal the Sail! Can you help the nomads “seal the sail” by filling in the sails of the boat with the needed information? Each fabric of the sail is labeled with three things that are needed before they can travel. Directions: Draw a boat that looks like what is illustrated below. On the first sail on the left side, you have to write what makes balangay uniquely different from the vinta. On the third sail on the right side, you must do the same for the vinta. Then, on the sail at the center, you have to write the similarities of the two boats. Write the answers in your activity notebook. Before you proceed with the succeeding parts of this module, kindly answer the following questions based on the previous activity: 1. What is the distinguishing characteristic of a balangay? What is the distinguishing characteristic of the vinta? 2. How does balangay differ from vinta? What are their similarities? Why do you think they have these similarities? 3. Do you know, by any chance, an everyday object or functional art form in your community which is similar to that of a balangay or vinta? If yes, what is it? Why do you say they are similar? How do people in your community use and preserve traditional, creative everyday objects?​</a>

FIRST THINGS FIRST (Provide your answer at the last pages) Analyze the text below by answering the reflection questions that follow (individually and then collectively). There is a beautiful poem used by the early Christian community. Paul cited it in his letter to the Church at Philippi (Philippians 2:5-11, NRSV) It gives us an idea about what Christianity is about. "Let the same mind be in you that was in Christ Jesus, "who, though he was in the form of God, did not regard equality with God as something to be exploited, "but emptied himself, taking the form of a slave, being born in human likeness And being found in human form, "he humbled himself and became obedient to the point of death-even death on a cross Therefore God also highly exalted him and gave him the name that is above every name, so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bend, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father. Guide questions: 1. What is the poem about? 2 What does it tell us about Christianity and the Christian faith? 3. What is important about this? II. Search and look for the symbols identified below, find out their histories, and clarify their meaning. Ichtus Chi-rho​</a>

                                            Directions: Determine the truthfulness and accuracy of the news article by answering the critical questions in the SOAPSTone table below.Public confused with changes in quarantine rules               By Raymund Antonio   Confusion over the effectivity of new quarantine levels and guidelines in Metro Manila and other parts of the country left the people more questions than answers.    Vice President Leni Robredo noted her office received complaints from the public regarding the adjustments made by the government on the different forms of community quarantine.   "ito, talaga naman parang araw-araw nagbabago, araw-araw may dagdag, araw-araw may babaguhin. Iyon talaga iyong pinakareklamo ng marami: "Ano na ba talaga? Robredo said on her weekly radio show.   (This seems to change every day, every day there are additions and changes. That's the main complaint of many people: What's really the rule?)     A cause of the problem, Robredo said, is the lack of clarity to communicate this to the public amid the coronavirus pandemic.   "Tama iyong parang mga phases para hindi bigla-bigla pero iyong parang nagkulang tayo doon sa mas klarong pagpaliwanag," she said.     (it is correct to do these phases so the enforcement is gradual but it looks like we lack in explaining it more clearly.)     But despite this, Robredo said the public should keep themselves updated on the changes in quarantine areas. The government's coronavirus task force has backtracked a few times on imposing quarantine levels and rules in various areas in response to the appeal of local officials.    It recalled the lifting of community quarantine in eight regions classified as "low risk" to coronavirus infection and placed them under modified general community quarantine.     These regions are llocos, Mimaropa, Bicol, Western Visayas, Northern Mindanao, Davao, and the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao or BARMM.    The task force also revised the status of some areas supposedly under GCQ to modified ECQ like Bulacan, Bataan, Nueva Ecija, Zambales, and Pampanga, until the end of May.Paanswer po pleas need kona po kase ngaunpahelp thank u&lt;33​</a>

There are actually a few sites that might help out some Brainly users. Given they already have English, Math, types of science, and more.Each title is done in a proper form. Usually, the title is the question itself, then the body of the questions take in the real question and the background of it. I want something similar, but something is actually wrong here.The students would sometimes brag, saying that they want the answer quick. It shouldn't be like that. Yes, this might be something done for a while, but that kind of behavior looks way too wrong in my eyes.I demand to finally make an act and start removing unnecesary kinds of titles on Brainly for a better look on the site.- No more bragging for answers (Please answer, please answer,)- Clear off unnecesary details of the question title. (No more numberings at the beginning.)- Make the question full and make it understandable. There might be grammar or spelling errors, but it should be understandable.I hope you actually understand my problem here. Why do we do this stuff to a title?</a>

FIRST THINGS FIRST (Provide your answer at the last pages) Analyze the text below by answering the reflection questions that follow (individually and then collectively). There is a beautiful poem used by the early Christian community. Paul cited it in his letter to the Church at Philippi (Philippians 2:5-11, NRSV) It gives us an idea about what Christianity is about. "Let the same mind be in you that was in Christ Jesus, "who, though he was in the form of God, did not regard equality with God as something to be exploited, "but emptied himself, taking the form of a slave, being born in human likeness And being found in human form, "he humbled himself and became obedient to the point of death-even death on a cross Therefore God also highly exalted him and gave him the name that is above every name, so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bend, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father. Guide questions: 1. What is the poem about? 2 What does it tell us about Christianity and the Christian faith? 3. What is important about this? II.

                            23. Directions: Determine the truthfulness and accuracy of the news article by answering the critical questions in the SOAPSTone table below.Public confused with changes in quarantine rules               By Raymund Antonio   Confusion over the effectivity of new quarantine levels and guidelines in Metro Manila and other parts of the country left the people more questions than answers.    Vice President Leni Robredo noted her office received complaints from the public regarding the adjustments made by the government on the different forms of community quarantine.   "ito, talaga naman parang araw-araw nagbabago, araw-araw may dagdag, araw-araw may babaguhin. Iyon talaga iyong pinakareklamo ng marami: "Ano na ba talaga? Robredo said on her weekly radio show.   (This seems to change every day, every day there are additions and changes. That's the main complaint of many people: What's really the rule?)     A cause of the problem, Robredo said, is the lack of clarity to communicate this to the public amid the coronavirus pandemic.   "Tama iyong parang mga phases para hindi bigla-bigla pero iyong parang nagkulang tayo doon sa mas klarong pagpaliwanag," she said.     (it is correct to do these phases so the enforcement is gradual but it looks like we lack in explaining it more clearly.)     But despite this, Robredo said the public should keep themselves updated on the changes in quarantine areas. The government's coronavirus task force has backtracked a few times on imposing quarantine levels and rules in various areas in response to the appeal of local officials.    It recalled the lifting of community quarantine in eight regions classified as "low risk" to coronavirus infection and placed them under modified general community quarantine.     These regions are llocos, Mimaropa, Bicol, Western Visayas, Northern Mindanao, Davao, and the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao or BARMM.    The task force also revised the status of some areas supposedly under GCQ to modified ECQ like Bulacan, Bataan, Nueva Ecija, Zambales, and Pampanga, until the end of May.Paanswer po pleas need kona po kase ngaunpahelp thank u&lt;33​</h2><br />

What kind of village is Wimbe?</p><p>Answer: <strong>William Kamkwamba's story is set in the village of Wimbe, which is located in Malawi, one of the smallest and least-developed countries in Africa. Wimbe is a small village with no electricity or running water, and most of the people in the village are subsistence farmers.</strong></p><p></p><p>2. William was an intelligent boy, but he had to drop out of school. What was the reason he stopped schooling?</p><p>Answer: <strong>William had to drop out of school because his family could not afford to pay the school fees. The family was struggling to make ends meet, and William's education was seen as a luxury they could not afford.</strong></p><p></p><p>3. What inspired William to build a windmill?</p><p>Answer: <strong>William was inspired to build a windmill after he saw a picture of a wind turbine in a science textbook. He was fascinated by the idea of harnessing the power of the wind to generate electricity, and he began to experiment with building his own windmill using scrap materials he found in his village.</strong></p><p></p><p>5. How did the village people perceive William especially during the ti was building the windmill? How did this perception change later on?</p><p>Answer: <strong>The village people initially laughed at William and thought he was crazy for trying to build a windmill. They did not believe that someone from their village could create such a thing, and they were skeptical of William's ideas. However, as they saw him working on his project and saw the results of his efforts, their perception of him began to change.</strong></p><p></p><p>6.

If I were William, I would feel hurt and discouraged by this kind of treatment. However, William was determined to pursue his dreams, and he did not let the ridicule of others hold him back.</strong></p><p></p><p>7. Describe William's first prototype and his 4-meter contraption by using supporting details from the text.</p><p>Answer: <strong>William's first prototype was a small windmill made from a bicycle wheel, PVC pipes, and other scrap materials. It was about one meter tall and was designed to generate a small amount of electricity. His later windmill was much larger, measuring four meters tall, and was made from an old tractor fan, PVC pipes, and other recycled materials. It was able to generate enough electricity to power several light bulbs and a radio.</strong></p><p></p><p>8. Lines 19-20 state, "William dropped out of school, but he did not give up on learning. Would you have done the same, knowing that in a po community, there are only a few opportunities for young people like you?</p><p>Answer: <strong>Lines 19-20 state, "William dropped out of school, but he did not give up on learning." If I were in a poor community and had limited opportunities for education, I would also try to find alternative ways to continue learning.

Robert Frost commented that writing free verse is like, "playing tennis without a net." Milan's poem is an example of free verse. It has an open form with no regular meter, rhyme, or rhythm. How do you find it? How it is different from the usual poems you read?</p><p>Answer: <strong>Milan's poem is an example of free verse, which is a form of poetry that does not follow a strict structure or rhyme scheme. Unlike traditional poetry, free verse allows the poet to experiment with language and form in a more flexible and creative way. Milan's poem is different from the usual poems I read because it has a more open and fluid structure, which allows the words and images to flow more freely.</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            29. Let's try stopping answer begging.It's annoying, okay? It's quite a strange bit but I would like to finally change that.So I am a veteran of a certain site network named Stack Exchange, and they are a Q&amp;A site also ran by the community, and they take in the topic they want. There are actually a few sites that might help out some Brainly users. Given they already have English, Math, types of science, and more.Each title is done in a proper form. Usually, the title is the question itself, then the body of the questions take in the real question and the background of it. I want something similar, but something is actually wrong here.The students would sometimes brag, saying that they want the answer quick. It shouldn't be like that. Yes, this might be something done for a while, but that kind of behavior looks way too wrong in my eyes.I demand to finally make an act and start removing unnecesary kinds of titles on Brainly for a better look on the site.- No more bragging for answers (Please answer, please answer,)- Clear off unnecesary details of the question title. (No more numberings at the beginning.)- Make the question full and make it understandable. There might be grammar or spelling errors, but it should be understandable.I hope you actually understand my problem here. Why do we do this stuff to a title?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>So that some on lookers will try to answer their questions, but that is what they think because what they get is actually sometimes the opposite. Some students may be asking for their answers like that because the due date is close or they want to finish their assignments or projects at the right time.</p><p>But this is just my opinion and not an answer for I do not know what others think, or for what their actions may be. </p><p>But I also agree to some of your terms written like making the questions full or understandable.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />
