PLS ANSWER</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>They are true masters at combining the five key elements that go into every great short story: <strong>character</strong>, <strong>setting</strong>, <strong>conflict</strong>, <strong>plot</strong> and <strong>theme</strong>. The ELLSA web-site uses one of these five key elements as the focus of each of the five on-line lessons in the Classics of American Literature section.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><strong>Title: ΦThe Shiny MoonΦ</strong><strong>By: SASSIEST MARIANNE</strong><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Once upon a time in the olden times, there was a greedy sultan in the kingdom in Sudan. He wanted the riches of the world himself. One day he prayed to the highest mountains to make the moon shine in every year of his grand birthday with all sorts of jewelries and gems of his birthday as it would be the main riches of his kingdom and him. For the past centuries, it was a the gem of the country. Foreigners in different countries came to visit as it was a rumour that every birthday of the old ruler of the king, the moon would shine bright with its all golden gem. They were intoxicated by its attraction hidden and wished to have the gems. Now, it happen to be a new sultan, as foolish as the other, wanted to have the moon himself. He then tried to make his plan work by building a catapult and throw his servants to the moon and bring the riches back to him. The plan was settled and a catapult was built. His servants were thrown but never came back. He then, infuriated, made a grand price to those who can fetch the riches back to him. Many tried but currently failed, as the price was their own lives. One day, it happened to be a magician visiting the country heard the rumours. He came to the sultan, offered to bring the riches back to him and promised to have his daughter marry the sultan. The sultan agreed, in exchange of bringing the gold back and marry the magician's daughter. Both agreement were settled. The magician went to the catapult to bring the hidden treasure of the moon while the sultan married the magician's daughter. For years, the magician didn't come back and the sultan was angry. He ordered to kill the magician's daughter by throwing her away in the palace's balcony. She meanwhile, ended her life by throwing herself first before the palace guards captured her. Then the magician came back, with the treasure he had from the moon. He was enraged to see his daughter killed because of the sultan's greediness. He cursed them to have the moon as old as the rock and have the riches with him with the king's servants and soldier leaving him behind. Now the sultan had nothing to spare.</p><p></p><p>Lesson: Greediness will lead you nothing but downfall.</p><p></p><strong>Credits:</strong><strong>Sassiest Marianne </strong><strong></strong>DONT STEAL OR ELSE &gt;:)<br />

They’re $6 a box.” Figuring there must be something special about the two $6 boxes, I asked why that was. “Well, this box is gluten-free,” the little girl replied. “What about the other box?” She beamed, “Oh, those are overpriced!” —Submitted by Kathryn Thayer, Spokane, Washington.

When the starting pistol sounded, she took off like a lightning bolt, leaving her fellow racers behind. As she neared the finish line, she stopped, turned around and motioned for the other runners to hurry.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>     the answer is in the picture<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>The force that works against the hero of the story; if a person, often a villain type. setting. The time and place of the action of the story. plot. The sequence of events in a story, built around a conflict.</p> Plot - How the author arranges events to develop the basic idea; it is the sequence of events in a story or play. The plot is a planned, logical series of events having a beginning, middle, and end. The short story usually has one plot  so it can be read in one sitting. There are five essential parts of plot:
1) Exposition (introduction) - Beginning of the story; characters, background, and setting revealed.
2) Rising Action - Events in the story become complicated; the conflict is revealed. These are events between
<p>         the introduction and climax.
</p><p>• Conflict - Essential to plot, opposition ties incidents together and moves the plot. Not merely
</p><p>limited to arguments, conflict can be any fOfI1)of struggle the main character faces. Within a short
</p><p>story, there may be only one central struggle, or there may be many minor obstacles within a
</p><p>dominant struggle. There are two ~ of conflict:
</p><p>o Internal- Struggle within one's self.
</p><p>• Character vs. Self - Struggles with own soul, physical limitations, choices, etc.
</p><p>o External - Struggle with a force outside one's self.
</p><p>• Character vs. Character - Struggles against other people.
</p><p>• Character vs. Nature - Struggles against animals, weather, environment, etc.
</p><p>• Character vs. Society - Struggles against ideas, practices, or customs of others
</p><p>3) Climax - Turning point of the story. Readers wonders what will happen next; will the conflict be resolved
</p><p>or not? Consider the climax as a three-fold phenomenon:
</p><p>• Main character receives new information.
</p><p>• Main character accepts this information (realizes it but does not necessarily agree with it).
</p><p>• Main character acts on this information (makes a choice that will determine whether or not objective is met).
</p>4) Falling action - Resolution begins; events and complications start to fall into place. These are the events
<p>         between climax and denouement.
</p>5) Resolution (Conclusion) - Final outcome of events in the story.
<p><strong>II. </strong>Setting - Time and location that a story takes place. For some stories, the setting is very important; while for
</p><p>others, it is not. When examining how setting contributes to a story, there are multiple aspects to consider:
</p>1) Place - Geographical location; where is the action of the story taking place?
2) Time - Historical period, time of day, year, etc; when is the story taking place?
3) Weather conditions - Is it rainy, sunny, stormy, etc?
4) Social conditions - What is the daily life of the character's like? Does the story contain local colour (writing
<p>that focuses on the speech, dress, mannerisms, customs, etc. of a particular place)?
</p>5) Mood or atmosphere - What feeling is created at the beginning of the story? Cheerful or eerie?
<p><strong>III.</strong> Character - There are two meanings for "character": 1) a person in a fictional story; or 2) qualities of a person.
</p> 1) People in a work of fiction can be a(n):
<p>• Protagonist - Clear center of story; all major events are important to this character.
</p><p>• Antagonist - Opposition or "enemy" of main character.
</p>2) Characteristics of a character can be revealed through:
<p>• his/her physical appearance
</p><p>• what he/she says, thinks, feels, dreams and what he/she does or does not do
</p><p>• what others say about him/her and how others react to him/her3) Characters can be ...
</p><p>o Round - Fully developed personalities that are affected by the story's events; they can learn, grow,
</p><p>or deteriorate by the end of the story. Characters are most convincing when they resemble real
</p><p>people by being consistent, motivated, and life-like.
</p><p>• Flat - One-dimensional character
</p><p>• Dynamic - Character who does go through change and "grows" during a story
</p><p>• Static - Character does not go through a change.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>• Things are not always as they appear to be.
</p><p>• Love is blind.
</p><p>• Believe in yourself.
</p><p>• People are afraid of change.
</p><p>• Don't judge a book by its cover</p><br />

                        <p> Short story-A short story is a fully developed story which is shorter than a novel and longer than a fable. It typically takes just a single sitting for reading. Short Story focuses on the incidents bigger or smaller and evokes strong feelings from its readers. A short story often has a few characters in the plot.</p><p></p><p>Elements of a story are:</p><p>Setting</p><p>Character</p><p>Point of View </p><p>Conflict</p><p>Plot</p><p>Theme</p><p></p><p>Setting-A setting (or backdrop) is the time and geographic location within a narrative, either nonfiction or fiction. It is a literary element. The setting initiates the main backdrop and mood for a story.</p><p></p><p>Character-A character is a person, animal, being, creature, or thing in a story. Writers use characters to perform the actions and speak dialogue, moving the story along a plot line. A story can have only one character (protagonist) and still be a complete story.</p><p></p><p>Plot-In a literary work, film, story or other narrative, the plot is the sequence of events where each affects the next one through the principle of cause-and-effect. The causal events of a plot can be thought of as a series of events linked by the connector "and so".</p><p></p><p>Hope it helps:)</p><br />
