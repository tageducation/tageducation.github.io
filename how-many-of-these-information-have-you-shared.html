Each group will do
Surt the Internet and research on some successful orchard growers in your
community/adjacent community or in your hometown province or any part of
the country. Gather information about the orchard grower (as an entrepreneur),
what he/she produces, where his/her products are marketed and how they are
marketed, the demand for his/her products, and so forth. You may also research
on some tips for his/her successful orchard growing project. Share these gathered
information to the class via a slide presentation. In the end, compare all successful
orchard growers on the board and find some similarities/commonalities in their
business that made them successful.
Write down the names of trees in your community. Describe the trees and whe
they are located. How many do you see in your neighborhood? How do you tr
having trees around you? Write your feelings and thoughts in your personal jour
and share this in class.
