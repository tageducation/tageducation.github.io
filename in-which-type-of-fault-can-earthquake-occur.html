Direction: Using the given text below, complete what is asked in the given graphic organizer.
Faults are considered to be active if they have moved one or more times in at least 10,000 years. Active faults are
structure along which we expect displacement to occur. Inactive faults are structures that we can identify but which
not have earthquakes. There are five major active faults in the Philippines: the Central Philippine Fault, Marikina
Valley Fault, Western Philippine Fault, Eastern Philippine Fault, and Southern of Mindanao Fault.
Fault is (1)(define).

                            26. ANSWER SHEET
Direction: Using the given text below, complete what is asked in the given graphic organizer.
Faults are considered to be active if they have moved one or more times in at least 10,000 years. Active faults are
structure along which we expect displacement to occur. Inactive faults are structures that we can identify but which
not have earthquakes. There are five major active faults in the Philippines: the Central Philippine Fault, Marikina
Valley Fault, Western Philippine Fault, Eastern Philippine Fault, and Southern of Mindanao Fault.
Fault is (1)(define).
