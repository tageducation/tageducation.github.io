                        <p><strong>1. WHAT MOTIVATED ME TO BECOME AN ENTREPRENEUR:</strong></p><p>When I saw an entrepreneur who is already successful and popular, I was thinking about. Such motivation was drives me in changing individuals from passive behavior to active ones. </p><p>This may be because I am a person who is basically active, in fact I have been able to earn money since I was a student. I want to be <strong>financially independent</strong>, I want <strong>to send my siblings to school</strong>, I want to be able <strong>to travel or buy something without checking the price</strong>, and <strong>help as many people as possible.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>2. THE CHARACTERISTIC AND COMPETENCIES THAT MADE ME A SUCCESSFUL ENTREPRENEUR(STILL ON PROCESS):</strong></p><strong>Character originality</strong><p>This innovative, creative, flexible and versatile attitude is an entrepreneurial character, which manifests itself in characteristics. The entrepreneur profile that I have has a character of originality. This means that an entrepreneur must have the character of originality or authenticity. This can be seen from my innovative, creative, and flexible attitude in creating things. In addition, this character is also open-minded, rich in knowledge, and has a lot of information.</p><strong>Leadership character</strong><p>An entrepreneur must also have a leadership character so that his business activities can run well. Leadership means having the ability to lead, direct, and also be good at embracing workers or employees. Not only that, the leadership character that I have also usually has a sociable attitude, and is also willing to accept criticism and suggestions from other people, both other workers and from consumers.</p><strong>Dare to take risks</strong><p>In carrying out business activities, there are certainly many challenges, even failures. In order to overcome this, it takes a brave character and is ready to take risks, whatever the challenges that will be faced later.</p><strong>Confident character</strong><p>This means that an entrepreneur must have a sense of trust, independence, and optimism. Confidence means believing in myself if I am able to do business and believe that I can face any challenges or risks that may exist. In addition, the character of self-confidence also means independence. This means that entrepreneurs have the freedom to think, act, and even make decisions, without coercion from other parties. However, remain open to criticism and suggestions.</p><strong>Work and results oriented character</strong><p>This is the character of an entrepreneur like me who has a passion for progress and the pursuit of profit. Entrepreneurs who have this character will always instill in themselves the spirit to move forward and try to get profit and success.</p><p></p><p><strong>3. MY INSIGHT OF BEING EMPLOYED:</strong></p><p>I actually prefer of being entrepreneur rather than being employed. Not that being an employee is wrong. For those who work as an employee, of course, they have their own satisfaction if they succeed in getting promoted in the company where they work. Meanwhile, for people like me who have a dream of becoming a successful entrepreneur, they will certainly be very happy if the business they run makes huge profits with the motivation above that I mentioned.</p><p></p><p>Let's learn about the true meaning of entrepreneurship here:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/29211873</p><p></p><p>#SPJ2</p><br />

                            15. what do you think of being employed?why didn't you choose that path?​</h2><br />
                        <p>In this world there are various <strong>occupations and professions</strong>, ranging from <strong>teachers, doctors, office workers, businessmen or entrepreneurs, to government officials</strong>. But broadly speaking, most people still prefer to be office workers or employees rather than choosing a way to do business.</p><p></p><p>I myself am a person who <strong>prefers to do business</strong> (previously I was an employee for 5 years). Of course, there are several reasons why people prefer to be employees over being businessmen, which will be discussed below:</p><p></p><p><strong>1. Not Everyone Is Interested In Business</strong></p><p>The first reason is a matter of <strong>interest</strong> of each person who is different, where not everyone is really interested in doing business. While there are people who like to be involved in business processes and the creation of business ideas, there are also people who don't like them at all. It can be difficult to do something that you didn't like or interested in in the first place, especially something like a business that requires a lot of effort.</p><p></p><p>In addition, not everyone also has a business idea that can be developed and is considered to be attractive to the market. While there are people who enjoy creating new business ideas, there are also people who are happy to enjoy the results of those ideas. This is very reasonable because if everyone thinks of selling, then <strong>who will buy?</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>2. Not Everyone Can Manage a Business</strong></p><p>In running a business, there are many things that must be taken care of, starting from <strong>product planning, directing the team, establishing relationships with clients or investors, to making decisions</strong> for the continuity of the company. And not everyone has these abilities and skills that make them able to manage a business.</p><p></p><p>This is certainly different from the tasks that are usually carried out by an employee in the team or division where he works, which are usually <strong>more focused</strong>. So someone can be very good at designing, but it's difficult to lead other people, let alone a team. Or maybe he has a brilliant idea for a business product, but is always nervous when it comes to dealing with clients or investors.</p><p></p><p><strong>3. Bigger Business RISKS</strong></p><p>Although doing business has the <strong>possibility to earn more money</strong>, it is also in line with<strong> the risks</strong> that arise. Not all businesses can run smoothly and immediately generate profits, especially if they have only been running them for a while. There is always the possibility that the business that is run will experience obstacles or even failure. This can make the owner have to spend more money, or even go bankrupt.</p><p></p><p>The risks that exist in business make many people feel that the road is not safe <strong>(insecure).</strong> In addition, more things will be sacrificed in running a business, especially time and energy. If working in an office only takes from 9 to 5 pm, doing business can take 24 hours a day. The energy that is devoted is even greater than working as an employee, especially for businesses that do not yet have many human resources.</p><p></p><p><strong>4. Employees Have Fixed Income</strong></p><p>A business can indeed generate abundant profits in one period, but it can also not produce at all. Even in the worst case, the business can actually suffer losses and create a financial deficit. Meanwhile, if you work as an employee, someone will get <strong>regular income every month</strong>.</p><p></p><p>Maybe it's not that much, but having regular income is more certain than doing business. Meanwhile, with or without fixed income, needs continue and expenses must be made. Therefore, many people prefer to be employees with a steady income rather than doing business.</p><p></p><p><strong>5. Already Comfortable with Work</strong></p><p>The next reason why people prefer to be employees is because they feel comfortable in their current job. They are happy with the work they do, or may have gotten used to it from doing it for some time. They are also more able to <strong>maximize their abilities and expertise by becoming employees</strong>, rather than having to try to do business.</p><p></p><p>Convenience at work is a very important thing to consider in choosing and pursuing a career. Basically, nothing is easy, everything has its own challenges and obstacles. Therefore, if we have found a job that we feel is suitable and comfortable, then the job is very worthy to be maintained.</p><p></p><p><strong>6. Have Different Views and Priorities</strong></p><p>Everyone has <strong>their own perspective</strong> on work and life, which makes them have different priorities. There are people who see that he must take risks for greater progress, there are also people who view that something stable is better. And there's really nothing wrong with either of those views.</p><p></p><p>------------------------</p><p>Let's learn about being employed is here:</p><p><strong>https://brainly.ph/question/4055139?referrer=searchResults</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>#SPJ2</strong></p><br />

                        One of the biggest motivations for becoming an entrepreneur is the unlimited income potential here; with the right timing and the right idea, you can build wealth that just isn't possible with a traditional career (granted, it's not that easy).<strong>Self-motivatio</strong><strong>.</strong>One of the most important traits of entrepreneurs is self-motivation. When you want to succeed, you need to be able to push yourself.
