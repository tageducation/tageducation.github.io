                                            4. Liza experienced to slide in a waterslide and the slide in the park. Shenoticed that she slides faster in the waterslide compared to the slide in thepark. Why is it? It is becauseA. waterslides are shortsB. waterslides are roughC. water reduces frictionD. water increases the force of gravityforce on you5. While you stand on the floor, the earth exerts adirectedA. gravitational - downwardB. frictional-downwardC. gravitational- upwardD. frictional- sideward6. Alex walked in a dry floor and Roy walked in a wet floor. Roy have adifficulty in walking. Why is it harder to walk on a wet floor than on a dryfloor? It is harder to walk on a wet floor becauseA the frictional force present in a wet floor is lesser than on a dry oneB. the frictional force present in a wet floor is greater than on a dry oneC. the gravitational force is present on the floorD. the gravity pushes Roy towards the floor7. Everything on Earth is in place because of gravity. What would happen ifthe Earth did not have any gravity?A. Life would cease to exist.B. All objects not anchored down on its surface would float.C. The moon would crash into the Earth.D. The lifespan of man and animals would drop sharply.8. The ball rolled on the grassy surface of the park and suddenly stop. Howdoes friction affect the motion of the ball?A. Friction affects the ability of the ball to take more rollingB. Friction decreases the time of the ball to take farther distance.C. Friction opposes the direction of the ball to change its directionD. Friction slows down the rolling of the ball and prevents the ballto move farther.paki tulong​</a>

The two <strong>car</strong> vehicles did not immediately stop as they hit the block of wood. The heavier car dragged the block of wood along a longer stopping distance than the <strong>lighter car</strong> did. The big truck had a <strong>greater stopping distance</strong>. The <strong>stopping distance increases</strong> as the point of release<strong> increases.</strong> Therefore, the big truck has a greater momentum because it possesses a greater inertia in motion which depends on an object’s <strong>mass and velocity</strong>.
The <strong>weight </strong>does play a role. u = F_friction/F_normal. F_normal is the force that presses the road and tyres together, i.e. the weight of the car, F_normal = mg.
<p>If we are comparing two cars, in your case a <strong>sedan car</strong> and a s<strong>ports car,</strong> assuming that the mass is different for both cars (m_sports &gt; m_sedan), say:
</p><p>g = 10N/kg
</p><p>m_sports = 2kg, F_sports = 2kg * g = 20N  </p><p>m_sedan = 1kg, F_sedan = 1kg * g = 10N
</p><p>say u = 1 for both cars,
</p><p>then the only way u can be constant is by F_friction of both cars to change accordingly,  </p><p>u_sedan = F_friction/F_sedan = 10N/10N = 1
</p><p>u_sports = F_friction/F_sports = 20N/20N = 1
</p><p>i.e. if the sports car has<strong> bigger mass</strong>, then the tyres need to be bigger as well. So if we say that u is constant, we are actually saying we are compensating for the mass of the cars with frictional force.
</p><p>In reality though, for the same v, two cars (sports and sedan)  do not have the same u, that is why you will see one go off a cliff.
</p><p></p>Theoretically it is but practically it is not. This is because of the varying operating variables such as normal loads (<strong>unladen and laden state)</strong> and load transfer effects during braking. As such, we can refer to<strong> EEC Directive</strong> 75/524 as guide for brake efficiency  and adhesion <strong>utilisation</strong> analyses in order to incorporate suitable brake bias or proportioning valves to ensure good efficiency or adhesion utilisation trough out the possible vehicle operating variables.  <p>

                        <strong>The </strong><strong>stopping </strong><strong>distance </strong><strong>for </strong><strong>the </strong><strong>heavy </strong><strong>truck </strong><strong>is </strong><strong>longer </strong><strong>than </strong><strong>the </strong><strong>stopping </strong><strong>distance </strong><strong>for </strong><strong>the </strong><strong>small </strong><strong>toy.</strong><p></p><p><strong>#</strong><strong>h</strong><strong>o</strong><strong>p</strong><strong>e</strong><strong> </strong><strong>it </strong><strong>helps</strong></p><p><strong>#</strong><strong>c</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>r</strong><strong>r</strong><strong>y</strong><strong> </strong><strong>on </strong><strong>learning </strong></p>Highway traffic and safety engineers have some general guidelines they have developed over the years and hold now as standards. As an example, if a street surface is dry, the average driver can safely decelerate an automobile or light truck with reasonably good tires at the rate of about 15 feet per second (fps). That is, a driver can slow down at this rate without anticipated probability that control of the vehicle will be lost in the process.<br />The measure of velocity is distance divided by time (fps), stated as feet per second. The measure of acceleration (or deceleration in this case) is feet per second per second. That assumes a reasonably good co-efficient of friction of about .75; better is .8 or higher while conditions or tire quality might yield a worse factor of .7 or lower.<br />No matter the velocity, that velocity is reduced 15 fps every second. If the initial velocity is 60 mph, 88 fps, after 1 second elapsed, the vehicle velocity would be 73 fps, after 2 seconds it would be 58 fps decreasing progressively thereafter. For the true mathematical perfectionist (one who carries PI to 1000 decimal places), it would have been technically correct to indicated the formula is 'fpsps' rather than 'fps', but far less understandable to most drivers. Since at speeds of 200 mph or less, the difference from one method to the other is in thousanths of seconds, our calculations in these examples are based on the simple fps calculations.<br />Given the previous set of conditions, it would mean that a driver could stop the described vehicle in a total of 6.87 seconds (including a 1 second delay for driver reaction) and your total stopping distance would be 302.28 feet, slightly more than a football field in length!<br />Virtually all current production vehicles' published road braking performance tests indicate stopping distances from 60 mph that are typically 120 to 140 feet, slightly less than half of the projected safety distances. While the figures are probably achievable, they are not realistic and certainly not average; they tend to be misleading and to those that actually read them, they create a false sense of security.<br />By increasing braking skills, drivers can significantly reduce both the time it takes to stop and the distance taken to stop a vehicle. Under closed course conditions, professional drivers frequently achieve 1g deceleration (32 fpsps) or better. A reasonably skilled driver could easily get deceleration rates in excess of 20 fpsps without loss of control. It is very possible and probable that with some effort, the driver that attempts to be aware of braking safety procedures and practices can and should get much better braking (safely) than the guidelines used nationally, approaching that of the professionally driver published performance tests.<br />

                            23. Set-up 2Step 1: Roll the ball on the surface of the table. With your stop watch, take the time for the ball to reach the ground upon leaving the table’s edge and mark the point on the groundwhere the ball landed.Step 2: Repeat step 1 but this time, roll the ball at faster rate.Step 3: Record your observationsGuide Questions:1. How would you compare the time of fall when you rolled the ball at varied rates?2. How would you compare the distances of the point where the ball landed on the ground from the table’s edge?3. What relationship can you draw between the initial rolling speeds of the ball and the distances where the ball landed on the ground?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.Divide the falling distance by 16. For example, if the object will fall 128 feet, divide 128 by 16 to get 8. Calculate the square root of the Step 2 result to find the time it takes the object to fall in seconds</p><p></p><p>2.For example, if the two points have coordinates (-3, 7) and (1, 2), then the difference between 7 and 2 is 5, and so Y = 5. Thus, the square of the distance between the coordinates is 41. Take the square root of D2 to find D, the actual distance between the two points.</p><p></p><p>3.Speed is the distance covered in a unit of time while acceleration is the rate of change of speed. The unit of speed in the metric system is meters per second (m/s) while that of acceleration is meters per second squared (m/s2).
