When he reached it, he discovered to his grief that it contained so little water that he could not possibly get at it.

At last, he collected as many stones as he could carry and dropped them one by one with his beak into the pitcher, until he brought the water within his reach and thus saved his life.1.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>1. How did you classify the different artworks into their respective periods? </strong>
</p><p>The artworks were classified due to their characteristics that are respective to their periods. Art historians and aesthetic philosophers employ a number of ways to group the world into systems of classification, known as periods. Periodization subdivides the continuous flow of artworks through time and space into groupings. Period groupings are defined by the perception that the artworks within them share a single or a set of qualities that are significant.  </p><p>
</p><p><strong>2. What is your basis of classification?</strong>
</p><p>Significant qualities can include the formal, stylistic, iconographic, thematic, or other aspects of art. Moreover, period groupings are further defined by the perception that or qualities by which each grouping is defined are distinctive.
