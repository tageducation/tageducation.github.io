                                            •	Title of the Book: The Notebook by Nicholas Sparks
•	Excerpt:
	Afterward I sit in the chair that has come to be shaped like me. They are finishing up now; her clothes are on, but still she is crying. It will become quieter after they leave, I know. The excitement of the morning always upsets her, and today is no exception. Finally the shade is opened and the nurses walk out. Both of them touch me and smile as they walk by. I wonder what this means.
I sit for just a second and stare at her, but she doesn't return the look. I understand, for she doesn't know who I am. I'm a stranger to her. Then, turning away, I bow my head and pray silently for the strength I know I will need. I have always been a firm believer in God and the power of prayer, though to be honest, my faith has made for a list of questions I definitely want answered after I'm gone.
Ready now. On go the glasses, out of my pocket comes a magnifier. I put it on the table for a moment while I open the notebook. It takes two licks on my gnarled finger to get the well-worn cover open to the first page. Then I put the magnifier in place.
There is always a moment right before I begin to read the story when my mind churns, and I wonder, Will it happen today? I don't know, for I never know beforehand, and deep down it really doesn't matter. It's the possibility that keeps me going, not the guarantee, a sort of wager on my part. And though you may call me a dreamer or fool or any other thing, I believe that anything is possible.
I realize the odds, and science, are against me. But science is not the total answer; this I know, this I have learned in my lifetime. And that leaves me with the belief that miracles, no matter how inexplicable or unbelievable, are real and can occur without regard to the natural order of things. So once again, just as I do every day, I begin to read the notebook aloud, so that she can hear it, in the hope that the miracle that has come to dominate my life will once again prevail.
And maybe, just maybe, it will.

                                            Breathe Tiffaney L. Ganci Panic, worry, darkness closing in around me. These are some of the words I could use to describe my anxiety, but nothing I can say could speak of its entirety, as I cry internally thinking I've lost my sanity. Doctors, counselors, saying there's something wrong with me. My parents telling me to calm down and stop being so crazy. But how can I calm down when the world around me is spinning out of control and I can barely see? Breathe. You will get through this. You will get through the sleepless nights, all the mal fights, and the days that seem right when the world hits you with all its might. Breathe. You will get through this. I know you think I'm overreacting about the silliest little things, but to me those silly little things seem like the doom the world could bring. Can't you see, a spilled glass of milk to you can seems like an earthquake to me. I know it might be hard to understand my anxiety, but I hope today I have given you some clarity. So the next time someone is scared and feels like they can't breathe, shaking and crying, unable to see, don't tell them they're overreacting; don't call them crazy. Help them realize there is more to life than this misery, and no matter the doubt inside, they will be who they are meant to be. Breathe. I will get through this. Because I know I am more than just my anxiety, and one day I hope to be free of it entirely. But until then, I will keep telling myself, quietly, I am stronger than this. I am stronger than my anxiety.1. what is the poem all about?2. what is the problem described in the poem ?3. in your own words explain the problem depicted in the poem.​</a>

                                            Directions: Read and analyze the reading passage. Answer the following questions
Traveling might be fun for some, but for me, it’s boring and tiring. First, I really hate talking to other people whom I just met for the first time. I am not a loner, but I find it scary to open up to people even just by letting them know what my name is. Second, since I don’t have my own car, commuting for me is woeful. Imagine transferring from one public vehicle to another. You can call me lazy, but I’d rather stay inside my house for the whole month-long vacation. Another one is that I am scared of being around too many people because I think a bomb will explode anytime. As much as I don’t want to be scared, news on television about places being bombed by terrorists is enough reason for me to stay at home. In addition, I don’t have the luxury of money to spend on food, lodging, and transportation, so I’d opt not to try traveling at all. You see, I have enough reasons not to indulge myself with traveling.

“I am the wisest man alive, for I know one thing, and that is, that I know nothing.” 
- (Socrates) Plato, The Republic
“All our knowledge begins with the senses, proceeds then to the understanding and ends with reason. There is nothing higher than reason.”
Immanuel Kant, Critique of Pure Reason
“And what more am I? I look for aid to the imagination. [But how mistakenly!] I am not the assemblage of limbs we call the human body; I am not subtle penetrating air distributed throughout all these members; I am not a wind, a fire, a vapor, a breath or anything at all that I can imagine. I am supposing all these things to be nothing. Yet I find, while so doing, that I am still assured that I am still something.”
Rene Descartes, Mediations on First Philosophy
“Look into the depths of your own soul and learn first to know yourself, then you will understand why this illness was bound to come upon you, perhaps you will 
thenceforth avoid falling ill.”
- Sigmund Freud, Character and Culture
“I discover that there are other minds in misunderstanding what other 
people say and do.”
- Gilbert Ryle, The Concept of the Mind
“Whether it’s a question of my body, the natural world, the past, birth or death, the question is always to know how I can be open to phenomena that transcend me and that, nevertheless, only exist to the extent that I take them up and live them.”
- Merleau-Ponty, Phenomenology of Perception</a>

                                            how messed up is this?!
 my mom turned off my phone number for 6 months unless I can get my grades up. (i have mostly d's and a couple of f's and one c...) and now my dad can't call me or use the tracker. no number means no tracker. and I have a hard time sleeping as it is. I wake up late a lot of the time but before I would have people call me in the mornings to wake me up. I have 2 alarms that go off. and yesterday I decided to use my third one. I still was late for school. I got to school about 15 minutes after the fifth period bell. rest of the school day was normal. looking for people, doing my work, try not to be alone, you know... after school was me trying to get the boy I like to notice me since he kept ignoring me. it was really hard to manage it. in the end, we sat at a table and we were talking for about two and a half hours. since my dad can't use the tracker anymore he left the house to look for me. when I saw him I had just gotten off the bus, but I didn't want to be picked up so I kept walking... when I got home I started to clean my room and a half was cleaning my desk he came home. he yelled at me for about 30 min about everything. I am blaming my mom for my dad having to come to find me. reason? she is the one that disabled my number. when we originally discussed my number it was just going to be restricted. but no. after he finished, I went to my room and cried for about 30 min. after I was ready I went to eat. when I was almost done he came and yelled at me AGAIN for the same things. the only thing that kept me calm was the fact that I was eating. (and reading...) so as you can tell, my life is hell for me. and I'm not even going to get into my love life... so please tell me what you think.</a>

                            4. •	Title of the Book: The Notebook by Nicholas Sparks
•	Excerpt:
	Afterward I sit in the chair that has come to be shaped like me. They are finishing up now; her clothes are on, but still she is crying. It will become quieter after they leave, I know. The excitement of the morning always upsets her, and today is no exception. Finally the shade is opened and the nurses walk out. Both of them touch me and smile as they walk by. I wonder what this means.
I sit for just a second and stare at her, but she doesn't return the look. I understand, for she doesn't know who I am. I'm a stranger to her. Then, turning away, I bow my head and pray silently for the strength I know I will need. I have always been a firm believer in God and the power of prayer, though to be honest, my faith has made for a list of questions I definitely want answered after I'm gone.
Ready now. On go the glasses, out of my pocket comes a magnifier. I put it on the table for a moment while I open the notebook. It takes two licks on my gnarled finger to get the well-worn cover open to the first page. Then I put the magnifier in place.
There is always a moment right before I begin to read the story when my mind churns, and I wonder, Will it happen today? I don't know, for I never know beforehand, and deep down it really doesn't matter. It's the possibility that keeps me going, not the guarantee, a sort of wager on my part. And though you may call me a dreamer or fool or any other thing, I believe that anything is possible.
I realize the odds, and science, are against me. But science is not the total answer; this I know, this I have learned in my lifetime. And that leaves me with the belief that miracles, no matter how inexplicable or unbelievable, are real and can occur without regard to the natural order of things. So once again, just as I do every day, I begin to read the notebook aloud, so that she can hear it, in the hope that the miracle that has come to dominate my life will once again prevail.
And maybe, just maybe, it will.
Question:
1.	What can you infer from the excerpt?
Answer:</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>From the excerpt, it can be inferred that the speaker is an elderly man who visits a woman in a hospital who seems to have memory loss or amnesia. He is familiar with the woman and is in the habit of reading to her from a notebook which contains a story. The woman appears upset and emotional, but the speaker believes that the story in the notebook may have the power to bring her comfort and healing. He expresses his faith in God and miracles, which he hopes will help the woman recover her memory.</p><br />

                            13. Breathe Tiffaney L. Ganci Panic, worry, darkness closing in around me. These are some of the words I could use to describe my anxiety, but nothing I can say could speak of its entirety, as I cry internally thinking I've lost my sanity. Doctors, counselors, saying there's something wrong with me. My parents telling me to calm down and stop being so crazy. But how can I calm down when the world around me is spinning out of control and I can barely see? Breathe. You will get through this. You will get through the sleepless nights, all the mal fights, and the days that seem right when the world hits you with all its might. Breathe. You will get through this. I know you think I'm overreacting about the silliest little things, but to me those silly little things seem like the doom the world could bring. Can't you see, a spilled glass of milk to you can seems like an earthquake to me. I know it might be hard to understand my anxiety, but I hope today I have given you some clarity. So the next time someone is scared and feels like they can't breathe, shaking and crying, unable to see, don't tell them they're overreacting; don't call them crazy. Help them realize there is more to life than this misery, and no matter the doubt inside, they will be who they are meant to be. Breathe. I will get through this. Because I know I am more than just my anxiety, and one day I hope to be free of it entirely. But until then, I will keep telling myself, quietly, I am stronger than this. I am stronger than my anxiety.1. what is the poem all about?2. what is the problem described in the poem ?3. in your own words explain the problem depicted in the poem.​</h2><br />

                            14. Directions: Read and analyze the reading passage. Answer the following questions
Traveling might be fun for some, but for me, it’s boring and tiring. First, I really hate talking to other people whom I just met for the first time. I am not a loner, but I find it scary to open up to people even just by letting them know what my name is. Second, since I don’t have my own car, commuting for me is woeful. Imagine transferring from one public vehicle to another. You can call me lazy, but I’d rather stay inside my house for the whole month-long vacation. Another one is that I am scared of being around too many people because I think a bomb will explode anytime. As much as I don’t want to be scared, news on television about places being bombed by terrorists is enough reason for me to stay at home. In addition, I don’t have the luxury of money to spend on food, lodging, and transportation, so I’d opt not to try traveling at all. You see, I have enough reasons not to indulge myself with traveling.

“I am the wisest man alive, for I know one thing, and that is, that I know nothing.” 
- (Socrates) Plato, The Republic
“All our knowledge begins with the senses, proceeds then to the understanding and ends with reason. There is nothing higher than reason.”
Immanuel Kant, Critique of Pure Reason
“And what more am I? I look for aid to the imagination. [But how mistakenly!] I am not the assemblage of limbs we call the human body; I am not subtle penetrating air distributed throughout all these members; I am not a wind, a fire, a vapor, a breath or anything at all that I can imagine. I am supposing all these things to be nothing. Yet I find, while so doing, that I am still assured that I am still something.”
Rene Descartes, Mediations on First Philosophy
“Look into the depths of your own soul and learn first to know yourself, then you will understand why this illness was bound to come upon you, perhaps you will 
thenceforth avoid falling ill.”
- Sigmund Freud, Character and Culture
“I discover that there are other minds in misunderstanding what other 
people say and do.”
- Gilbert Ryle, The Concept of the Mind
“Whether it’s a question of my body, the natural world, the past, birth or death, the question is always to know how I can be open to phenomena that transcend me and that, nevertheless, only exist to the extent that I take them up and live them.”

                            27. how messed up is this?!
 my mom turned off my phone number for 6 months unless I can get my grades up. (i have mostly d's and a couple of f's and one c...) and now my dad can't call me or use the tracker. no number means no tracker. and I have a hard time sleeping as it is. I wake up late a lot of the time but before I would have people call me in the mornings to wake me up. I have 2 alarms that go off. and yesterday I decided to use my third one. I still was late for school. I got to school about 15 minutes after the fifth period bell. rest of the school day was normal. looking for people, doing my work, try not to be alone, you know... after school was me trying to get the boy I like to notice me since he kept ignoring me. it was really hard to manage it. in the end, we sat at a table and we were talking for about two and a half hours. since my dad can't use the tracker anymore he left the house to look for me. when I saw him I had just gotten off the bus, but I didn't want to be picked up so I kept walking... when I got home I started to clean my room and a half was cleaning my desk he came home. he yelled at me for about 30 min about everything. I am blaming my mom for my dad having to come to find me. reason? she is the one that disabled my number. when we originally discussed my number it was just going to be restricted. but no. after he finished, I went to my room and cried for about 30 min. after I was ready I went to eat. when I was almost done he came and yelled at me AGAIN for the same things. the only thing that kept me calm was the fact that I was eating. (and reading...) so as you can tell, my life is hell for me. and I'm not even going to get into my love life... so please tell me what you think.</h2><br />
