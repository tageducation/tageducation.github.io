What are the advantages and disadvantages of your top suggested solution? 3. Is it something worth pursuing? Why? ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer/Explanation: </strong></p><p>First of all, It's so sad to hear about Betty's situation. Here are some solutions which I can think of. </p><p> First, She should advise her teacher that she would take some time off in her school, she is not going to drop out but she will just need some time to take care of her family. I believe the school is generous and they will understand her situation since her mother was tested positive with comorbidity, she should first seek help from the Local Government Unit starting from her Baranggay so they can guide her on which hostpital they can go to. </p><p>Second, once her mother is already admitted to the hospital, she can now process the government health insurance if she can. She can also ask some of her relatives if she doesn't have siblings to help her. But since she is a student, an adult relative would be a great help. </p><p>Third, About her father, a lot of people lost their job due to the pandemic. The best thing to do is to convince her father to not give up and to look for anohter safe job which they badly needed. In this situation, giving up is not an option so the best thing they could do is to help each other. </p><p>These are some solutions that I can think of. The advanatges is that it is very easy to think of step by step but the disadvantage is that her priority will change for the meantime. </p><p></p><p></p><p>#BRAINLYFAST</p><p></p><p></p><br />
