                                            ACTIONS WHAT MUST BE DONE BEFORE THE ACTION?
1. Buying new clothes. 
*Buy the best you can afford. Cheap may get you through in the short term, but tends to fall apart, then you have to buy more and end up spending a lot anyway.
2. Choosing friends. 
*Earn the trust and love
3. Eating food. 
*Pick what you can only eat
4. Deciding where to study for Senior High School. 
*Plan
5. Attending classes in the afternoon. 
*Eating lunch-because it provides energy and nutrients to keep the body and brain working efficiently through the afternoon. Afternoon classes are fun and somewhat tiring as well.
6. Going to school. 
*Leave at least 10-15 minutes before school starts so you will get there in time. Check your school schedule and then pack all the required things. Pack an emergency kit for school. This could include a hair tie, perfume, deodorant, pads or tampons, lip balm and ask first what he/she needs not wants.
7. Visiting a friend. 
*Ask permission to your Mother before leaving.
8. Joining an organization in school. 
*Participate
9. Playing computer games. 
*Make sure that your playing a below +18 games. Know what is right for your age to avoid addiction of the game that leads to serious mind trouble or even death.
10. Buying a new gadget. 
*Earn money
11. Asking permission if you would like to go out with friends. 
*First think of the questions that they might ask you; will it give you benefits? Will you be happy, but in the right way? Are you responsible for your actions? How will you go home?? They just want the best for you, make sure to also follow them in case they allowed you to go with your friends.
12. Helping a stranger. 
*Show the love
13. Traveling without your family. 
*You should finish your studies and have a job and get a lot of money and then you can travel. but it will be nice if you travel with your loved ones/ family.
14. Going to mass or any religious activities. 
*First of all we need to make sure our safety, avoid talking closely to someone make sure you guys have social distancing, clean anything that you touch such as chair,table and more and lastly make sure you are wearing face mask.
15. Watching movies that are not allowed for your age. 
*First, make sure that the movies are good for your age. If it's not, then you'll pick another movie.
16. .Posting your opinion or feelings in the social media. 
*Be responsible for your actions
17. Communicating to your siblings about a conflict. 
*Calm both yourselves first and do a deep reflection. Reflection means going back to what you think have gone wrong between the two of you, what mistakes you both done and how are you going to accept that you both made a mistake.
18. Giving opinions. 
*First, make sure that the situation is related with your opinion. 2. Ask yourself if you have the best opinion. 3. Lastly, think before you speak your opinions and make sure you have detailed opinions to avoid quarrels and misunderstanding.
19. Going out with the opposite sex. 
*Earn trust (again)
20. Confronting a person who verbally hurt you. 
*Have the courage

                                            Reflection About this short story
THE BLIND BUS PASSENGER
It had been a year since Susan, 34, became blind. Due to a medical
misdiagnosis she had been rendered sightless, and she was suddenly thrown
into a world of darkness, anger, frustration and self-pity. And all she had
to cling to was her husband, Mark.
Mark was an Army officer and he loved Susan with all his heart. When she
first lost her sight, he watched her sink into despair and was determined to
help his wife gain the strength and confidence she needed to become
independent again.
Finally, Susan felt ready to return to her job, but how would she get there?
She used to take the bus, but was now too frightened to get around the city
by herself. Mark volunteered to drive her to work each day, even though they
worked at opposite ends of the city. At first, this comforted Susan, and
fulfilled Mark's need to protect his sightless wife who was so insecure
about performing the slightest task. Soon, however, Mark realized the arrangement
wasn't working. Susan is going to have to start taking the bus again, he
admitted to himself. But she was still so fragile, so angry - how would she react?
Just as he predicted, Susan was horrified at the idea of taking the bus
again. "I'm blind!", she responded bitterly. "How am I supposed to know
where I am going? I feel like you're abandoning me."
Mark's heart broke to hear these words, but he knew what had to be done.
He promised Susan that each morning and evening he would ride the bus with
her, for as long as it took, until she got the hang of it.
And that is exactly what happened. For two solid weeks, Mark, military
uniform and all, accompanied Susan to and from work each day. He taught her
how to rely on her other senses, specifically her hearing, to determine
where she was and how to adapt to her new environment. He helped her
befriend the bus drivers who could watch out for her, and save her a seat.
Finally, Susan decided that she was ready to try the trip on her own.
Monday morning arrived, and before she left, she threw her arms around Mark,
her temporary bus-riding companion, her husband, and her best friend. Her
eyes filled with tears of gratitude for his loyalty, his patience, and his love.
She said good-bye, and for the first time, they went their separate ways.
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday... Each day on her own went perfectly,
and Susan had never felt better. She was doing it! She was going to work all by herself.
On Friday morning, Susan took the bus to work as usual. As she was paying
the fare to exit the bus, the driver said, "Boy, I sure do envy you."
Susan wasn't sure if the driver was speaking to her or not. After all, who
on earth would ever envy a blind woman who had struggled just to find the
courage to live for the past year? Curious, she asked the driver, "Why do
you say that you envy me?"
The driver responded, "It must feel good to be taken care of and protected like you are."
Susan had no idea what the driver was talking about, and again asked, "What do you mean?"
The driver answered, "You know, every morning for the past week, a fine
looking gentleman in a military uniform has been standing across the corner
watching you as you get off the bus. He makes sure you cross the street
safely and he watches until you enter your office building. Then he blows
you a kiss, gives you a little salute and walks away. You are one lucky lady."
Tears of happiness poured down Susan's cheeks. For although she couldn't
physically see him, she had always felt Mark's presence. She was lucky, so
lucky, for he had given her a gift more powerful than sight, a gift she
didn't need to see to believe - the gift of love that can bring light where
there is darkness.</a>

Perhaps, since I am a high school student, somebody might say that I have my entire life ahead of me, with all of its beautiful experiences. But despite being so young, I already have a personal breathtaking experience, which, I am sure I will carry with me until my last days. What I am talking about here is my first hike to the mountains. *7. Sexuality education may even cause harm because of the distorted and biased views about premarital contact. It is time to give students more comprehensive and compendious sex education programs that will better prepare them for the future. *8. Though cellphones are necessary for high school students in terms of their safety, they should still be prohibited from use in school. This concept is founded on several reasons, such as disrupting the educational process and facilitating students’ cheating; distracting students by the possibility to access the Internet, social media, or communicate with friends; finally cellphones contribute to the spreading of the social phenomenon known as cyber bullying. *9. The Great Wall, or Chang Cheng in Chinese, is massive. It begins in the east of the Yellow Sea,travels near China’s capital, Beijing, and continues west through numerous provinces. For thousands of miles, it winds like a snake through China’s varied terrain. Smaller walls extend from the main wall.According to the conservative estimates, the Great Wall’s lengths is approximately 2400 miles. Its thickness ranges from 15-30 feet wide, and it reaches in height to about 25 feet. For many centuries, the Great Wall has been considered one of the world’s wonders. (Turnbull &amp; Noon, 2007). *10. Historically, the word Halloween is a contraction from the phrase All Hollows Even, which meant the day before All Hollows Day. It is a Catholic holiday dedicated to the commemoration of saints and martyrs for faith; today, though, we know it more as a holiday of trick-or-treating, scary costumes, and entourage, and funny pranks. Gradually, Halloween has lost its religious connotations, and has turned onto a holiday gladly celebrated by youth and adults across the Western world on October 31. *11. When we take into account how many celebrities used illegal drugs, how unstable their family lives are, and how much crime they commit, we can infer that celebrities should not be celebrated as they are. It is in my opinion that celebrities are worse off than non-celebrities – we should instead honor ourselves with self-esteem, self-confidence and self-reliance. We do not need to look up to famous individuals who can be termed by-and-large as criminals, illegal drug users, and down-and-out family members. Despite the veil of their success, on the whole, they are rather miserable examples of human beings that should not be given the honor they have incurred. *12. It was the 4th of July in blistering Nebraska, America’s Independence Day. As usual on every Independence Day since I was five years old, George and Terry, my two best friends, and I went on a picnic. I diligently carried out my household chores, packed my picnic bag, and off I went to collect my friends by way of a bicycle. It is going to be an awesome day. I thought to myself as I sped down my neighborhood street on my beat-up blue Schwinn. *13. Antibiotics were invented by Alexander Flemming in 1928 (Diggins). Antibiotics are chemical substances produced by various microorganisms and other living systems, and capable of inhibiting the growth of dangerous bacteria and viruses. Before the epoch of antibiotics began, there was not much that could be done for patients suffering from different infections, and death rates were not much higher than today. *14. Living in the city is hard, even for those who were born in the industrialized environment of crowded streets, huge supermarkets, crammed subways, and polluting factories. I was born and raised in Dallas, so I know first-hand about heavy traffic and five-level interchange roads. *15. Terrorists cannot continue their actions if they are prosecuted and detained. Grounds for criminal prosecution include UN security Council resolutions and outstanding U.S. indictments (Scheffer, 2001).Circumstances surrounding the attempted use of these grounds to prosecute terrorists activities are not always favorable. * ​</a>

                            18. Reflection About this short story
THE BLIND BUS PASSENGER
It had been a year since Susan, 34, became blind. Due to a medical
misdiagnosis she had been rendered sightless, and she was suddenly thrown
into a world of darkness, anger, frustration and self-pity. And all she had
to cling to was her husband, Mark.
Mark was an Army officer and he loved Susan with all his heart. When she
first lost her sight, he watched her sink into despair and was determined to
help his wife gain the strength and confidence she needed to become
independent again.
Finally, Susan felt ready to return to her job, but how would she get there?
She used to take the bus, but was now too frightened to get around the city
by herself. Mark volunteered to drive her to work each day, even though they
worked at opposite ends of the city. At first, this comforted Susan, and
fulfilled Mark's need to protect his sightless wife who was so insecure
about performing the slightest task. Soon, however, Mark realized the arrangement
wasn't working. Susan is going to have to start taking the bus again, he
admitted to himself. But she was still so fragile, so angry - how would she react?
Just as he predicted, Susan was horrified at the idea of taking the bus
again. "I'm blind!", she responded bitterly. "How am I supposed to know
where I am going? I feel like you're abandoning me."
Mark's heart broke to hear these words, but he knew what had to be done.
He promised Susan that each morning and evening he would ride the bus with
her, for as long as it took, until she got the hang of it.
And that is exactly what happened. For two solid weeks, Mark, military
uniform and all, accompanied Susan to and from work each day. He taught her
how to rely on her other senses, specifically her hearing, to determine
where she was and how to adapt to her new environment. He helped her
befriend the bus drivers who could watch out for her, and save her a seat.
Finally, Susan decided that she was ready to try the trip on her own.
Monday morning arrived, and before she left, she threw her arms around Mark,
her temporary bus-riding companion, her husband, and her best friend. Her
eyes filled with tears of gratitude for his loyalty, his patience, and his love.
She said good-bye, and for the first time, they went their separate ways.
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday... Each day on her own went perfectly,
and Susan had never felt better. She was doing it! She was going to work all by herself.
On Friday morning, Susan took the bus to work as usual. As she was paying
the fare to exit the bus, the driver said, "Boy, I sure do envy you."
Susan wasn't sure if the driver was speaking to her or not. After all, who
on earth would ever envy a blind woman who had struggled just to find the
courage to live for the past year? Curious, she asked the driver, "Why do
you say that you envy me?"
The driver responded, "It must feel good to be taken care of and protected like you are."
Susan had no idea what the driver was talking about, and again asked, "What do you mean?"
The driver answered, "You know, every morning for the past week, a fine
looking gentleman in a military uniform has been standing across the corner
watching you as you get off the bus. He makes sure you cross the street
safely and he watches until you enter your office building. Then he blows
you a kiss, gives you a little salute and walks away. You are one lucky lady."
Tears of happiness poured down Susan's cheeks. For although she couldn't
physically see him, she had always felt Mark's presence. She was lucky, so
lucky, for he had given her a gift more powerful than sight, a gift she
didn't need to see to believe - the gift of love that can bring light where
there is darkness.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>While reading this short story I had realized something in life. I had realized that not all things go as planned or as we thought it would. Like in the story wherein Susan had become blind and has been living in the darkness for a year. Although it hurts to accept it and we constantly ask ourselves why this happened to us we still tried to accept it and live normally because we know that the reason god had let this happen to us was because he had plans for us and for our well-being.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>sana po makatulong</p><br />

Perhaps, since I am a high school student, somebody might say that I have my entire life ahead of me, with all of its beautiful experiences. But despite being so young, I already have a personal breathtaking experience, which, I am sure I will carry with me until my last days. What I am talking about here is my first hike to the mountains. *7. Sexuality education may even cause harm because of the distorted and biased views about premarital contact. It is time to give students more comprehensive and compendious sex education programs that will better prepare them for the future. *8. Though cellphones are necessary for high school students in terms of their safety, they should still be prohibited from use in school. This concept is founded on several reasons, such as disrupting the educational process and facilitating students’ cheating; distracting students by the possibility to access the Internet, social media, or communicate with friends; finally cellphones contribute to the spreading of the social phenomenon known as cyber bullying. *9. The Great Wall, or Chang Cheng in Chinese, is massive. It begins in the east of the Yellow Sea,travels near China’s capital, Beijing, and continues west through numerous provinces. For thousands of miles, it winds like a snake through China’s varied terrain. Smaller walls extend from the main wall.According to the conservative estimates, the Great Wall’s lengths is approximately 2400 miles. Its thickness ranges from 15-30 feet wide, and it reaches in height to about 25 feet. For many centuries, the Great Wall has been considered one of the world’s wonders. (Turnbull &amp; Noon, 2007). *10. Historically, the word Halloween is a contraction from the phrase All Hollows Even, which meant the day before All Hollows Day. It is a Catholic holiday dedicated to the commemoration of saints and martyrs for faith; today, though, we know it more as a holiday of trick-or-treating, scary costumes, and entourage, and funny pranks. Gradually, Halloween has lost its religious connotations, and has turned onto a holiday gladly celebrated by youth and adults across the Western world on October 31. *11. When we take into account how many celebrities used illegal drugs, how unstable their family lives are, and how much crime they commit, we can infer that celebrities should not be celebrated as they are. It is in my opinion that celebrities are worse off than non-celebrities – we should instead honor ourselves with self-esteem, self-confidence and self-reliance. We do not need to look up to famous individuals who can be termed by-and-large as criminals, illegal drug users, and down-and-out family members. Despite the veil of their success, on the whole, they are rather miserable examples of human beings that should not be given the honor they have incurred. *12. It was the 4th of July in blistering Nebraska, America’s Independence Day. As usual on every Independence Day since I was five years old, George and Terry, my two best friends, and I went on a picnic. I diligently carried out my household chores, packed my picnic bag, and off I went to collect my friends by way of a bicycle. It is going to be an awesome day. I thought to myself as I sped down my neighborhood street on my beat-up blue Schwinn. *13. Antibiotics were invented by Alexander Flemming in 1928 (Diggins). Antibiotics are chemical substances produced by various microorganisms and other living systems, and capable of inhibiting the growth of dangerous bacteria and viruses. Before the epoch of antibiotics began, there was not much that could be done for patients suffering from different infections, and death rates were not much higher than today. *14. Living in the city is hard, even for those who were born in the industrialized environment of crowded streets, huge supermarkets, crammed subways, and polluting factories. I was born and raised in Dallas, so I know first-hand about heavy traffic and five-level interchange roads. *15. Terrorists cannot continue their actions if they are prosecuted and detained. Grounds for criminal prosecution include UN security Council resolutions and outstanding U.S. indictments (Scheffer, 2001).Circumstances surrounding the attempted use of these grounds to prosecute terrorists activities are not always favorable. * ​</h2><br />
