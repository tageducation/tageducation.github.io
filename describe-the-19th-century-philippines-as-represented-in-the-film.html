                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.Describe the 19th century Philippines as represented in the film.The Philippines during the 19th century was under the colony of Spain as represented inthe film "Ganito kami Noon, Paano Kayo Ngayon". It was shown that the priest were powerfulthat time for they have close connections with the Spanish government as well as they haveenough wealth. Filipinos were living in fear because of the cruelty of the Spaniards that is why,some of them were living in mountainous area to hide themselves.2.Based on your reading, what can you say about the film's representation of the 19thcentury?Based on my reading, the film has really interpreted the situation of the Philippinesduring the 19th century. Slavery is very evident as well as abuse of authority was there. Beingagainst with the government is like a suicidal act that is why, revolutionary groups are verycareful with every actions that they are planning to do. On the other hand, being friend with thepriest and the government is an advantage for they could help you in trouble. </p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The following are the developments that I have read from the work written by Schumacher.  The Philippines exported great amounts of rice due to the increase in demand which resulted in great profits to provinces that focuses on agriculture which flourished the economy of the country. Filipinos were deprived of career positions because of the rampant graft and corruption within the bureaucracy. In line with the corrupt governance, they were unable to provide the basic needs for some sectors as a result of the officials mostly pocketing the funds. The taxation system also affected the modernization of the infrastructures as well as some equipment needed for agricultural progress. The cultural developments in the country greatly benefitted from the educational improvements due to the return of the Jesuits instituting primary and secondary schools for the Filipinos. Having educational access for the Filipinos has enlightened them about literature science and philosophy as well as principles in human dignity, justice, and equality, thus, opening their eyes to the reality of their situation under Spanish control. Due to the rise of nationalism among the ilustrados, they have become anti-friar or against the Catholic religion that was run by friars who were abusive of their authority. Most of the great personalities or heroes during the 19th century had their conflicts against the Spanish friars that have led to the execution of GomBurZa. However, later on, Filipino priests were then handed the authority to the parishes due to the lack of friars by the end of the century which gave way to the rights of the Filipino clergymen, serving them justice. </p><p>Students also viewed</p><p>3 - Content and Contextual Analysis for Selected Primary Resources II</p><p>Content and Contextual Analysis for Selected Primary Resources</p><p>G Erizal J.B.

Important as a stimulus to trade was the gradual elimination of the monopoly enjoyed by the galleon to Acapulco. The last galleon arrived in Manila in 1815, and by the mid-1830s Manila was open to foreign merchants almost without restriction. The demand for Philippine sugar and abaca (hemp) grew apace, and the volume of exports to Europe expanded even further after the completion of the Suez Canal in 1869.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p>The play was well cast, the entire Bliss family did a great job showing how overly dramatic and deceitful the family had become. Each actor portrayed their character accurately; there were no standouts that didn’t match the character. Each visitor in the first act seemed to be feasible as far as the possibility of a relationship was concerned. All of the family members acted genuine. There was one actor who stood out as a perfect fit for his character. Taylor Rascher played Simon Bliss and played him perfectly. Rascher’s character Simon was a young man who was dramatic and romantic so much so it was almost to the point of ridiculousness. Rascher stole the show in the first act when he was romancing with MichelleHay Fever was a comical play with a strong message. The actors throughout this play steadily used others to gain their own attention. The message this play left behind after many laughs was do not use others, plain and simple.</p><p>The space was a well-constructed thrust stage however, the stage was not raised off the ground and the seats appeared to be mobile which lead to the belief that this is an Environmental Theater. As for the layout of the stage, there was a couch and a table in center stage for the first two acts, a door to the unseen outside front of the house upstage right, there were two large double doors upstage center leading to the backyard garden, and a raised floor upstage left containing a piano, a bookcase and a door leading to the home library. Stage left there was a half spiral staircase that lead up to the second floor which had a painting and lights that extended across to stage right. The second floor also contained the bedrooms for the house but the doors were not in sight. The detail was greater than expected: the hardwood floor throughout the first floor seemed to be genuine, the actual bookcase filled with real books not stage books, and the extremely large double doors with translucent glass and floral designs lead to the Garden, which featured an array of plants behind the doors. The entire space was well lit for the duration of the play; the stage took place inside the Bliss’ home so the bright lighting added a confortable feel to the inside of the house. The theatre was nearly sold out; it was hard to spot an empty seat, including the balcony and lower level seating. The crowd contained nearly an even amount of student audience members and senior citizens; there was few in the audience that appeared middle aged.</p><p> Luz, who plays Myra Arundel. Rascher was displaying his love for Michelle Luz (Myra) in the most dramatic of fashions; he was playing the Bliss’ game of pretending to be in complete love with someone and then a moment later change his mind. Rascher was proclaiming his love with elegant speeches and coddling up next to her and eventually kissing her. Rascher made this scene particularly hilarious because he was completely over the top in typical Bliss fashion. Of course, all of this was for naught because Luz ended up kissing Joe Hubbard’s character David Bliss in act two and also Rascher proclaimed his engagement to Caitlin Stagemoller’s character, Jackie Coryton. Rascher made his voice more shrill and audible to appear to be more dramatic and create more attention for himself. In the same way, Rascher used grander gestures with his arms (flailing, waving, etc.) to cause a more dramatic effect.</p><br />

That Fr. John Schumacher, SJ, was also the foremost authority on the history of the Philippine Church helps explain his appeal to generations of Filipino Catholics. As the man who succeeded him as Church historian at the Loyola School of Theology, Fr. Tony de Castro, SJ, said in his moving homily at the funeral Mass last Saturday, it was Father Jack who made him realize it was possible to be “faithful to both the Church and the  nation.”</p><p></p><p>To my mind, Father Jack’s “Revolutionary Clergy” was the epitome of that integrated faith.
