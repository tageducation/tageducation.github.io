                                            You were not able to prepare for your graded report in Oral Communication. Mr. Reyes, then calls you to go to the front and start your presentation. How are you going to explain your situation yo your teacher?    In this situation, the first thing I would do is to admit that I was not able to prepare for the presentation and explain why. After I finish explaining to Mr. Reyes the reason why I was unprepared, I would then gladly accept the mistake I made and face all the consequences that will come with it. Once I've come to terms with my mistake, I would then apologize to Mr. Reyes for the mishap I have caused. Then, I would ask him if I can redo, the presentation, and do anything to get the grade, if I were given the chance.Your cousin, Karl, calls you over the phone and tells you that he cannot help you in your errand because he needs to do something for his school project. What will you tell him to convince him to spare you a bit of his time and that you need him to buy the surprise birthday gift for your father?    I would politely ask Karl again if he can help me with my errand. I would tell him that I would help him with his school project after we finish the errand. I would also tell him that sparing a bit of his time is already a big help and that I'd appreciate it if he helps me. Once he agrees, I would also promise him that he can also call me when he needs help on another errand.You are about to start with your report which you have failed to prepare for when your mother calls you on your mobile phone. How are you going to respond to your mother? What will you tell her?    I would answer the call first to check with my mother if it was an urgent call. If she tells me that it wasn't urgent, then I would politely ask my mother to wait for me to call her back, as I am about to do a presentation. However, if the call was urgent, I would first ask my teacher if I can spare a few minutes for my mother. If the teacher does not approve, then I will just try to listen to her on speaker phone as I do my presentation.You are in the middle of your discussion about the Tree-Planting Initiative of your school but you noticed that the District Supervisor is not really paying attention to what you are saying. How will you address the Supervisor respectfully?    If I saw the supervisor was not listening to me, I would politely ask him for his opinion. This is a strategy to get his attention without disrespecting their authority.You are already on your way home when your best friend, Diego, approaches you and asks for your help with his graded report tomorrow. You know that you need to go home early because of the surprise birthday party for your father but you also see the concerned look on your best friend. What will you do and what are you going to tell Diego?    First, I would check up on the time to see if I have extra time before the party starts. If I have enough time, I would help Diego with his report. However, if there wasn't enough time before the party, I would ask Diego if I can just help him after the party. If he tells me that he's not available after the party, then I would help him find someone to help him with the project instead. I would've asked him to come over at the party, so that we can do it there, but I would not risk it since it would be disrespectful to my family.​</a>

For me, deciding whether to go out or not is like a death and life situated. But five days before Christmas, I went out with a friend without thinking twice or thrice. Did I regret it? I didn’t. Because even though I wasn’t in my comfort zone, it felt like I was still at home. My friend invited me to go out as planned, and it was supposed to be happening five days after. But since I thought I have to, I agreed to her right away. Two o’clock was the set time, but we left twenty minutes after three in the afternoon. She informed me just thirty minutes before two and I had so much to do. I was ready to go, locked the door, and walked. I opened my umbrella and put my backpack in front of me. From Tanay Park, we planned to go to the town’s dike often called as “Dike ng Tanay”. After how many days, ngayon na lang ako ulit nakalabas,” I said to her as we walked. We were happy though it was sunny and hot. We talked a lot about anything that mostly made us laugh. We even shared insights about our studies. The sun was still there maintaining the warmness and humid of the air, but we managed to arrive without any complaint. When we were just meters away, I asked her to take a photo of me while walking towards the dike. “Continue, stop, continue,” she reminded. Once we got there, we sat on the bench, facing the picturesque and calm view of the lake. We took photos from the dike to the magnificent lighthouse of Tanay, the abundant water lilies on the shore, colorful boats, blue and clear sky and the busy road where people were enjoying the sunset view of Tanay Dike. After spending an hour doing a lot of things, we decided to leave and to go to another place. We were now going to the nearby dike. It took us twice the time and distance. There, we had some complaints of tiredness. Our feet were already aching, and we were really tired walking. Despite quitting, we ignored it and just talked and laughed. As we go nearer the place, we have seen the sun was about to set, and we did not notice the air was becoming cooler as the time passed by. It was getting dark and the streetlights were starting to open. It was a comfortable feeling especially when the people started walking out. Suddenly, I thought of the things that sadden me. The things I wish I could and couldn’t have. Then I remembered how long I have run before. I became motivated, thinking of the idea that I would never get rid of this feeling wherever I go. Someday, I guess, I’d be loving to hang out with friends while travelling the world together. Life won’t run in your comfort zone throughout the years, and I.​</a>

Not even a year. But <strong>we feel like we have played an important role in my life recently each other</strong>, like a very best friend and just like my family. We had never met face to face before. Our first acquaintance happened through social media. I admit that the social media I used at that time was social media to find new networks. Meet new people and want to interact looking for new knowledge and insights. And it seems fate brought us together at that time.</p><p></p><p>As usual, the interaction of introducing strangers through social media always starts with something strange, awkward and so on. But I feel he is open enough to want to get to know each other. Even though according to his confession, he is an introvert who is often awkward in interacting. Likewise with me, who is also an introvert. So the interaction is an interaction of endless awkwardness.</p><p></p><p>Starting from that tour, we got to know each other and continue to interact to this day. Even today I see him as someone who can give objective considerations when I lose my mind to be objective. Many things then made us support each other including in terms of achieving dreams and a better future. And of course we try to keep the interactions that occur to be positive. For me, finding someone like this friend might be a gift. Because after a long time without having a close friend, I was met with good people who can continue to give me hope. He was one of those few people.</p><p></p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p><p><strong>I do not deny that indeed a friend in the journey of human life is an important thing.</strong> They can be fun friends, but they can also be teachers who make us realize the blind sides that other people often take advantage of.</p><p></p><p>See more about 5 samples of appreciation words​:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/17609393</p><p></p><p>#SPJ2</p><br />

                            6. You were not able to prepare for your graded report in Oral Communication. Mr. Reyes, then calls you to go to the front and start your presentation. How are you going to explain your situation yo your teacher?    In this situation, the first thing I would do is to admit that I was not able to prepare for the presentation and explain why. After I finish explaining to Mr. Reyes the reason why I was unprepared, I would then gladly accept the mistake I made and face all the consequences that will come with it. Once I've come to terms with my mistake, I would then apologize to Mr. Reyes for the mishap I have caused. Then, I would ask him if I can redo, the presentation, and do anything to get the grade, if I were given the chance.Your cousin, Karl, calls you over the phone and tells you that he cannot help you in your errand because he needs to do something for his school project. What will you tell him to convince him to spare you a bit of his time and that you need him to buy the surprise birthday gift for your father?    I would politely ask Karl again if he can help me with my errand. I would tell him that I would help him with his school project after we finish the errand. I would also tell him that sparing a bit of his time is already a big help and that I'd appreciate it if he helps me. Once he agrees, I would also promise him that he can also call me when he needs help on another errand.You are about to start with your report which you have failed to prepare for when your mother calls you on your mobile phone. How are you going to respond to your mother? What will you tell her?    I would answer the call first to check with my mother if it was an urgent call. If she tells me that it wasn't urgent, then I would politely ask my mother to wait for me to call her back, as I am about to do a presentation. However, if the call was urgent, I would first ask my teacher if I can spare a few minutes for my mother. If the teacher does not approve, then I will just try to listen to her on speaker phone as I do my presentation.You are in the middle of your discussion about the Tree-Planting Initiative of your school but you noticed that the District Supervisor is not really paying attention to what you are saying. How will you address the Supervisor respectfully?    If I saw the supervisor was not listening to me, I would politely ask him for his opinion. This is a strategy to get his attention without disrespecting their authority.You are already on your way home when your best friend, Diego, approaches you and asks for your help with his graded report tomorrow. You know that you need to go home early because of the surprise birthday party for your father but you also see the concerned look on your best friend. What will you do and what are you going to tell Diego?    First, I would check up on the time to see if I have extra time before the party starts. If I have enough time, I would help Diego with his report. However, if there wasn't enough time before the party, I would ask Diego if I can just help him after the party. If he tells me that he's not available after the party, then I would help him find someone to help him with the project instead. I would've asked him to come over at the party, so that we can do it there, but I would not risk it since it would be disrespectful to my family.​</h2><br />

For me, deciding whether to go out or not is like a death and life situated. But five days before Christmas, I went out with a friend without thinking twice or thrice. Did I regret it? I didn’t. Because even though I wasn’t in my comfort zone, it felt like I was still at home. My friend invited me to go out as planned, and it was supposed to be happening five days after. But since I thought I have to, I agreed to her right away. Two o’clock was the set time, but we left twenty minutes after three in the afternoon. She informed me just thirty minutes before two and I had so much to do. I was ready to go, locked the door, and walked. I opened my umbrella and put my backpack in front of me. From Tanay Park, we planned to go to the town’s dike often called as “Dike ng Tanay”. After how many days, ngayon na lang ako ulit nakalabas,” I said to her as we walked. We were happy though it was sunny and hot. We talked a lot about anything that mostly made us laugh. We even shared insights about our studies. The sun was still there maintaining the warmness and humid of the air, but we managed to arrive without any complaint. When we were just meters away, I asked her to take a photo of me while walking towards the dike. “Continue, stop, continue,” she reminded. Once we got there, we sat on the bench, facing the picturesque and calm view of the lake. We took photos from the dike to the magnificent lighthouse of Tanay, the abundant water lilies on the shore, colorful boats, blue and clear sky and the busy road where people were enjoying the sunset view of Tanay Dike. After spending an hour doing a lot of things, we decided to leave and to go to another place. We were now going to the nearby dike. It took us twice the time and distance. There, we had some complaints of tiredness. Our feet were already aching, and we were really tired walking. Despite quitting, we ignored it and just talked and laughed. As we go nearer the place, we have seen the sun was about to set, and we did not notice the air was becoming cooler as the time passed by. It was getting dark and the streetlights were starting to open. It was a comfortable feeling especially when the people started walking out. Suddenly, I thought of the things that sadden me. The things I wish I could and couldn’t have. Then I remembered how long I have run before. I became motivated, thinking of the idea that I would never get rid of this feeling wherever I go. Someday, I guess, I’d be loving to hang out with friends while travelling the world together. Life won’t run in your comfort zone throughout the years, and I.​</h2><br />

If we'll look to it intently, we can see how three of the choices in each item all means the same with the given word in the question.
