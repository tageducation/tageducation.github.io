In addition, it educates and monitors scientists conducting research to ensure a high ethical standard. The following is a general summary of some ethical principles:</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Honesty:</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Honestly report data, results, methods and procedures, and publication status. Do not fabricate, falsify, or misrepresent data.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Objectivity:</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Strive to avoid bias in experimental design, data analysis, data interpretation, peer review, personnel decisions, grant writing, expert testimony, and other aspects of research.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Integrity:</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Keep your promises and agreements; act with sincerity; strive for consistency of thought and action.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Carefulness:</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Avoid careless errors and negligence; carefully and critically examine your own work and the work of your peers. Keep good records of research activities.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Openness:</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Share data, results, ideas, tools, resources. Be open to criticism and new ideas.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Respect for Intellectual Property:</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Honor patents, copyrights, and other forms of intellectual property.

Quantitative methods allow you to test a hypothesis by systematically collecting and analyzing data, while qualitative methods allow you to explore ideas and experiences in depth.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Research data can be placed into two broad categories: quantitative or qualitative. Quantitative data are used when a researcher is trying to quantify a problem, or address the "what" or "how many" aspects of a research question.

When you have a proper in-depth analysis of any topic, the result comes out to be fruitful and also the knowledge is enhanced.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>So not only is research an invaluable tool for building on crucial knowledge, it's also the most reliable way we can begin to understand the complexities of various issues; to maintain our integrity as we disprove lies and uphold important truths; to serve as the seed for analysing convoluted sets of data; as well as.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Research that develops our critical thinking skills, gives us knowledge and learnings and also provide us an information that we can apply or use in our daily life.
