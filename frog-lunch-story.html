 FROG’S LUNCH
One day, a frog sat on a lily pad, still as a rock. 
A fish swam by. 
“Hello, Mr. Frog! What are you waiting for?” 
“I am waiting for my lunch,” said the frog.
“Oh, good luck!” said the fish and swam away.
Then, a duck waddled by. 
“Hello, Mr. Frog! What are you waiting for?” 
“I am waiting for my lunch,” said the frog. 
“Oh, good luck!” said the duck and waddled away.
Then a bug came buzzing by. 
“Hello, Mr. Frog! What are you doing?” asked the bug.
“I’m having my lunch! Slurp!” said the frog.
 Mr. Frog smiled.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>plot of the story:</strong> Hardworking and ambitious, Tiana (Anika Noni Rose) dreams of one day opening the finest restaurant in New Orleans. Her dream takes a slight detour when she meets Prince Naveen (Bruno Campos), who has been turned into an amphibian by evil Dr. Facilier. Mistaking her for a princess and hoping to break the spell, Naveen plants a kiss on poor Tiana -- thereby turning her into a frog as well. The pair hop along on an adventure through the bayous to seek the help of a powerful voodoo priestess.
</p><p><strong>exposition of the story:</strong> The Princess and the Frog finds the lives of arrogant, carefree Prince Naveen and hardworking waitress Tiana crossing paths. Prince Naveen is transformed into a frog by a conniving voodoo magician and Tiana, following suit, upon kissing the amphibian royalty.
</p><p><strong>moral of the story: </strong>One of the themes of The Frog Prince is about keeping your promises. The princess tries to back out of her promise to the frog, but her father insists that she maintain her integrity. As a result, the princess ends up with her prince. Another theme is about persistence.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Once upon a time there was a Princess.

She took the ball to the palace yard and threw it higher and higher. One time she threw it extra high and when she ran to catch the ball, she tripped on a tree stump. The ball fell and plopped right down into the royal well!  She raced over to fetch her ball before it dropped too far, but by the time she got there she could no longer see it in the water.</p><p>Answer:</p><p>Once upon a time there was a Princess.

He dived deep into the well. A few moments later, up he came with the ball held high in one hand.</p><p></p><p>“Thank you,” said the Princess, taking it from him.  </p><p></p><p>The Princess and the Frog Story</p><p></p><p></p><p>She turned to go.</p><p></p><p>“Wait a minute!” said the Frog.  “You promised to spend time with me today!”</p><p></p><p>“I already did,” she said with a shrug.  And the Princess walked back to the palace.</p><p></p><p></p><p>That night at dinner with her family and the royal advisers, there was a knock on the door.  The servant opened the door and saw no one there. The Frog, standing down low, cleared his throat. “The Princess promised to spend time with me today,” said the Frog in as loud a voice as he could.  “So here I am.”</p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p>That night at dinner with her family and the royal advisers, there was a knock on the door.</p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p>“Daughter!” said the King from the far end of the table.  “Did you promise to spend time with this Frog, as he claims?”</p><p></p><p>“Sort of,” said the Princess.  After a pause, she added, “Oh very well, come on in.”</p><p></p><p>The servants quickly set a new place setting for the Frog, and he hopped over to the royal dining table.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Princess and the Frog</p><p></p><p>Conversation turned to a topic of concern in the kingdom.  None of the royal advisers knew what to do.</p><p></p><p>“Father, if I may,” said the Princess.  “Perhaps we could–“</p><p></p><p>“Stop!” said the King, cutting her off.  “I have enough advisors, believe me.”</p><p></p><p>“If I may,” said the Frog, and it was the first time he had spoken at the table.  “There’s more to a princess than her fine crown and royal dresses.”</p><p></p><p>The Princess stared at the Frog. How could this little frog – more than anyone else – understand such a thing?</p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p>“If I may,” said the Frog, and it was the first time he has spoken at the table.</p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p>After dinner, the Frog bowed to the Princess.  He said, “You have done what you said you would do.  I suppose it’s time now for me to go.”</p><p></p><p>“No wait!” said the Princess, “it’s not that late.  How about a walk in the garden?”</p><p></p><p>The Frog was delighted.  The two of them walked in the royal garden, the Frog hopping along the stone wall so he and the Princess were at the same level and could talk easily.</p><p></p><p> </p><p> They laughed about many things. Later, when the sun set, they admired the deep rosy reds it cast in the sky.</p><p></p><p>The Princess said, “You know, being with you tonight was a lot more fun than I thought.”</p><p></p><p></p><p>“I had a very good time, too,” said the Frog.</p><p></p><p>“Who knew?” said the Princess with a laugh. She leaned over and kissed the Frog lightly on his cheek.</p><p></p><p>The Princess and the Frog</p><p></p><p>At once, there was a puff of clouds and smoke.  The small green frog had changed into a young prince!  The Princess jumped back in surprise, and who could blame her?  The Prince quickly told her not to worry, that all was well. Years before, an evil witch had put a spell on him that he must stay a frog until he was kissed by a princess.  The witch had laughed an evil laugh, saying, “Like THAT will ever happen!” But it did!</p><p></p><p>Now the Prince and Princess could get to know each other better.  Years later, after they were married, they had a beautiful setting made for the ball and placed it on their royal dining table.  And when the sunlight shone in through the palace windows, the ball sparkled for all to see.</p><p></p><p>Explanation:</p><p>The end</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>A young Mouse in search of adventure was running along the bank of a pond where lived a Frog. When the Frog saw the Mouse, he swam to the bank and croaked:</p><p></p><p>"Won't you pay me a visit? I can promise you a good time if you do."</p><p></p><p>The Mouse did not need much coaxing, for he was very anxious to see the world and everything in it. But though he could swim a little, he did not dare risk going into the pond without some help.</p><p></p><p>The Frog had a plan. He tied the Mouse's leg to his own with a tough reed. Then into the pond he jumped, dragging his foolish companion with him. The Mouse soon had enough of it and wanted to return to shore; but the treacherous Frog had other plans. He pulled the Mouse down under the water and drowned him. But before he could untie the reed that bound him to the dead Mouse, a Hawk came sailing over the pond. Seeing the body of the Mouse floating on the water, the Hawk swooped down, seized the Mouse and carried it off, with the Frog dangling from its leg. Thus at one swoop he had caught both meat and fish for his dinner.</p><br />

                            28. the story of the tiny frog​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Once upon a time, there was a group of tiny frogs who arranged a competition. The goal was to reach the top of a tower. A huge crowd of frogs gathered to watch the race.</p><p></p><p>The race began.</p><p></p><p>Not one frog in the audience believed that the contestants would reach to the top. After all, it was a HUGE tower! The crowd grew and many yelled,</p><p></p><p>“This is too difficult!’</p><p>“They will NEVER make it to the top.”</p><p>“Not a chance that they will succeed. The tower is too high!”</p><p>One by one, the tiny frogs collapsed and fell off the tower. Still, there was a group of determined frogs that climbed higher and higher. But the crowd continued to yell,</p><p></p><p>“This is too difficult! No one will make it!”</p><p>Discouraged and convinced by the negative cries, more of these tiny frogs collapsed and fell off the tower. Many frogs who were still climbing complained of the pain and eventually gave up. Some frogs, tired and battered, heard their peers’ complaints and subsequently threw in the towel too.</p><p></p><p>In the midst of this, one tiny frog persisted. He climbed, and he climbed. This tiny frog seemed to have super-frog strength that allowed him to push forward in spite of others failing. Why, though? Why is he able to climb so far when others are failing? the crowd wondered.</p><p></p><p>By now, all the tiny frogs had either collapsed or given up — except for that one tiny frog. The crowd continued to yell, now at the tiny frog:</p><p></p><p>“This is too difficult!’</p><p>“You will NEVER make it to the top!”</p><p>“Not a chance that you will succeed. The tower is too high!”</p><p>But for some reason, that tiny frog climbed further, seemingly unaffected. Finally, he reached the top of the hill. He had reached his destination!</p><p></p><p>All the tiny frogs were amazed as to how this one frog was able to make it to the top. They crowded around him, wanting to know his secret.</p><p></p><p>As it turned out, he was deaf.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Naturally, everyone wanted to know how this one tiny frog managed to pull it off when every other contestant gave up. They wanted to know how this tiny frog had found the strength to reach this goal that everyone else thought it was impossible. So, they asked questions. It turned out that the winner was deaf!!</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>The bird said to the frog, “come up to the outside world where it is bright and warm.” Upon hearing this, the frog laughed at the bird, thinking that the well was in fact the entire world. The moral of this story warns against discounting things that lay outside one's own experience.</strong></p><p><strong>Have a great day/week.</strong></p><strong>999</strong><br />
