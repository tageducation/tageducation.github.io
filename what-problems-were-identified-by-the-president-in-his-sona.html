Regarding the COVID-19 virus, it is recommended that people remain indoors, get vaccines, and adhere to the necessary protocols; however, the prescription problem is difficult to handle as a result of the government's occupancy of its own territory. The dread and confusion brought on by the coronavirus are also to the benefit of those who are corrupt, those who engage in graft, and those who trade in influence. In addition, the <strong>government's financial</strong> and material support, which totals billions of pesos, for the unemployed, the suffering, and the homeless are not immune to corruption and inefficiency. Even private donations made with the best of intentions are subject to fraud and waste before they reach the people for whom they were intended.
