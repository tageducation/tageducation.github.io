Refer to the given illustration. How does sunlight affect the growth of a plant? In most plants, photosynthesis takes place mainly in the leaves. For photosynthesis to work, the chloroplast needs a source of energy like sunlight and ingredients such as carbon dioxide and water. When light energy, carbon dioxide, and water are present, a chemical reaction takes place. Two different set-ups were prepared, Plant A and Plant B. Plant A was placed inside the box, hence, there is no air and sunlight. Plant B was placed outside the house with enough sunlight. After a week, the effect of sunlight on the growth and development of the plants was observed. Plant A, which is placed inside the box withered and died. While plant B with enough sunlight grew healthy. Therefore, it only proves that sunlight and a gas in the air has a great effect on the growth of a plant. Without sunlight and a gas from the air, plants can’t live nor grow to the fullest. Flow Chart Given Illustration Write your answer on the Flow Chart here.

ACTIVITY No. 1-B Direction: Read the paragraphs below and complete the flow chart with the statement or statements that correspond to the steps of scientific investigation. Refer to the given illustration. How does sunlight affect the growth of a plant? In most plants, photosynthesis takes place mainly in the leaves. For photosynthesis to work, the chloroplast needs a source of energy like sunlight and ingredients such as carbon dioxide and water. When light energy, carbon dioxide, and water are present, a chemical reaction takes place. Two different set-ups were prepared, Plant A and Plant B. Plant A was placed inside the box, hence, there is no air and sunlight. Plant B was placed outside the house with enough sunlight. After a week, the effect of sunlight on the growth and development of the plants was observed. Plant A, which is placed inside the box withered and died. While plant B with enough sunlight grew healthy. Therefore, it only proves that sunlight and a gas in the air has a great effect on the growth of a plant. Without sunlight and a gas from the air, plants can’t live nor grow to the fullest. Flow Chart Given Illustration Write your answer on the Flow Chart here.

The question should be <strong>specific</strong> and <strong>can be answered through an experiment</strong>. After identifying the problem, one should <strong>gather pertinent data about the problem in order to come up with a tentative answer to the question</strong>. This tentative answer is known as the <strong>hypothesis</strong>. To prove or disprove the hypothesis, one has to <strong>conduct an experiment</strong>. The experiment will allow us to see the relationship between the independent and dependent variables. In the situation given, we are trying to see the effect of sunlight on the growth of the plant. <strong>Results of the experiment are then gathered and analyzed.</strong> The analysis of results will either accept or reject the hypothesis. After the analysis of data, a conclusion is made. The <strong>conclusion</strong> is the answer to the question or problem. Also, the conclusion may lead us to more questions and problems, and the cycle repeats. </p><p></p><p>#BRAINLYFAST</p><p></p><br />
