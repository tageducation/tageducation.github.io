                            1. reliable and unreliable sources of health information and products</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Reliable and unreliable sources of health information and products

<p>It is generally accepted that if an individual needs to get more <strong>reliable sources of health information, </strong>he or she would have to approach somebody who is involved in<strong> modern western medicine</strong> and stay away from<strong> faith healers</strong> which are considered as the <strong>unreliable alternative. </strong>
</p><p>
</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong>Reliable sources:
</strong></p>Doctors health workers and nurses reputable internet sites  <p>
</p><p>Doctors are professionals that are approved by the government to treat the population. There are experts in different areas of the human body and as long as a health problem is caught early, they can generally fix it.
</p><p>Health workers and nurses in public clinics are a great help because even though they aren’t doctors, they've usually spent a lot of time with one, well, enough to help you out with minor health problems. If research doesn’t bore you, you'll find plenty of reliable internet sites that may give you some hints about certain diseases.  </p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>They will provide you with information about the following:</strong></p> the name of the disease symptoms level of risk  when to see the doctor.  
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Unreliable sources:
</strong></p>Faith healers witch doctors blogs unreputable internet sites  <p>
</p><p><strong>Faith healers</strong> <strong>and witch doctors</strong> are trusted by many of those in rural areas, it is part of the culture.  Some patients even believe in healers even more than doctors because of many testimonials from relatives and other people. They are able to help using plants from around the area, but only on minor problems. It becomes dangerous when a few claims to heal cancer with oil and boiled leaves.  </p><p>Today anybody with a computer can write a <strong>blog </strong>and create a <strong>site</strong>, this is fine when it is about recipes, traveling, hobbies and other leisurely pursuits. It is another matter when somebody who thinks he or she knows with certainty, the cure and prescribes it on an <strong>internet site.</strong> There is a high percentage that many will listen and follow, considering today’s price of going to the doctor. This may become a later problem for the reader whether he or she is the patient or not.  </p><p>
</p><p><strong>The present cost of medical treatment will cause many people to seek help from less reliable sources. </strong>When the price of the cure can bankrupt the entire family, it becomes a difficult balancing act for anyone. <strong>The government should provide quality socialized medical treatment for every citizen.

                            3. sources of health information and products reliable and unreliable</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Health information is readily available from reputable sources such as:</p><p>health brochures in your local hospital, doctor’s office or community health centre</p><p>telephone helplines such as NURSE-ON-CALL or Directline</p><p>your doctor or pharmacist</p><p>reliable health information websites, such as government sites, condition-specific sites, support organisation sites, and medical journals.</p><p>Other information may not be as reliable as that from healthcare professionals. It is best to assess other sources of medical information with an open mind as they may be inaccurate. These include magazine or TV stories or ads, advice from family and friends, or websites that may be promoting a product.</p><p></p><p>Some healthcare products or treatments may say they are ‘scientifically tested’ but this does not mean they are ‘scientifically proven’. If they do talk about health research, they should provide a link to the research information. Even then, the study may not be reputable. Only your healthcare professionals, such as your local doctor, can provide the most appropriate health advice.</p><p>Researching reliable health information online</p><p>Anyone can create a website, so there is no ‘gatekeeper’ to make sure that online health information is reliable. Working out which information is trustworthy is not always easy. As access to health research and evidence increases, so do the risks of misinterpreting it, and the chances of any one person getting a complete and balanced picture decreases.</p><p></p><p>When it comes to health and medical information, there are plenty of reliable sources available online through government-endorsed health websites (such as Better Health Channel), peak industry bodies (such as the Australian Medical Association) and peak condition-specific organisations (such as beyondblue and Cancer Council Victoria).</p><p></p><p>When searching for health information from less well-known online sources consider:</p><p>The source of the information – understand who is providing or endorsing the content. The ‘About us’ page will tell you who runs the site – it may be a legitimate health organisation or an individual (such as someone who has had experience with the illness and wants to share what they have learned).</p><p>Quality control measures – does the site have an editorial board? Is the information reviewed by qualified experts before it is posted? This information should be available on the ‘About us’ page or something similar.</p><p>A level of scepticism about online health products – if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Does it promise quick and easy results? Words like ‘secret ingredient’ should raise suspicions. If the provider is serious, they will be open about their products. Check if their claims are endorsed on more than one website.</p><p>What is the evidence? – look for reputable medical research to back up claims. Do not trust testimonials from people you do not know – they may have been paid for their endorsement (or given free products or services).</p><p>Is the information up to date? – check the date the information was posted or when the site was last updated (this is usually available at the bottom of the screen).</p><p>Beware of bias – who is funding the website? What is its purpose? If the site is funded by a company that only recommends its own products, take this into consideration. Check if it has a particular philosophical bias that influences its advice.</p><p>Is your privacy protected? – health information should be confidential. Beware of websites that ask for private information or share your details with others without your permission. Most reputable sites publish their privacy policy on the site.</p><br />

                        <p>Introduction
</p><p>Many sources of data and information are used to measure the health of the Caribbean population and provide health surveillance. In Lessons 1 and 2, you explored measures of health status, definitions of and formulae for morbidity, mortality and natality, and explored some the health indicators. 
</p><p>
</p><p>As you have seen, there is a wide range of information available to the public health practitioner. It is sometimes difficult to locate the most appropriate information and standardization of data collection methods and compatibility of information from one jurisdiction to another can be a challenge. These are not insurmountable problems; high quality data sets (with proper attention to confidentiality and privacy) are available for public health use, and several initiatives are underway to work on common definitions, standard data collection instruments and standard procedures. 
</p><p>
</p><p>In this lesson, we will explore: 
</p><p>
</p><p>sources of information available to define the health of a population
</p><p>strategies for selecting appropriate sources for selected indicators of health status 
</p><p>Throughout this lesson, you will be prompted to reflect on the concepts and principles as they pertain to your work as a public health practitioner. You will be invited to think of examples from your work, that of your colleagues and the material you read.
</p><p>
</p><p>The assignment in this lesson will build on your notes and examples.

It is another matter when somebody who thinks he or she knows with certainty, the cure and prescribes it on an internet site.

                        1. The health-related information should tell you the information’s source so as you would be able to double check it. Unreliable sources could be an idea of anyone without any testings done, researched made and even statistic to back them up.<br />2. Health information is constantly changing and researchers continue to learn new things about various diseases and their treatments. Unreliable resources would not be up-to-date.<br />3. Check out who is responsible for creating the website. If the home page doesn’t tell you who publishes the site, look for a link that says “About us” or “About this site.” Check the reputation of the website whether they are created by an organization or an individual.<br /><br />

Examples of reliable and unreliable sources of health information and products
<p>
</p>Different <strong>health information sources  and products</strong> are available.  Others are <strong>trustworthy</strong>  and others <strong>untrustworthy</strong>.  It is up for us, especially when dealing with health  information, to ensure that we get the information from credible sources.  There are many ways to assess  whether a piece of information is accurate.  Talk all about  this. Talk all.
<p>
</p><strong>Sources of Reliable Materials</strong>: People
For instance, do not seek a doctor,  but a nutritionist, when seeking advice on nutrition.  The same applies to  other information on health.  Doctors know nothing about diet or other related medical knowledge, although they are  experts in cure for diseases, as they probably only took 2 subjects during college.  Check for  renowned research experts
<p>
</p><p>
</p>Sources of Reliable Material: Printed Information
Brochures, journal articles and newspaper  articles typically have accurate information.  Check for articles checked by  peers while reading printed documents.  In other words, a panel of experts  examined and examined the precise and methodological documents.  Please pay close attention to  brochures advertising a particular health product.  They are typically biased towards their own goods  and may cite weak methods from faulty studies.
