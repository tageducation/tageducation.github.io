Was the music used appropriately?4. If you were one of the original composers, would you allow your compositions tobe used as they are used today? Why or Why not?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>1. Yes of course, as some music way back was also heard these days. It's undeniable that music is always evolving, and so are the trends</strong>. Currently, there are at least a few types of music trends that have entered the music industry and are "sold", which is very different from the music of the past. Nowadays, music is mostly dominated by pop trends, rap, etc. In the 20th century, the art of music underwent a revolution in the form and style of what is now known as modern music. Modern music always develops and there is renewal as the times' progress, modern music is universal and comprehensive so that everyone can understand, understand, and enjoy modern music.</p><p>The development of modern music occurred in the 1940s-1960s, in addition to experimental music genres, and so on, the presence of technology at that time also had a strong influence on the development of new music.</p><p></p><p><strong>2. It's more like a fascinating lullaby for me.</strong> <strong>Background music is music that serves as background/accompanies the program material being broadcast</strong>. Given its function as a background, then in choosing/using this music, it must be completely following the material being presented. The use of this music will at least liven up and color the atmosphere.</p><p></p><p><strong>3. Definitely yes, as music centuries ago was made and sung gently, I mean those songs that were featured before were amazing plus the lyrics of it. Compared to modern music, old music is way ahead. It doesn't matter what you like to listen to, but the fact remains that music has been going downhill since the 90s. It's easy to spot in the lyrical complexity of modern music. Almost all songs have lyrics with the same meaning. </strong>Many of them sound the same. If you look at a particular song, you'll see that it doesn't change much, and it uses the same words over and over again. I know it's not fair, but let's look at led zeppelin. They sing about cults, Vikings, love, and references to Middle-earth and Greek mythology.</p><p><strong>4. Of course, for other people to feel and recognize that some music that was made way back was so worth it to be heard by some. A composer is someone who creates and writes music.</strong> With various forms. Starting from vocals in the form of singers and choirs, making instrumentals, and electronics, to a combination of various forms of music. There are many kinds of music genres that can be created by a composer. Such as jazz, classical, blouse, and even pop genres that are loved by young people today. A composer releases his ideas in the form of musical scores written in music notation.</p><p></p><p>References: </p><p>brainly.ph/question/4006732</p><p>brainly.ph/question/3260743</p><p></p><p>#SPJ2</p><br />

                        Background music refers to various styles of music or soundscapes primarily intended to be passively listened to. It is not meant to be the main focus of an audience, but rather to supplement that which is meant to be focused upon. Music that is played at a low volume and is not the main focus of an audience is also referred to as background music. Traditional examples of background music include music played at various social gatherings and music played in certain retail venues. It is also common to employ background music in various electronic media including film, television, video games, and Internet videos such as video blogs.<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Chapter Summary: The goal of this chapter is to introduce the reader to the most well-known music teaching methods used in music education. They are Zoltan Kodály, Emile-Jacques Dalcroze, Orff Schulwerk, Edwin Gordon, Shinseki Suzuki, and Reggio Emilia. This chapter also familiarizes the reader with each method’s philosophy and principles, unique pedagogy, and practices and activities.</p><p></p><p>The material introduced in this chapter will be referenced and built upon throughout the remainder of the book.</p><p></p><p>Music Methods for Working With Children</p><p>What Is a Method?</p><p>A music education, or any other type of education method, is a teaching approach that has: 1) an identifiable underlying philosophy or set of principles; 2) a unified body of pedagogy unique to it with a body of well-defined practice; 3) goals and objectives worthy of pursuit; and 4) integrity (i.e., its reason for existence must not be commercial) (Chosky et al.).</p><p></p><p>Although these approaches are often taught in music education classes, they are highly applicable, accessible, and integrated methods appropriate for anyone interested in working with children and the arts, or music in education in addition to music education. All educators can incorporate the basic techniques used in these methods as they offer creative, arts-driven curricula through which to teach.</p><p></p><p>Method Similarities</p><p>The music methods of Jaques-Emile Dalcroze, Zoltan Kodály, Carl Orff, and S. Suzuki are time-tested and contain well-practiced and researched techniques for teaching music. All of these approaches to music learning contain fundamental similarities in that they:</p><p></p><p>Are systematic and sequential in design;</p><p>Utilize music with authenticity and integrity, such as folk music;</p><p>Are based on incorporating the “mother-tongue” approach to rhythm, pitch, and timbre from the child’s persepctive, innate behaviors and how interaction with their natural environment; and</p><p>Encourage active engagement with the student.</p><p>They are also “comprehensive and holistic [in preparing] children to be artists, creators, and producers and not just consumers of music.They pair active and actual music-making with conceptual learning experiences offered in a systematic approach” (Moore).</p><p></p><p>The holistic nature of these highly integrated approaches, is still conducive today for implementation in an integrated arts program. This is due to the fact that their core identities, particularly Orff and Dalcroze, contain elements of drama, movement, sound, and music.</p><br />
