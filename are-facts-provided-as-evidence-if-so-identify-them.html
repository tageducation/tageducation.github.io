                        The answer is yes provided that an evidence is scientifically accepted, tested and complied within the acceptable guidelines or methods.  But at times, even fallacies are provided as evidence too. :)<br /><br />For instance, it is believed that living cells came from non-living cells.  This is just a theory, not a fact. It is because there is no proven evidence linking non-living things to living cells.  Evolution teaches this though.  But they failed to provide proof of evidence to support this claim.  Eventhough, they insists on this claim as factual and thus provided as evidence.  So wrong.<br /><br /><br /><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.) Obama addressed the subjects of racial tensions, white privilege, and race and inequality in the United States, discussing black "anger", white "resentment", and other issues as he sought to explain and contextualize Wright's controversial comments.</p><p></p><p>2.) As the former president Barack Obama said, "Let's be clear, There are no winners here" as he signed the stop-gap bill. He explained fully the enumerated implementations and its advantages and future benefits. ... But still, some people don't put their trust on Barack Obama's words.</p><p></p><p>3.) A thesis statement clearly identifies the topic being discussed, includes the points discussed in the paper, and is written for a specific ...Always stated in your introduction.</p><p></p><p>4.)He said that the fact is, democracy has never been easy and our Founding Fathers argued about everything. We waged a Civil War. We overcame depression. We’ve lurched from eras of great progressive change to periods of retrenchment.</p><p></p><p>5.) The statement of obama is sound and logical.</p><p></p><p>6.) the readers' emotions; name calling is an invalid argument that deviates from a certain topic and attacks the person; and, appeal to authority uses authoritative support to win an argument.</p><p></p><p>7.) For me yup. because I understand Obama’s speech he wants all people to be equal for everyone no matter what kind of color everyone has. And regardless of the status of different people, for Obama everyone has equal rights</p><p></p><p>8.) Yes, there is an issue similar in the Philippines the issue is that,The Poverty and Inequality in the Philippines remains a challenge until now.The discrimination is always have even in the Philippines. </p><p></p><p>9.)  Wall Street Crash and Great Depression of the 1930's in America.This situation is still facing until current administration. President Obama’s Wall Street reform law created an independent agency to set and enforce clear, consistent rules for the financial marketplace. </p><br />

in This’ Government Shutdownhelp pls... :[[​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.]There’s been a lot of discussion lately of the politics of this shutdown. But the truth is, there were no winners in this. At a time when our economy needs more growth and more jobs, the manufactured crises of these last few weeks actually harmed jobs and growth.</p><p>2.]There is no choice between growth and fiscal responsibility – we need both. So we’re making a serious mistake if a budget doesn’t focus on what you’re focused on: creating more good jobs that pay better wages. If we’re going to free up resources for the things that help us grow – education, infrastructure, research – we should cut what we don’t need, and close corporate tax loopholes that don’t help create jobs.
</p><p>This shouldn’t be as difficult as it has been in past years. Remember, our deficits are shrinking – not growing. Second, we should finish the job of fixing our broken immigration system. There’s already a broad coalition across America that’s behind this effort, from business leaders to faith leaders to law enforcement. It would grow our economy. It would secure our borders. The Senate has already passed a bill with strong bipartisan support. Now the House should, too. The majority of Americans thinks this is the right thing to do. It can and should get done by the end of this year. Third, we should pass a farm bill – one that America’s farmers and ranchers can depend on, one that protects vulnerable children and adults in times of need, and one that gives rural communities opportunities to grow and the longer-term certainty they deserve. We won’t suddenly agree on everything now that the cloud of crisis has passed. But we shouldn’t hold back on places where we do agree, just because we don’t think it’s good politics, or just because the extremes in our parties don’t like compromise. I’ll look for willing partners from either party to get important work done. There’s no good reason why we can’t govern responsibly, without lurching from manufactured crisis to manufactured crisis. Because that isn’t governing – it’s just hurting the people we were sent here to serve. Those of us who have the privilege to serve this country have an obligation to do our job the best we can. We come from different parties, but we’re Americans first. And our obligations to you must compel all of us, Democrats and Republicans, to cooperate, and compromise, and act in the best interests of this country we love</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />
