Girl scouts support cleanliness drive Reesay Mae Decain SJPES Girl Scouts are on the lead. To maintain the cleanliness around San Jose Pilot Elementary School, girl scouts from the intermediate levels have performed their duties by conducting civic works every Friday. The girls, wearing their GSP uniforms, walk around the school to pick pieces of papers, candy wrappers and other kinds of garbage. They also clean areas where mosquitoes thrive by pulling shrubs and grasses. Carrying their empty sacks, they show to other pupils the importance doing a good turn daily. Girl scouts work with Science Club and YEŞ-O members as Little Environmentalists' to get names of pupils who were caught littering in school surroundings. They give disciplinary actions to 'policy-breakers' in simple community service like cleaning school ground or sending them to the guidance office.​</a>

Girl scouts support cleanliness drive Reesay Mae Decain SJPES Girl Scouts are on the lead. To maintain the cleanliness around San Jose Pilot Elementary School, girl scouts from the intermediate levels have performed their duties by conducting civic works every Friday. The girls, wearing their GSP uniforms, walk around the school to pick pieces of papers, candy wrappers and other kinds of garbage. They also clean areas where mosquitoes thrive by pulling shrubs and grasses. Carrying their empty sacks, they show to other pupils the importance doing a good turn daily. Girl scouts work with Science Club and YEŞ-O members as Little Environmentalists' to get names of pupils who were caught littering in school surroundings. They give disciplinary actions to 'policy-breakers' in simple community service like cleaning school ground or sending them to the guidance office.​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Market</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Qualitative research in marketing can be used to test new ideas or products and to gain a realistic view of how customers or clients would react to that particular product. It can also be used to discover perceptions or attitudes which otherwise cannot be captured through quantitative research, for example, gauging the behavioral reaction, body language or voice intonation of a customer or client when they are viewing an advertisement or product packaging. Qualitative research can also be used as a board for new and fresh ideas, which may for example help a company in a branding strategy. Furthermore, qualitative research can be used as a tool to complement quantitative research, either prior to conducting quantitative research, for example, to narrow down or screen ideas or concepts which can be potentially tested. Or else after conducting quantitative research, for example after finding out the most popular products one might consider holding a focus group to test the best to advertise these particular products.
