Text 3. The Acer barbatum is a small to medium-sized, deciduous tree usually ranging from 15 to 25 m. (50 to 80 ft.) tall when mature. Its bark is light gray and smooth on younger trees, and it becomes ridged and furrowed with age. Leaves are opposite and shallowly to deeply palmately lobed, with a few blunt teeth but no serrations. The leaf sinuses are rounded, unlike those of red maple (Acer rubrum) which are sharply V-shaped. Also, the sides of terminal leaf lobes are more or less parallel, while those of red maple are widest at the base, tapering to the tip.

Text 3. The Acer barbatum is a small to medium-sized, deciduous tree usually ranging from 15 to 25 m. (50 to 80 ft.) tall when mature. Its bark is light gray and smooth on younger trees, and it becomes ridged and furrowed with age. Leaves are opposite and shallowly to deeply palmately lobed, with a few blunt teeth but no serrations. The leaf sinuses are rounded, unlike those of red maple (Acer rubrum) which are sharply V-shaped. Also, the sides of terminal leaf lobes are more or less parallel, while those of red maple are widest at the base, tapering to the tip.

                        The writer knows much of the subject just as how much they write about it. They could also say that our English is bad when you're not able to pronounce or write words correctly and naturally especially when you're like conversing with someone or when writing like you're conversing with the readers.<br /><br /> -hope this helps☺<br />
