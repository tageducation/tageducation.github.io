</p><p>plenty of energy to work and enjoy themselves  </p><p>fewer infections and other illnesses</p><p>A food is something that provides nutrients. Nutrients are substances that provide:
</p><p>
</p><p>energy for activity, growth, and all functions of the body such as breathing, digesting food, and keeping warm;
</p><p>
</p><p>materials for the growth and repair of the body, and for keeping the immune system healthy.
</p><p>
</p><p>There are many different nutrients.We divide them into:
</p><p>
</p><p>Macro (big) nutrients that we need in large amounts. These are:
</p><p>
</p><p>carbohydrates (starches, sugars and dietary fibre);
</p><p>
</p><p>fats - there are several kinds (see Box 4);
</p><p>
</p><p>proteins - there are hundreds of different proteins.
</p><p>
</p><p>Micro (small) nutrients that we need in small amounts. There are many of these but the ones most likely to be lacking in the diet are:
</p><p>
</p><p>minerals - iron (see Box 6, page 19), iodine and zinc;
</p><p>
</p><p>vitamins - vitamin A, B-group vitamins (including folate) and vitamin C.</p><br />
