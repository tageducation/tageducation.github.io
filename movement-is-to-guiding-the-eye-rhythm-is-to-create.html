It can be rough or smooth, soft or hard. 3 .It  ismark with greater length than width. Lines can be horizontal, vertical, or diagonal; straight or curved; thick or thin. 4. It is a closed line. It can be geometric, like squares and circles, or organic, like free-form or natural shapes. Shapes are flat and can express length and width. _5. These are three-dimensional shapes expressing length, width, and depth. Balls, cylinders, boxes, and pyramids are forms. 6. It is the area between and around objects. It can also refer to the feeling of depth. Real space is three-dimensional; in visual art, when we create the feeling or illusion of depth, we call it space. 7.

It is the feeling of harmony between all parts of the work of art, which creates a sense C completeness11. It is the distribution of the visual weight of objects, colors, texture, and space. If the design was a scale, these elements should be balanced to make a design feel stable. 12. It is the part of the design that catches the viewer's attention. Usually the artist will one area stand out by contrasting it with other areas. The area could be different in size, color, texture, etc. 13.

UNITY </strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>EXPLANATION:</strong></p><p>The term rhythm is a basic term in the world of music, as well as <strong>melody</strong>, <strong>harmony</strong>, and so on. Rhythm is a sound that can describe the short length of a series of tones. Rhythm exists because of changes in the short length or the high and low of a regular sound. Patterns in rhythm have a set time.</p><p></p><p>Rhythm is a very important musical <strong>element</strong> of a composition or song. With the rhythm, it will form the composition of a song. Quoting a book entitled Preservation of Minangkabau Traditional Music by Ediwar et al., rhythm can be described by recording note values and describing functions, patterns, and formulas repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>Rhythm deals with <strong>beat seconds</strong> and <strong>regular</strong> <strong>patterns</strong>, which means that rhythm is a mix of note values. However, the word rhythm can also be replaced by beats or accents, which are related to speed. In practice, people use more time signatures than rhythms. A time signature is a notation consisting of two digits, one digit above the other.</p><p></p><p>Rhythm will lead to a patterned <strong>beat</strong>. When you give a beat, there will be repeated accents in a regular pattern. That way, the rhythmic pattern will be in every accent.</p><p></p><p>Learn more about <strong>characteristics of rhythm:</strong></p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/14958932</p><p></p><p>#SPJ2</p><br />
