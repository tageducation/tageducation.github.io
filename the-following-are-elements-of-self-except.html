Emotion is also a reaction to a person or event. Emotions can be shown when feeling happy about something, angry at someone, or afraid of something.</p><p><strong>Emotions develop</strong> over time to help people solve problems. Emotions are useful because they 'motivate' people to engage in actions important to survival – actions such as gathering food, seeking shelter, choosing a mate, guarding against predators, and predicting behavior. Emotions are very influential on the behavior of other human beings.</p><p><strong>While curiosity is </strong>the desire to investigate and seek understanding of the secrets of nature.
