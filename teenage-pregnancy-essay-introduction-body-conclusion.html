                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>As time goes on, teen pregnancy is becoming more and more common throughout the world. So many people frown upon this whole idea. Such people act as if the teenage parents’ world is going to come to an end. Although these kids’ life is going to be making a big turn, there are many of them who are mature enough to take on the responsibilities of a baby. As the medical field advances, the ways to avoid teen pregnancy goes up as well. There are ways such as abortion, plan B pills, and birth control. Some people use this because they know they are not ready to become parents, which I feel is a good and responsible choice. On the other hand, those who use these methods as a way to technically “kill” the unborn is what should be frowned upon instead</p><p></p><p></p><br />

Delaying one year from your batch because you have to wait 9 months for your baby to come out from your womb. There are also a lot of teenage pregnant woman who died due lack of proper medical attention. Babies also has a greater risk being premature, most likely due to socioeconomic system of the mother. It is also difficult for a single teenage mom to sustain her baby’s needs because she do not have a proper education qualification to have a good job and salary. The numbers of teenage pregnancy is becoming high, and before it will get worst than now, weneed to cut it off. It should always start in the parents. Parents should educate their child, but in order for these to work, parents should put a strong relationship towards their child. So that the parents can have more influence in their child sex decision. Teenagers should also be aware of what teenage pregnancy can bring and how will it change their life. Instead of thinking those kind of things, why not live your teenage years happily and for you to achieve something that you wanted to become. </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>hope it helps</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>CONCLUSION:</p><p>Teen pregnancy is a crisis that concerns the baby, parents, other members of the family, as well as resources of the community. Every year, approximately 750,000 women aged 15 to 19 become pregnant every year.</p><p></p><p>Nevertheless, despite the numerous elements that can influence teen pregnancy, for many teenagers, the lack of safe sex education from schools, parents, or otherwise is the root cause of teenage pregnancy. Generally, teenagers are not taught regarding the means of birth control and how to respond with friends who compel them into having sexual intercourse before they are prepared.</p><p></p><p>Teen pregnancies carry additional risk equally to the health of the infant and the mother. On the average, teen pregnancies are more expected to result in low-birth-weight babies and premature births. This is because pregnant teenagers often do not obtain the timely prenatal care required. In addition, the aforesaid teenagers have a higher risk of high blood pressures associated to their pregnancy and other related complications. Further, teenage mothers are less expected than other women to complete or attend college, and divorce is more expected to result from their early marriage. Abortion is another effect of teenage pregnancy.</p><p></p><p>Given with these numerous effects of teenage pregnancy, I think that the society here in the Philippines still does not accept this issue. Especially the Church. Having premarital Sex is wrong in any aspect, it is forbidden. Since the Philippines is considered as a Christian Country. </p><br />

                        TEENAGE PREGNANCY ESSAY (786 words)<br /><br />Pregnancy in girls aged 19 or below is termed as teenage pregnancy. There are many social, emotional and health problems associated with teenage pregnancy. Even though increased awareness about sexual health and greater used of condoms has brought down the cases of teenage pregnancy in countries like U.S., the responsible factors like low education standards, poverty, inappropriate knowledge of sex amongst adolescents contributes to cases of teenage pregnancy.<br /><br />Some developing nations are faced with problems of early marriage and non-awareness about contraceptives which also contributes to cases of teenage pregnancy.<br /><br />ADVERTISEMENTS:<br /><br />Since unplanned sexual intercourse is more common in age group 12-14 who are not aware of protected sex, the concern becomes grave for younger girls who get pregnant. If an adolescent girl gets pregnant in such an early age, abortion is one option to be considered if the pregnancy is tested and detected in time.<br /><br />In cases where girl is in later adolescence, adoption or support of community to raise the child are some ways to help the teen pregnant emotionally and also if she is financially incapable of nurturing a child. It is highly important to seek support from parents of the girl or the father of the expected child so that appropriate prenatal care can be offered. It is essential that teenage mothers stay away from smoking, drug abuse and so on.<br /><br />Teenage mothers may not be educated enough and have complete awareness about precautions to be taken during pregnancy. It becomes therefore essential to offer education and community support to such young girls and also create awareness about contraception to keep them safe from any such experience later upon.<br /><br />Pregnancy in teenage is also a very troubling time for parents of the teenager who have dreamt a bright future ahead for their children. However since the teenager who gets pregnant also undergoes feelings of anger and frustration for the situation that has arrived, it is important that parents keep their anger in control so as to reduce the adolescent’s stress.<br /><br />ADVERTISEMENTS:<br /><br />The parents should get complete medical check up done for the child by a qualified physician in the field and ensure that she gets counseling as well from outside if needed to overcome emotional stress. If both the families of the girl and boy are ready to raise the child properly, it is good. Else adoption should be chosen as the way where some appropriate organization should be chosen to adopt the child.<br /><br />Teenage pregnancy is not socially acceptable in many communities and cultures and therefore the social problems needed to be considered besides giving medical and pre-natal care to the expecting adolescent girl. Children who are born to teenage parents are more likely to face problems with good education because social support may lack in their case. If appropriate community support is offered through child-care support and social services, such children can also get good education and settle as independently earning individuals in the society.<br /><br />A teenage pregnancy is certainly debilitating for the girl child who is often faced with societal and family pressure because of the indiscretion that resulted into her pregnancy. If a teenage girl suffers all the hostility from friends and family, she is not likely to understand and know the aspects of nutrition associated with pregnancy and may give birth to low-weight or malnourished child. Behavioral problems are also common in such children as they do not get to witness the right parental skills that they can imitate.<br /><br />Teen pregnancy becomes an issue of embarrassment for most parents and as a result they do not find it easy to accept the situation and deal with it positively and patiently. Moreover a teen girl is also not bodily prepared to give birth to a child that adds to all other problems that she faces.<br /><br />ADVERTISEMENTS:<br /><br />It is important that such teen parents reenter educational institutions after giving birth to the child so that they can be educated about being better parents in rearing their child. Child care should be accessible and within financial reach of such teen mothers. Many teen parents begin to abuse their children as early as 6 months of age if they also suffered abuse as children. Even more there are higher chances of death associated with teenage pregnancy for the mother as well as the child.<br /><br />Therefore early prenatal care is essential to save the child as well as mother from any complications or serious medical conditions.<br /><br />Teen pregnancy prevention programs like abstinence education, knowledge based programs that guide them about their bodies, clinic focused programs for easier access to sex education and peer counseling programs are some measures that can help control the teenage pregnancy rates in the world.<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The main reason of teenage pregnancy is the lack of parental guidance. Nowadays, teens do what they see in social medias and other medias that they think is cool. Another reason is the lack of sex education. We need to enlighten the teens because this generation is so much different than the others because teens now are more curious and bolder about doing such things.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p>Introduction:</p><p>Teenage pregnancy refers to a pregnancy that occurs in a girl between the ages of 13 to 19 years. Teenage pregnancy has become a serious issue in many countries, as it affects the physical, social, and economic well-being of both the mother and the child. In this essay, we will discuss the causes and consequences of teenage pregnancy and suggest some ways to prevent it.</p><p></p><p>Body:</p><p></p><p>Claim 1: Lack of Sex Education</p><p>One of the main causes of teenage pregnancy is a lack of sex education. Many teenagers lack the knowledge and skills required to make informed decisions about sexual activity. They may not understand the consequences of unprotected sex or know how to use contraceptives effectively. Schools and parents should provide comprehensive sex education that covers topics like puberty, contraception, sexually transmitted infections, and healthy relationships.</p><p></p><p>Claim 2: Peer Pressure and Influence</p><p>Another reason for teenage pregnancy is peer pressure and influence. Teenagers are often influenced by their peers to engage in sexual activity. They may feel pressure to conform to their peers' expectations or to prove their maturity. This pressure can lead them to engage in risky sexual behaviors, such as having unprotected sex. Parents and teachers can help teenagers develop strong self-esteem and decision-making skills to resist negative peer pressure.</p><p></p><p>Claim 3: Social and Economic Consequences</p><p>Teenage pregnancy has serious social and economic consequences for both the mother and the child. Teenage mothers are more likely to drop out of school, have lower-paying jobs, and experience poverty. They may also experience mental health issues, such as depression and anxiety. Their children may suffer from poor health, lower academic achievement, and limited opportunities. Governments, schools, and communities can provide support and resources to help teenage mothers finish their education, find employment, and raise healthy children.</p><p></p><p>Conclusion:</p><p>Teenage pregnancy is a complex issue that requires a multifaceted approach to prevent it. Schools, parents, and communities need to provide comprehensive sex education, develop strong decision-making skills, and provide support and resources to teenage mothers. By addressing the root causes of teenage pregnancy, we can reduce the social and economic consequences for both the mother and the child.</p>Introduction<br /><br />Teenage pregnancy is becoming a pressing issue in today’s society as more and more young women are becoming pregnant at an alarmingly young age. While there are many factors that contribute to teenage pregnancy, such as lack of education, a lack of support systems, or access to contraceptives, the consequences of teenage pregnancy can be immense and can result in a host of long-term social and economic implications. However, there are ways to address teenage pregnancy, from introducing comprehensive sex education in schools, to providing resources for young pregnant women and mothers to raise healthy and happy children.<br /><br />Body<br /><br />Teenage pregnancy is becoming a serious issue for both developed and developing countries, with around 16 million adolescent girls between the ages of 15 and 19 giving birth each year. These figures include births within marriages, but many of these young mothers are unmarried and are not prepared for the challenges of parenting. Unfortunately, many of these teenage pregnancies are unwanted and result in the birth of an unplanned child, impacting an unprepared family financially, socially, and emotionally.<br /><br />In terms of education, teenage mothers who become pregnant risk dropping out of school, leading to fewer opportunities for them to achieve economic and social success. In addition, teenage pregnancy can have a profound psychological impact on the mother and her child. Mothers may be at increased risk of depression and anxiety, while the child may be born with health complications or cognitive deficits, resulting in a lower educational attainment than those of children born to older parents.<br /><br />Furthermore, teenage pregnancy places a significant fiscal burden on the economy. Countries are required to invest in healthcare for pregnant mothers and babies, as well as providing welfare payments for young mothers and their families. Additionally, a lack of access to contraceptives and education about contraception can further contribute to the problem of teenage pregnancy.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />Teenage pregnancy is an increasingly pressing issue and is highly detrimental to a young woman’s health, education, and financial prospects. It can also have a serious social and economic burden on society, as well. However, by introducing comprehensive sex education and developing support systems for young mothers, the rate of teenage pregnancy can be reduced. Although the consequences of teenage pregnancy can be immense, with the right support and resources it is possible to reduce its prevalence and enable young mothers to raise healthy and happy children.<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>One major source of confusion in the literature dealing with teen pregnancy and childbearing is precisely the distinction between pregnancy and its outcomes. People often say they're referring to teenage pregnancy when they only have information on births. Pregnancy can be resolved in a number of ways, only one of which is a live birth kept by the mother. However, in talking about the problems of teen pregnancy, the problems that have been well-documented to date are those associated with that one outcome—bearing and raising a child as a teenager.</p><br />
