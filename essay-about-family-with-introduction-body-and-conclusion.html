                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Alcohol abuse and alcoholism within a family is a problem that can destroy a marriage or drive a wedge between members. That means people who drink can blow through the family budget, cause fights, ignore children, and otherwise impair the health and happiness of the people they love. In time, family members may even develop symptoms of codependency, inadvertently keeping the addiction alive, even though it harms them. Family therapy and rehab can help. Alcoholism, although thought mostly of its impact on the alcoholic themselves, it is also a very present problem in the ruining of his or her friends and their families lives. Someone who may be a fully functional, great person to his or her family may be extremely dangerous, dishonest, and destructive while they are under the influence of alcohol. This instance occurs in "The Glass Castle" with Rex Walls and also occurs regularly in our society today, such as abusive parents, and husbands. Without alcohol Rex was intelligent, responsible, honest, and a overallAlcoholism is having on our society are accidents are happening and people are dying. Another problem that alcoholism is having on our society is people are drinking their problems away and then they end up becoming addicted to alcohol. Alcohol is affecting our society by when people are becoming addicted to alcohol they can become very abusive. Alcoholism is also affects the society by families leaving the alcoholic because of they’re addicted to alcohol. One other way that alcoholism affects our society is people start to gain a lot of weight then they end up being on their way to become obese. Alcohol can also affect our society is some people can end up thinking that alcohol is more important than they’re family </p><p>This affects our society because when the kids of alcoholics feel everything is their fault they will try to right their wrongs which will be their focus which can take a very long time. This is important because when the kids of alcoholics feel hurt they’re going to start to become outcasts which can make them be in the shadow of all the people talking. This affects our society by when people become outcasts they are the people in society who do not say anything in society . This is important because when kids start to feel angry they act out seeking for attention which can make them get in trouble with the law or the students can start getting in trouble school, possibly they can get kicked out if school if they keep on acting </p><p>This is important because when kids of alcoholics are born with physical and mental birth defects they can become outcasts in school. This affects our society by when kids are made fun of because of the physical and birth defects they can start to become overwhelmed and they can start to have suicidal thoughts.</p><p>Alcoholism affects families physically is ‘’Children are more susceptible to child abuse, including incest and battery’’ ( Learn About Alcoholism). This is important because when kids get abused they can start to have bad dreams and experiences of being abused. This affects our society by kids of alcoholics start to have later problems in life and they start to have a difficult time trusting people which can make them outcasts.</p><p>Alcoholism affects families psychologically by “Neglect people from doing their responsibilities with work, home, life, and school’’ (American Addiction). This is important because the people get a distraction that makes them focus on other things that are not going to make their lives better. This affects our society by the families of alcoholics getting distracted they don’t notice that things are not getting better until they take a closer look at what they are doing</p><br />

                        <p>Alcohol puts the brakes on your immune system. Your body can't make the numbers of white blood cells it needs to fight germs. So for 24 hours after drinking, you're more likely to get sick. Long-term, heavy drinkers are much more likely to get illnesses like pneumonia and tuberculosis. Alcohol causes more than just trouble for the person drinking, especially with prolonged alcohol misuse and abuse. Because addiction can negatively affect several areas of a person's life, often alcoholism impacts family and friends as well. One way in which alcoholism affects families is in damaged relationships. Families if people affected by alcohol abuse often struggle to create strong emotional bonds, even within their family unit. This stars with the parents.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p> HOPE IT HELPS! GOD BLESS </p><p></p><br />
