Colors may just seem simple and unimportant, but they affect our daily lives more han we may know. If someone is feeling angry, it could just be because they're angry. or it could be perhaps that they are surrounded by or looking at the color red. That's right: People's moods can change just because they are looking at different colors There are many theories on how just a simple color can change one's whole mood According to Johnson (2007), color does affect mood by producing certain chemicals and stimulating different feelings such as hunger. For example, blue can make one leel calin because it releases calming chemicals, and red can make one hunen because it is an appetite stimulant. Yellow can make one feel irritated, and it isuren that people lose their iemper most in yellow rooms. However, pink is tranquilizing and can make one feel weak. In conclusion, Johnson says that depending on the color, one's body can do things like producing chemicals) that cause a certain emotional reaction (mad, sad, etc.). Another idea, by Sruith (2007), is that the effect color produces is based on what one's body does in response. For example, vellow is mentally stimulating, and activates memory, whereas red increases confidence. Also, brown can make a person fecl orderly and stable, while a dark blue can make one leel sad Therefore, Smith says that different colors do in fact change one s mood and the consequences can be negative or positive. I third writer Wollard. (2000) seems to think that color can alleet one's mood, but the effect also can depend on one's culture and what one's personal reflection may be for example, someone from Japan may not associate red with anger, as people from the US tend to do so a person who likes the color brown may Associate brown with happiness. However Holland does think that colors can make everyone feel the same, or close to the same mood. According to Wollard, pink reduces aggression, which is why the walls of the cells in the Seattle prison are pink! Also, brown can make one feel comforted. Wolland feels that colors do aficct oncs mood, but there are other factors that can alter that one supposed to feel Enc, John and Paraag' (2007) main point about color Example green makes people feel relaxed because it relaxes their muscles and makes sychology is that color has both physiological and psychological cflect. For them breathe deeper and more slowly. Furthermore blue lower blood pressure mood because of what it does to the body. Yet another idea by lucy (2000). is that which makes one fcel calm. Eric John, and Para conclude that color atlects ones is energy, and it can have a physical, mental, spiritual and or emotional effect can also make one feel depressed. Also brown can make a person feel reliable and people. He states that black anake one feel sophisticated and secure, but it can have dillerent kinds itellects all prople. color CO Q4 ENGLISH10 MODULE 1​</a>

Answer the given questions on the text boxesThe School Uniform Question1 Individualism in a fundamental part of society in many countries. Most people believe in the right to express their own opinion without fear of punishment. This value, however, is coming under fire in an unlikely place the public school classroom. The issue is school uniforms. Should public school students be allowed to make individual decisions about clothing, or should all students be required to wear a uniform? School uniforms are the better choice for three reasons2 First, wearing school uniforms would help make students' lives simpler. They would no longer have to decide what to wear every morning, sometimes trying on outfit after outfit in an effort to choose Uniforms would not only save time but also would eliminate the stressoften associated with this chore.Second, school uniforms influence students to act responsibly in groups and as individuals. Uniforms give students the message that school is a special place for learning. In addition, uniforms create a feeling of unity among students. For example, when students do something as a group, such as attend meetings in the auditorium or eat lunch in the cafeteria, the fact that they all wear the same uniform gives them a sense of community. Even more important, statistics show the positive effects that school uniforms have on violence and truancy. According to a recent survey in a large school district in Florida, incidents of school violence dropped by 30 percent, attendance and test scores improved, and student suspensions declined approximately 30 percent after school uniforms were introducedFinally, school uniforms would help make all the students feel equal. Students' standards of living differ greatly from family to family, and some people are well-off while others are not. People sometimes forget that school is a place to get an education, not to promote a "fashion show. Implementing mandatory school uniforms would make all the students look the same regardless of their financial status. School uniforms would promote pride and help to raise the self-esteem of students who cannot afford to wear expensive clothing3HEALTHY PERSONTransmission Probabilitywithout markTransmission ProbabilityLOWTransmission Probability LOWESTwith mask1.

This story reminds me of a vacation we had in Baguio last summer is an example of text to world connection3. Text to world connections are the larger connections that a reader bringe to a reading situation4 Making connections is truly NOT as vital as a comprehension skill since it helps you relate and connect what you heard/read and viewed5. This movie is similar to the passage I read before whose author and editor is the same person is an example of text to world connection6. How is this text/picture/video similar to other things I've read/viewed? le a question usually associated with text to text connection7. Some of the common questions that you can ask in using text to sell connection are: What does this remind me of something in my life? What is this similar to in my life How is this different from my life? Has something like this ever happened to me?8. Text-to-World is connecting real world happenings to texts 9.

It was the summer of 1997, I was poor and on a budget. I came just for the day, on a National Express coach from Cambridge. I was a little uneasy because the driver spoke loudly in a cockney accent, had a shaven head and tattoos that snaked up his arms from his wrists and disappeared into his short sleeves. Dark thoughts of what skinheads did to black people in Europe entered my mind. “Here you go darlin’,” he said as he handed me my change. I was disarmed.London lived in my imagination long before I saw it. On that first visit, I wanted to see everything. From the top of several “hop on, hop off” buses, I saw Pudding Lane and Westminster Abbey, the Old Bailey, the sparkling, dirty Thames and the many sights and places that I knew from books and television. By four in the afternoon, I was London-glutted and sight-sore. “Coming up is Marble Arch,” said our tour guide. I immediately thought of Jeff Buckley’s “Hallelujah”. My best friend David Ottewell had introduced me to his music the month before, only for Buckley to drown a few weeks after I first heard him. I hopped off the bus and walked into Hyde Park from the Marble Arch entrance. It was as good a place as any to eat my sandwich lunch.As I walked into the park, I almost became part of a crowd of Hare Krishna followers. The small enthusiastic crowd was mainly middle-aged, the men in white linen trousers and tunics, the women looking incongruous in clothes from two continents separated by a vast ocean: they wore saris accessorised with colourful woven bags from Latin America. They thrust up their arms and danced their way through the park as everyone but the tourists ignored them.I walked away from the Hare Krishnas and found myself at Speakers’ Corner. I listened to a bearded Christian evangelist preaching hell and brimstone in such soft tones that he did not appear to be particularly convinced of the impending doom he prophesied. There was also a member of the International Socialists organisation, who talked as though the Berlin Wall was still to fall, and a group of students campaigning against a multinational that was forcing infant formula on women in developing countries, making me feel terribly guilty because all I could think of was one of the multinational’s famed chocolate bars.I took that as a prompt to have my late lunch, and walked to eat it in the loveliness of the Rose Garden. After my meal, I turned right and found myself in Rotten Row. I felt immediately homesick for Zimbabwe. There are not many Rotten Rows in the world, and one of them is in Harare. I spent an hour wandering in a happy daze in Hyde Park.I have visited Hyde Park many times since then, and have come to love other sights that I missed that day — particularly the moving Holocaust Memorial with its text from the Book of Lamentations — but the charm of the first visit has never left me.Speakers’ Corner speaks to the quality I love most about the British: their tolerance for eccentricityIt is one of my favourite places in London. Speakers’ Corner is famously associated with freedom of speech but, to me, it speaks to the quality that I love the most about the British: their tolerance for eccentricity. And that day showed me another quality that I love in big-city dwellers — not just Londoners but those of other big cities too. Coming from a city in the guise of a village, where to be present is to invite attention and loud comment on your clothes, your hair, your very being, I loved that there was an accepted code of behaviour about being private in public, and that I could disappear into my own world in the middle of a communal park.I love Hyde Park also because it reminds me of home, not only because of Rotten Row but because it gives me an idea of what my city’s planners had in mind when they put the Harare Gardens, my city’s largest park, in the middle of the city. As I left the park through Hyde Park Corner that day in 1997, I walked away with an idea in my mind of the kind of place that my city could have become, of the kind of place that Harare still could be when, and if ever, it grows up.​</a>

                                            Why Pinoy students ranked last in reading comprehension surveyMANILA - Filipino students ranked last among 79 countries in a global survey of reading comprehension because they are more used to narrative instead of informative text materials, a group said Thursday:Frederick Sotto Perez, president of the Reading Association of the Philippines, said this was the first time that the country joined the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).The country joined the global survey which will provide us baseline data for our curriculum," he said. "The texts in the exam) are mainly informational and the evaluation of the text and understanding revolved on informational text and not narrative, to which our students are used to in the Philippines," Perez told ANC's Early Edition"People are alarmed by the results. This alarm may lead us to a more reflective education which we went to pursue."Perez said children should be taught expository texts that focus on factual information, at the age of 9."Reading ability is developed through practice. We can only develop fluent readers if we provide them with text, print and digital, and we practice them through teacher modeling, shared practice towards independent practice, he said.Another reason for Filipino students tenking last in the exam is poor connectivity in far-flung areas, Perez said, noting that the country "lacks reading materials." There's no internet, boolas are mainly children's books, and there are noencyclopedias and other digital texts," he said."Books and printed text are very essential. Reading culture may be promoted in schools through extended literacy projects, book talks of teachers. Schools should be active in fostering a reading culture by actually making their libraries functional."Students must also be taught to discern the credibility of a text which was one aspect that PISA tested, Perez added."I think it's important we know how to evaluate sources, that is being taught in high school, check the facts and actually cross-check," he said."Even in social media, for example, we see our students always sharing online without discerning what kind of texts they are sharing with other people."Teachers and parents must also be guided in handling digital literacy Perez said as he emphasized that all educators should be "reading teachers.""All teachers should undergo reading instruction strategy training. Our students to be able to do research should know how to read articles and facts, evaluate them, citation, distinguishing fact from opinion," he said."But if our teachers for example in science, social studies, or math are not equipped in helping our students develop those skills, the blame goes to our reading teachers."what is your personal opinion towards the subject of the new article? cite you belief or opinions why you think filipino students ranked last in the reading comprehension survey.​</a>

                                            For questions 4-6In Biology, the relationship between species in which at least onespecies benefits is called symbiosis. The relationship varies with differentspecies. Some may be positive, negative, or neutral. There are three basictypes of symbiosis - mutualism, commensalism, and parasitism. Theserelationships can be likened to how humans deal with the environment.The first one is mutualism. It is a relationship between two speciesof organisms in which both benefit from the association. An example isthe relationship between a butterfly and a flower. Both benefit from eachother. This happens in the environment as well. There are programs thatfocus on taking care of the environment. People benefit from the resourcesthey get from it. And the environment, on the other hand, benefits fromhumans when they take care of these resources. If this type ofrelationship is what is practiced all the time, then the earth would not bein the bad shape it is in right now.4. What is the text all about?5.

Additional Activity Read the text below and label the research below using the elements of restarch (Title, Introduction, Methodology, Results and Discussions, Conclusion and References) Color Psychology Paper How does color affect one's mood? Colors may just seem simple and unimportant, but they affect our daily lives more han we may know. If someone is feeling angry, it could just be because they're angry. or it could be perhaps that they are surrounded by or looking at the color red. That's right: People's moods can change just because they are looking at different colors There are many theories on how just a simple color can change one's whole mood According to Johnson (2007), color does affect mood by producing certain chemicals and stimulating different feelings such as hunger. For example, blue can make one leel calin because it releases calming chemicals, and red can make one hunen because it is an appetite stimulant. Yellow can make one feel irritated, and it isuren that people lose their iemper most in yellow rooms. However, pink is tranquilizing and can make one feel weak. In conclusion, Johnson says that depending on the color, one's body can do things like producing chemicals) that cause a certain emotional reaction (mad, sad, etc.). Another idea, by Sruith (2007), is that the effect color produces is based on what one's body does in response. For example, vellow is mentally stimulating, and activates memory, whereas red increases confidence. Also, brown can make a person fecl orderly and stable, while a dark blue can make one leel sad Therefore, Smith says that different colors do in fact change one s mood and the consequences can be negative or positive. I third writer Wollard. (2000) seems to think that color can alleet one's mood, but the effect also can depend on one's culture and what one's personal reflection may be for example, someone from Japan may not associate red with anger, as people from the US tend to do so a person who likes the color brown may Associate brown with happiness. However Holland does think that colors can make everyone feel the same, or close to the same mood. According to Wollard, pink reduces aggression, which is why the walls of the cells in the Seattle prison are pink! Also, brown can make one feel comforted. Wolland feels that colors do aficct oncs mood, but there are other factors that can alter that one supposed to feel Enc, John and Paraag' (2007) main point about color Example green makes people feel relaxed because it relaxes their muscles and makes sychology is that color has both physiological and psychological cflect. For them breathe deeper and more slowly. Furthermore blue lower blood pressure mood because of what it does to the body. Yet another idea by lucy (2000). is that which makes one fcel calm. Eric John, and Para conclude that color atlects ones is energy, and it can have a physical, mental, spiritual and or emotional effect can also make one feel depressed. Also brown can make a person feel reliable and people. He states that black anake one feel sophisticated and secure, but it can have dillerent kinds itellects all prople. color CO Q4 ENGLISH10 MODULE 1​</h2><br />

Answer the given questions on the text boxesThe School Uniform Question1 Individualism in a fundamental part of society in many countries. Most people believe in the right to express their own opinion without fear of punishment. This value, however, is coming under fire in an unlikely place the public school classroom. The issue is school uniforms. Should public school students be allowed to make individual decisions about clothing, or should all students be required to wear a uniform? School uniforms are the better choice for three reasons2 First, wearing school uniforms would help make students' lives simpler. They would no longer have to decide what to wear every morning, sometimes trying on outfit after outfit in an effort to choose Uniforms would not only save time but also would eliminate the stressoften associated with this chore.Second, school uniforms influence students to act responsibly in groups and as individuals. Uniforms give students the message that school is a special place for learning. In addition, uniforms create a feeling of unity among students. For example, when students do something as a group, such as attend meetings in the auditorium or eat lunch in the cafeteria, the fact that they all wear the same uniform gives them a sense of community. Even more important, statistics show the positive effects that school uniforms have on violence and truancy. According to a recent survey in a large school district in Florida, incidents of school violence dropped by 30 percent, attendance and test scores improved, and student suspensions declined approximately 30 percent after school uniforms were introducedFinally, school uniforms would help make all the students feel equal. Students' standards of living differ greatly from family to family, and some people are well-off while others are not. People sometimes forget that school is a place to get an education, not to promote a "fashion show.

Text to self connections are highly personal connections that a reader makes between a piece of reading material and the reader's own experiences or lite2. This story reminds me of a vacation we had in Baguio last summer is an example of text to world connection3. Text to world connections are the larger connections that a reader bringe to a reading situation4 Making connections is truly NOT as vital as a comprehension skill since it helps you relate and connect what you heard/read and viewed5. This movie is similar to the passage I read before whose author and editor is the same person is an example of text to world connection6. How is this text/picture/video similar to other things I've read/viewed? le a question usually associated with text to text connection7. Some of the common questions that you can ask in using text to sell connection are: What does this remind me of something in my life? What is this similar to in my life How is this different from my life? Has something like this ever happened to me?8. Text-to-World is connecting real world happenings to texts 9. When we connect what we read from books to ourselves we are connecting with text to self9. When we connect what we read from books to ourselves we are connecting with text-to-self10.

Give 2 other topics that can be featured in creative-nonfiction"Hyde Park" By: Petina Gappah	I was a student when I made my first visit to London. It was the summer of 1997, I was poor and on a budget. I came just for the day, on a National Express coach from Cambridge. I was a little uneasy because the driver spoke loudly in a cockney accent, had a shaven head and tattoos that snaked up his arms from his wrists and disappeared into his short sleeves. Dark thoughts of what skinheads did to black people in Europe entered my mind. “Here you go darlin’,” he said as he handed me my change. I was disarmed.London lived in my imagination long before I saw it. On that first visit, I wanted to see everything. From the top of several “hop on, hop off” buses, I saw Pudding Lane and Westminster Abbey, the Old Bailey, the sparkling, dirty Thames and the many sights and places that I knew from books and television. By four in the afternoon, I was London-glutted and sight-sore. “Coming up is Marble Arch,” said our tour guide. I immediately thought of Jeff Buckley’s “Hallelujah”. My best friend David Ottewell had introduced me to his music the month before, only for Buckley to drown a few weeks after I first heard him. I hopped off the bus and walked into Hyde Park from the Marble Arch entrance. It was as good a place as any to eat my sandwich lunch.As I walked into the park, I almost became part of a crowd of Hare Krishna followers. The small enthusiastic crowd was mainly middle-aged, the men in white linen trousers and tunics, the women looking incongruous in clothes from two continents separated by a vast ocean: they wore saris accessorised with colourful woven bags from Latin America. They thrust up their arms and danced their way through the park as everyone but the tourists ignored them.I walked away from the Hare Krishnas and found myself at Speakers’ Corner. I listened to a bearded Christian evangelist preaching hell and brimstone in such soft tones that he did not appear to be particularly convinced of the impending doom he prophesied. There was also a member of the International Socialists organisation, who talked as though the Berlin Wall was still to fall, and a group of students campaigning against a multinational that was forcing infant formula on women in developing countries, making me feel terribly guilty because all I could think of was one of the multinational’s famed chocolate bars.I took that as a prompt to have my late lunch, and walked to eat it in the loveliness of the Rose Garden. After my meal, I turned right and found myself in Rotten Row. I felt immediately homesick for Zimbabwe. There are not many Rotten Rows in the world, and one of them is in Harare. I spent an hour wandering in a happy daze in Hyde Park.I have visited Hyde Park many times since then, and have come to love other sights that I missed that day — particularly the moving Holocaust Memorial with its text from the Book of Lamentations — but the charm of the first visit has never left me.Speakers’ Corner speaks to the quality I love most about the British: their tolerance for eccentricityIt is one of my favourite places in London. Speakers’ Corner is famously associated with freedom of speech but, to me, it speaks to the quality that I love the most about the British: their tolerance for eccentricity. And that day showed me another quality that I love in big-city dwellers — not just Londoners but those of other big cities too. Coming from a city in the guise of a village, where to be present is to invite attention and loud comment on your clothes, your hair, your very being, I loved that there was an accepted code of behaviour about being private in public, and that I could disappear into my own world in the middle of a communal park.I love Hyde Park also because it reminds me of home, not only because of Rotten Row but because it gives me an idea of what my city’s planners had in mind when they put the Harare Gardens, my city’s largest park, in the middle of the city. As I left the park through Hyde Park Corner that day in 1997, I walked away with an idea in my mind of the kind of place that my city could have become, of the kind of place that Harare still could be when, and if ever, it grows up.​</h2><br />

                            13. Why Pinoy students ranked last in reading comprehension surveyMANILA - Filipino students ranked last among 79 countries in a global survey of reading comprehension because they are more used to narrative instead of informative text materials, a group said Thursday:Frederick Sotto Perez, president of the Reading Association of the Philippines, said this was the first time that the country joined the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).The country joined the global survey which will provide us baseline data for our curriculum," he said. "The texts in the exam) are mainly informational and the evaluation of the text and understanding revolved on informational text and not narrative, to which our students are used to in the Philippines," Perez told ANC's Early Edition"People are alarmed by the results. This alarm may lead us to a more reflective education which we went to pursue."Perez said children should be taught expository texts that focus on factual information, at the age of 9."Reading ability is developed through practice. We can only develop fluent readers if we provide them with text, print and digital, and we practice them through teacher modeling, shared practice towards independent practice, he said.Another reason for Filipino students tenking last in the exam is poor connectivity in far-flung areas, Perez said, noting that the country "lacks reading materials." There's no internet, boolas are mainly children's books, and there are noencyclopedias and other digital texts," he said."Books and printed text are very essential. Reading culture may be promoted in schools through extended literacy projects, book talks of teachers. Schools should be active in fostering a reading culture by actually making their libraries functional."Students must also be taught to discern the credibility of a text which was one aspect that PISA tested, Perez added."I think it's important we know how to evaluate sources, that is being taught in high school, check the facts and actually cross-check," he said."Even in social media, for example, we see our students always sharing online without discerning what kind of texts they are sharing with other people."Teachers and parents must also be guided in handling digital literacy Perez said as he emphasized that all educators should be "reading teachers.""All teachers should undergo reading instruction strategy training. Our students to be able to do research should know how to read articles and facts, evaluate them, citation, distinguishing fact from opinion," he said."But if our teachers for example in science, social studies, or math are not equipped in helping our students develop those skills, the blame goes to our reading teachers."what is your personal opinion towards the subject of the new article? cite you belief or opinions why you think filipino students ranked last in the reading comprehension survey.​</h2><br />

                            15. For questions 4-6In Biology, the relationship between species in which at least onespecies benefits is called symbiosis. The relationship varies with differentspecies. Some may be positive, negative, or neutral. There are three basictypes of symbiosis - mutualism, commensalism, and parasitism. Theserelationships can be likened to how humans deal with the environment.The first one is mutualism. It is a relationship between two speciesof organisms in which both benefit from the association. An example isthe relationship between a butterfly and a flower. Both benefit from eachother. This happens in the environment as well. There are programs thatfocus on taking care of the environment. People benefit from the resourcesthey get from it. And the environment, on the other hand, benefits fromhumans when they take care of these resources. If this type ofrelationship is what is practiced all the time, then the earth would not bein the bad shape it is in right now.4. What is the text all about?5.
