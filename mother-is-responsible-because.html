                            6. The only planet in the solar system that sustains life is the planet Earth. Earth sustains life because of the atmosphere.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>The atmosphere is thin and light, a gas that is only bound to the solid mass of the Earth by gravity. The mass of the atmosphere is about 250 times less than that of the oceans and accounts for less than one millionth of the total mass of the planet. The atmospheric pressure and density of air decrease exponentially with height above the surface. The term ‘exponentially’ means that for every increase in height by the same distance, the atmospheric density falls by the same factor. In the case of the Earth, density halves for every increase of around 5.9 km in altitude. At the top of Mount Everest (8.85 km above sea-level), about 70% of the atmosphere is already beneath your feet. Contrast this with the radius of the Earth itself, around 6,371 km. The atmosphere is really a very thin skin.</p><p></p><p><strong>Carry On Learning :)</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            14. EXPLAIN THE ROLE OF MARY IN THE STORY OF SALVATION.
- Marian devotions are external pious practices directed to the person of Mary, Mother of Jesus, by members of certain Christian traditions. Mary has a unique and priviledge place and salvation history in the church. Because she responded yes to becoming the Mother of God, she is our model of discipleship and our model of grace and trust in God.
These moments in Mary's life offer the opportunity to learn from her and emulate her response to God. Mary teaches us how to lead our lives in faith and hope and love.</h2><br />
                        <p>Answer:</p><p>Mary enables the Incarnation and the salvation of the world (unlike Pilate and the Apostles), and she does so knowingly and freely (unlike any of her ancestors). The Virgin Mary alone gives Jesus something that He doesn't already have: a human nature, and its accompanying mortality.</p><p>Explanation: It is through Mary that salvation (=Christ) came to us but she is not salvation. She is the first redeemed person through Jesus. Catholic faith does not obligate us to believe in Mary as the mandatory way to or source of salvation.Mary is one of those spiritual friends: unobtrusive, available and compassionate.</p><p></p><br />
