                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>Senior High School Strand</strong></p><p>Senior High School is a two-year specialized upper secondary education program in which students can specialize based on their aptitude, hobbies, and school competence. The substance of a student's subjects in Grades 11 and 12 will be determined by his or her professional path. Subjects in SHS are divided into two categories: Core Curriculum and Tracks.</p><p></p><p><strong>THE ESSENTIAL CURRICULUM</strong></p><p>The Core Curriculum is divided into seven learning areas. Languages, Literature, Communication, Mathematics, Philosophy, Natural Sciences, and Social Sciences are the disciplines in question. The SHS curriculum includes current topics from various General Education subjects.</p><p></p><p><strong>TRACKS</strong></p><p>Academic, Technical-Vocational-Livelihood, and Sports and Arts are the three tracks available to Senior High School students. Business, Accountancy, and Management (BAM); Humanities, Education, and Social Sciences (HESS); and Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) .</p><p></p><p><strong>STEM STRAND</strong></p><p>When implemented in the actual world, science, technology, engineering, and mathematics are intertwined disciplines. The focus on advanced concepts and themes distinguishes the STEM curriculum from the other strands and tracks.</p><p></p><p>You can train to be a pilot, an architect, an astrophysicist, a biologist, a chemist, an engineer, a dentist, a nutritionist, a nurse, a doctor, and many more professions by following the track. This track is recommended for those who are also interested in Marine Engineering.</p><p></p><p>STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) teaches critical thinking and innovation. Students can establish mental habits that will help them succeed in any subject by focusing on logical thought processes and problem-solving. Students are challenged to think critically and come up with their own ideas as part of their STEM training.</p><p></p><p>A great STEM class promotes critical thinking, problem-solving, perseverance, teamwork, and communication. Good STEM education enables students to see the connections between these courses and to acquire soft skills for the world in which we all live and work.</p><p></p><p>I like the critical thinking to be enhanced and in STEM strand, it will be well practiced with the help of the assessment given all throughout the curriculum.</p><p></p><p><strong>Other Senior High School Strands</strong></p><p><strong>1.
