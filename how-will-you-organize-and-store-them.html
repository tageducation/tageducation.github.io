It helps you understand how to prevent extinction of organisms inan ecosystemIn this module, you will learn that all organisms need energy to sustain lifeYour study will focus on how organisms obtain energy from food and how organismsproduce energyIn order to sustain life, all organisms require energy, but not all of them canuse light energy directly for life activities. To provide the energy needed by allorganisms, plants and other chlorophyll-bearing organisms capture the energy ofsunlight and convert it into chemical energy stored in the food. When people andother heterotrophic organisms eat food from producers and consumers, chemicalenergy stored from food is transferred to their bodies. Do you know how theseprocesses are being done by our body and by other living organisms?What are expected of you to learn in this module?1. Differentiate basic features and importance of photosynthesis and respirationa) Describe the parts of organelles involved in photosynthesis and cellularrespirationb) Describe the process of food making by plants.c) Describe how stored energy from food is changed to chemical energy for celld) Identify the factors that affect the rate of bhotouse.​</a>

It helps you understand how to prevent extinction of organisms inan ecosystemIn this module, you will learn that all organisms need energy to sustain lifeYour study will focus on how organisms obtain energy from food and how organismsproduce energyIn order to sustain life, all organisms require energy, but not all of them canuse light energy directly for life activities. To provide the energy needed by allorganisms, plants and other chlorophyll-bearing organisms capture the energy ofsunlight and convert it into chemical energy stored in the food. When people andother heterotrophic organisms eat food from producers and consumers, chemicalenergy stored from food is transferred to their bodies. Do you know how theseprocesses are being done by our body and by other living organisms?What are expected of you to learn in this module?1. Differentiate basic features and importance of photosynthesis and respirationa) Describe the parts of organelles involved in photosynthesis and cellularrespirationb) Describe the process of food making by plants.c) Describe how stored energy from food is changed to chemical energy for celld) Identify the factors that affect the rate of bhotouse.​</h2><br />
