                                            I am a student of the National University in Manila. I was only in my first year.
As a student I have an observed appreciation of virtue (CORE
VALUES) Like Respect for the elderly when you say "Po and OOpo" respect for each other
classmate's decision Respect for school law. As a nationalian I was
trustworthy such as not cheating on exams Telling the truth and being diligent.
Because I see other N.U. students cleaning outside the University. As a
student, it's not easy either because you have to pass a lot of exams
memorize and study so that you can pass every science. I see the unity of each
National because in one class there are different courses such as Marketing, HRM and others
pa. You can see in them that they get along well with every project of our school. I remember
when I was new to this school I got lost and asked my neighbor
student where my classroom immediately he immediately accompanied me to my room and me
thanked him.Even if there is leftovers in a room it doesn’t disappear like that
I witnessed I saw a cellphone charged in the room I did not move it
so did my classmates because they knew they didn’t return it immediately by the owner and
thanked us and the one I dropped my i.d and wallet I was crying before but there was
knocked on our classroom and introduced that he had picked up my i.d and wallet to my delight
I know there are still such people in the world because most people today can be exploited. .
My experience shows that students here can be trusted with ours
school. The teachers here at N.U. are kind and we can’t leave the classroom without
we have deep knowledge or lessons I learn a lot as a good student.
I believe that youth is the hope of the people. I can make it through
study hard, and avoid vice or any evil deeds such as gambling.
I will also strive to be a good example to my fellow youth. I totally believe
that the simple and small ways I do it is a big help in the development of
country I belong to. Whatever hardship I can bear do not despair
every test as a student many people will actually pull you down but confident
only self is needed, diligence, Perseverance and never forget the faith in us
Dear Lord he will help us and
will guide. The year is fast approaching now let's just strive as a good and
diligent students we will not realize that we will be able to finish school and
one day we will succeed in the life we ​​face.

Five. With narrative research we are better able to capture attitudes, perceptions and connections that cannot be expressed by people when they are asked directly. -Capturing an event through descriptive writing involves paying at close attention to the details by using all of your five senses. Teaching students to write more descriptively will improve their writing by making it more interesting and engaging. -There are a lot of reasons why being persuasive is an important professional development skill in business life, as well as personal, Most importantly, persuasion helps people take actions that will actually be in their benefit, despite the mental roadblocks they might have that prevent them from doing so.(Need lang i-copy paste)​</a>

- But if look deeper and realize without these changes new opportunities of educational institution including teachers will not be open. 
- let me give you some examples: as the years passed educational system of the Philippines is nit that good enough compare to the other country. In short education here were left behind
- curriculum and teaching instructions were not properly developed and teachers knowledge and new opportunities is not spotted.
- But now as you can see, since the day that Deped started its blending its progress with the other country things got better in terms of knowledge and opportunities both teachers and students
- They were able to harness their capability in technology, and broaden their knowledge because of the challenges given by our educational system
- old and traditional way of teaching improved and knowledge given by books were modernized into online which makes us became more flexible
- teachers were given an opportunity to expose and use their skills and creativity just to make teaching more in when it comes to the new era.
- students were challenged to use different ways of getting information and achieving knowledge on their own and that makes them become independent.
To put things in context, the educational system had given an opportunity to us and the teachers. let's not focus on the negative side because after all we did not achieved these levels of knowledge without the changes of the system itself.

- But now as you can see, since the day that Deped started its blending its progress with the other country things got better in terms of knowledge and opportunities both teachers and students
- They were able to harness their capability in technology, and broaden their knowledge because of the challenges given by our educational system
- old and traditional way of teaching improved and knowledge given by books were modernized into online which makes us became more flexible
- teachers were given an opportunity to expose and use their skills and creativity just to make teaching more in when it comes to the new era.
- students were challenged to use different ways of getting information and achieving knowledge on their own and that makes them become independent.
To put things in context, the educational system had given an opportunity to us and the teachers. let's not focus on the negative side because after all we did not achieved these levels of knowledge without the changes of the system itself.

so did my classmates because they knew they didn’t return it immediately by the owner and
thanked us and the one I dropped my i.d and wallet I was crying before but there was
knocked on our classroom and introduced that he had picked up my i.d and wallet to my delight
I know there are still such people in the world because most people today can be exploited. .
My experience shows that students here can be trusted with ours
school. The teachers here at N.U. are kind and we can’t leave the classroom without
we have deep knowledge or lessons I learn a lot as a good student.
I believe that youth is the hope of the people. I can make it through
study hard, and avoid vice or any evil deeds such as gambling.
I will also strive to be a good example to my fellow youth. I totally believe
that the simple and small ways I do it is a big help in the development of
country I belong to. Whatever hardship I can bear do not despair

                        <p><strong>Answer:Processes of learning and the transfer of learning are central to understanding how people develop important competencies. Learning is important because no one is born with the ability to function competently as an adult in society. It is especially important to understand the kinds of learning experiences that lead to transfer, defined as the ability to extend what has been learned in one context to new contexts (e.g., Byrnes, 1996:74). Educators hope that students will transfer learning from one problem to another within a course, from one year in school to another, between school and home, and from school to workplace. Assumptions about transfer accompany the belief that it is better to broadly “educate” people than simply “train” them to perform particular tasks (e.g., Broudy, 1977).
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Measures of transfer play an important role in assessing the quality of people’s learning experiences. Different kinds of learning experiences can look equivalent when tests of learning focus solely on remembering (e.g., on the ability to repeat previously taught facts or procedures), but they can look quite different when tests of transfer are used. Some kinds of learning experiences result in effective memory but poor transfer; others produce effective memory plus positive transfer.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Thorndike and his colleagues were among the first to use transfer tests to examine assumptions about learning (e.g., Thorndike and Woodworth, 1901). One of their goals was to test the doctrine of “formal discipline” that was prevalent at the turn of the century. According to this doctrine, practice by learning Latin and other difficult subjects had broad-based effects, such as developing general skills of learning and attention. But these studies raised serious questions about the fruitfulness of designing educational experiences based on the assumption of formal discipline. Rather than developing some kind of “general skill” or “mental muscle” that affected a wide range of performances, people seemed to learn things that were more specific; see Box 3.1.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Early research on the transfer of learning was guided by theories that emphasized the similarity between conditions of learning and conditions of transfer. Thorndike (1913), for example, hypothesized that the degree of transfer between initial and later learning depends upon the match between</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

With narrative research we are better able to capture attitudes, perceptions and connections that cannot be expressed by people when they are asked directly. -Capturing an event through descriptive writing involves paying at close attention to the details by using all of your five senses. Teaching students to write more descriptively will improve their writing by making it more interesting and engaging. -There are a lot of reasons why being persuasive is an important professional development skill in business life, as well as personal, Most importantly, persuasion helps people take actions that will actually be in their benefit, despite the mental roadblocks they might have that prevent them from doing so.(Need lang i-copy paste)​</h2><br />

- let me give you some examples: as the years passed educational system of the Philippines is nit that good enough compare to the other country. In short education here were left behind
- curriculum and teaching instructions were not properly developed and teachers knowledge and new opportunities is not spotted.
- But now as you can see, since the day that Deped started its blending its progress with the other country things got better in terms of knowledge and opportunities both teachers and students
- They were able to harness their capability in technology, and broaden their knowledge because of the challenges given by our educational system
- old and traditional way of teaching improved and knowledge given by books were modernized into online which makes us became more flexible
- teachers were given an opportunity to expose and use their skills and creativity just to make teaching more in when it comes to the new era.
- students were challenged to use different ways of getting information and achieving knowledge on their own and that makes them become independent.
To put things in context, the educational system had given an opportunity to us and the teachers. let's not focus on the negative side because after all we did not achieved these levels of knowledge without the changes of the system itself.
