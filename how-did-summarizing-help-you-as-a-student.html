read. You may have told about the characters. You may have told about the setting.

summarizing is not just for stories? You can use your summarizing skills to be better
prepared in all your subjects.
Some students have a hard time with science and social studies because there
are lots of new words There is also a lot of information to remember. Research shows
that just writing things down will help you remember them. It works even if you never
read what you wrote again. Wow! That’s a great reason for taking notes.
Did you know that taking notes is summarizing? When you read your science and
social studies textbooks, keep a notebook with lined paper close to you. Most
textbooks are divided into sections that have headings. Headings are like titles in
darker letters. Write down the headings of each section before you read the selection.
As you read, jot down the big ideas. Look for the new words. You can also use your
summary to study!
Answer the following questions based on the reading passage.
1.Why are science and social studies hard for some people?
2. What does research say about writing things down?
3.What is heading in your textbook?
4. Based on the other information in the last paragraph, what do the words jot down
mean?
5. What can you use when you study? 6. Write a summary of the given text. please answer it</a>

are lots of new words There is also a lot of information to remember. Research shows
that just writing things down will help you remember them. It works even if you never
read what you wrote again. Wow! That’s a great reason for taking notes.
Did you know that taking notes is summarizing? When you read your science and
social studies textbooks, keep a notebook with lined paper close to you. Most
textbooks are divided into sections that have headings. Headings are like titles in
darker letters. Write down the headings of each section before you read the selection.
As you read, jot down the big ideas. Look for the new words. You can also use your
summary to study!
Answer the following questions based on the reading passage.
1.Why are science and social studies hard for some people?
2. What does research say about writing things down?
3.What is heading in your textbook?
4. Based on the other information in the last paragraph, what do the words jot down
mean?
