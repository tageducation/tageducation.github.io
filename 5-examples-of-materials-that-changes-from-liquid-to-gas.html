                                            vaporation Evaporation is a process of separating mixtures which involves heating the solution until the solvent evaporates leaving behind the solid residue. Heat being the main component in this process separates the mixtures of solid from a liquid. As liquid goes in the air in a form of gas when heated, changing liquid to gas as an example of physical change. Some examples of evaporation are boiling water, drying clothes, and drying of wet roads after heavy rain. What is It Direction: From the short information that you have read, answer the following questions on the blank provided. Use a separate sheet of paper. 1. What is evaporation? 2. What is needed to achieve evaporation process? 3. Give 3 examples of situation where evaporation process was observed. 4. What kind of material was left behind when mixture was heated? 5. What kind of change is involve in evaporation process?​</a>

                            28. vaporation Evaporation is a process of separating mixtures which involves heating the solution until the solvent evaporates leaving behind the solid residue. Heat being the main component in this process separates the mixtures of solid from a liquid. As liquid goes in the air in a form of gas when heated, changing liquid to gas as an example of physical change. Some examples of evaporation are boiling water, drying clothes, and drying of wet roads after heavy rain.
