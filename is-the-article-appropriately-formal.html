                                            The learner and the learning context
An important issue in relation to the benefits of focused instruction is whether al1 learners can
equally benefit from it. Individual factors such as learner's age and cognitive characteristics, as
well as proficiency level can be seen to play a big role. As for age, while adult learners will be
able to draw on their cognitive resources to engage in explicit learning, young learners are less
likely to benefit from focus on form instruction that places too high cognitive demands on them.
Another important individual difference is the learner's (verbal) analytical abilities, which have
been found to be a good predictor of proficiency in both formal and informal settings (Harley
&amp; Hart, 1997; see also DeKeyser, 2003). Research has pointed out that learners with higher
levels of grammatical sensitivity (a component of language analytic ability) find it easier to
notice formal details of the L2 during second language acquisition (Ranta, 1998). Hence, Sawyer
and Ranta (2001) suggest that an important function of form-focused instruction may be to
compensate for learners' deficiencies in certain components of language aptitude, for example.
grammatical sensitivity.
Learners' proficiency level is also an important factor to take into consideration when
plaming focused instruction. Because research seems to show that beginning learners find it
difficult to focus on meaning and form at once (Celce-Murcia, 1991 ; Van Patten, 1990), the latter
may need to be applied with caution in the case of learners who have to struggle with basic
comprehension problems.
A not less important issue is the learning context. As Fotos (2002) argues, implicit
approaches to grammar instruction may be less appropriate in foreign language settings, where
class-time is limited and there is not enough externa1 communicative input to support continued
awareness, than in second language settings with abundant communicative input inside and
outside the classroom. In such contexts a combination of implicit and explicit approaches may
be more adequate. For example, this author (2002) proposes to incorporate implicit approaches
in lessons in which explicit instruction precedes communicative task performance. The
explanation aims at activating previously developed knowledge (Ausubel, Novak, &amp; Hanesian,
1978) and facilitating the establishment of form-meaning relationships. Provision of subsequent
communicative input containing the target structure is recommended to facilitate continued
awareness of its use in context.
It is to be noted, however, that purely communicative methodology has had only
marginal impact on foreign language teaching settings, where the dominant pedagogy continues
to involve a structural syllabus or, even, grammar translation (Skehan, 1998). In such contexts,
the recent emphasis on focus on form may mislead teachers into believing that their explicit
instructional practices and analytic syllabuses is al1 learners require. Hence, the need to
emphasize the necessity to incorporate form-focused activities in communicative contexts in the
foreign language class.

                                            The learner and the learning context
An important issue in relation to the benefits of focused instruction is whether al1 learners can
equally benefit from it. Individual factors such as learner's age and cognitive characteristics, as
well as proficiency level can be seen to play a big role. As for age, while adult learners will be
able to draw on their cognitive resources to engage in explicit learning, young learners are less
likely to benefit from focus on form instruction that places too high cognitive demands on them.
Another important individual difference is the learner's (verbal) analytical abilities, which have
been found to be a good predictor of proficiency in both formal and informal settings (Harley
&amp; Hart, 1997; see also DeKeyser, 2003). Research has pointed out that learners with higher
levels of grammatical sensitivity (a component of language analytic ability) find it easier to
notice formal details of the L2 during second language acquisition (Ranta, 1998). Hence, Sawyer
and Ranta (2001) suggest that an important function of form-focused instruction may be to
compensate for learners' deficiencies in certain components of language aptitude, for example.
grammatical sensitivity.
Learners' proficiency level is also an important factor to take into consideration when
plaming focused instruction. Because research seems to show that beginning learners find it
difficult to focus on meaning and form at once (Celce-Murcia, 1991 ; Van Patten, 1990), the latter
may need to be applied with caution in the case of learners who have to struggle with basic
comprehension problems.
A not less important issue is the learning context. As Fotos (2002) argues, implicit
approaches to grammar instruction may be less appropriate in foreign language settings, where
class-time is limited and there is not enough externa1 communicative input to support continued
awareness, than in second language settings with abundant communicative input inside and
outside the classroom. In such contexts a combination of implicit and explicit approaches may
be more adequate. For example, this author (2002) proposes to incorporate implicit approaches
in lessons in which explicit instruction precedes communicative task performance. The
explanation aims at activating previously developed knowledge (Ausubel, Novak, &amp; Hanesian,
1978) and facilitating the establishment of form-meaning relationships. Provision of subsequent
communicative input containing the target structure is recommended to facilitate continued
awareness of its use in context.
It is to be noted, however, that purely communicative methodology has had only
marginal impact on foreign language teaching settings, where the dominant pedagogy continues
to involve a structural syllabus or, even, grammar translation (Skehan, 1998). In such contexts,
the recent emphasis on focus on form may mislead teachers into believing that their explicit
instructional practices and analytic syllabuses is al1 learners require. Hence, the need to
emphasize the necessity to incorporate form-focused activities in communicative contexts in the
foreign language class.

City High Enrollment hits 4, 387 online and modular students 
Programs for the new normal, beefed up
 By Aldrin S. Quila
 Tribune Post 
Nov. 2-8, 2020 issue 
Despite the pandemic, the school has formally recorded 2, 180 male students and 2, 207 female students comprising the 7% (302 students) of Online Distance Learning Modality (ODL) and 95% (4, 061 students) of Modular Distance Learning modality (MML). Secondary Principal III, Lina M. Laguras emphasized during an interview that the school is now ready for the new normal despite the situation that San Pablo is in. “Through careful crafting and implementing the Learning Continuity Plan (LCP) which serves as the springboard or map, we were able to successfully operate the school opening this year, Dr. Laguras said. Along with the celebration of Teachers’ day last October 5, San Pablo City International High School (SPCIHS) officially welcomed the close to 4, 500 online and offline students who enrolled this academic year 2020-2022. She also added that since the school offers both online and modular classes, its enrolees increased and some problems might be encountered. “Some of the problems we that are now facing is the over-crowded numbers of transferees since we open our school to a wider span as we follow the Education for All Law, but through the collaborative efforts of the Central and Regional Office of Department of Education (DepEd), Local Government Unit (LGU) and City Government of San Pablo led by City Governor Loreto “Amben” Amante, DepEd-San Pablo City spearheaded by Schools Division Superintendent Daisy Miranda Ed. D, teachers and those who support our school, we are trying our best to render good services and quality education for all,” the principal said. Meanwhile, she reminded everyone to spread Positivity and Hope instead of hates and rants; thus, to continue support the education amidst pandemic. On the other hand, Assistant Regional Director Ruth L. Fuentes visited the school last October 8 and inspected the facilities, enrollment, implementation of LCP, modules distributions as well as the preparedness of the school for the said new normal. Last September, the school conducted its face-to-face Parents’ Orientation and distributed modules to the parents while strictly following the safety protocols.</a>

                                            President Rodrigo Duterte has issued a proclamation formally declaring a state of public health emergency throughout the Philippines after the health department reported the first known local transmission of the new coronavirus disease (Covid-19). Duterte signed Proclamation 922 on March 8 to “capacitate government agencies and LGUs (local government units) to immediately act to prevent loss of life, utilize appropriate resources to implement urgent and critical measures to contain or prevent the spread of Covid-19, mitigate its effects and impact to the community, and prevent serious disruption of the functioning of the government and the community.” The proclamation would also facilitate the implementation of mandatory reporting, intensify government response and measures, and enforce quarantine and disease control prevention measures. State of Public Health Emergency Declared in PH by Azer Parrocha President Rodrigo Duterte has issued a proclamation formally declaring a state of public health emergency throughout the Philippines after the health department reported the first known local transmission of the new coronavirus disease (Covid-19). Duterte signed Proclamation 922 on March 8 to “capacitate government agencies and LGUs (local government units) to immediately act to prevent loss of life, utilize appropriate resources to implement urgent and critical measures to contain or prevent the spread of Covid-19, mitigate its effects and impact to the community, and prevent serious disruption of the functioning of the government and the community.” The proclamation would also facilitate the implementation of mandatory reporting, intensify government response and measures, and enforce quarantine and disease control prevention measures. Duterte recognizes that the outbreak of Covid-19 constitutes an emergency that threatens national security which requires a “whole-of-government" response aligned with the Department of Health's (DOH) four-door framework for Covid-19, and the efforts of all concerned government agencies and LGUs. Under the proclamation, all government agencies and LGUs are tasked to give full assistance and cooperation and mobilize the necessary resources to undertake critical, urgent and appropriate response and measures in a timely manner to curtail and eliminate the Covid-19 threat. Health Secretary Francisco Duque III may seek the help of the Philippine National Police (PNP) and other law enforcement agencies to provide assistance in addressing the Covid-19 threat, the proclamation read. All citizens, residents, tourists, and establishment owners are urged to comply with these directives to prevent the transmission of Covid-19. The state of public health emergency will remain in force and effect until lifted by Duterte. Earlier, Presidential Spokesperson Salvador Panelo said Duterte will be releasing an executive order to strengthen public health response versus Covid-19. However, he clarified in a radio interview that instead of an executive order, Duterte will be issuing a proclamation. There are 10 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the country and 41 patients under investigation (PUI) who are currently admitted to hospitals. Of these confirmed cases, the first known local transmission of the virus is an elderly man who frequented an Islamic prayer hall at the Greenhills Mall. Some local governments and schools have called off classes to undergo disinfection protocols. In a Laging Handa press briefing in Malacañang, Duque said he respected the decision of local governments but stressed that he does not see a need to call for a lockdown in Metro Manila. As of March 8, 2020, there are a total of 105,586 cases of Covid-19 that has spread to 101 countries. DOH has placed the country under Covid-19 Alert System to Code Red sublevel 1 to prepare national and local governments and the country’s health care providers for possible increases in suspected and confirmed cases of the disease.

                            7. The learner and the learning context
An important issue in relation to the benefits of focused instruction is whether al1 learners can
equally benefit from it. Individual factors such as learner's age and cognitive characteristics, as
well as proficiency level can be seen to play a big role. As for age, while adult learners will be
able to draw on their cognitive resources to engage in explicit learning, young learners are less
likely to benefit from focus on form instruction that places too high cognitive demands on them.
Another important individual difference is the learner's (verbal) analytical abilities, which have
been found to be a good predictor of proficiency in both formal and informal settings (Harley
&amp; Hart, 1997; see also DeKeyser, 2003). Research has pointed out that learners with higher
levels of grammatical sensitivity (a component of language analytic ability) find it easier to
notice formal details of the L2 during second language acquisition (Ranta, 1998). Hence, Sawyer
and Ranta (2001) suggest that an important function of form-focused instruction may be to
compensate for learners' deficiencies in certain components of language aptitude, for example.
grammatical sensitivity.
Learners' proficiency level is also an important factor to take into consideration when
plaming focused instruction. Because research seems to show that beginning learners find it
difficult to focus on meaning and form at once (Celce-Murcia, 1991 ; Van Patten, 1990), the latter
may need to be applied with caution in the case of learners who have to struggle with basic
comprehension problems.
A not less important issue is the learning context. As Fotos (2002) argues, implicit
approaches to grammar instruction may be less appropriate in foreign language settings, where
class-time is limited and there is not enough externa1 communicative input to support continued
awareness, than in second language settings with abundant communicative input inside and
outside the classroom. In such contexts a combination of implicit and explicit approaches may
be more adequate. For example, this author (2002) proposes to incorporate implicit approaches
in lessons in which explicit instruction precedes communicative task performance. The
explanation aims at activating previously developed knowledge (Ausubel, Novak, &amp; Hanesian,
1978) and facilitating the establishment of form-meaning relationships. Provision of subsequent
communicative input containing the target structure is recommended to facilitate continued
awareness of its use in context.
It is to be noted, however, that purely communicative methodology has had only
marginal impact on foreign language teaching settings, where the dominant pedagogy continues
to involve a structural syllabus or, even, grammar translation (Skehan, 1998). In such contexts,
the recent emphasis on focus on form may mislead teachers into believing that their explicit
instructional practices and analytic syllabuses is al1 learners require. Hence, the need to
emphasize the necessity to incorporate form-focused activities in communicative contexts in the
foreign language class.

City High Enrollment hits 4, 387 online and modular students 
Programs for the new normal, beefed up
 By Aldrin S. Quila
 Tribune Post 
Nov. 2-8, 2020 issue 
Despite the pandemic, the school has formally recorded 2, 180 male students and 2, 207 female students comprising the 7% (302 students) of Online Distance Learning Modality (ODL) and 95% (4, 061 students) of Modular Distance Learning modality (MML). Secondary Principal III, Lina M. Laguras emphasized during an interview that the school is now ready for the new normal despite the situation that San Pablo is in. “Through careful crafting and implementing the Learning Continuity Plan (LCP) which serves as the springboard or map, we were able to successfully operate the school opening this year, Dr. Laguras said. Along with the celebration of Teachers’ day last October 5, San Pablo City International High School (SPCIHS) officially welcomed the close to 4, 500 online and offline students who enrolled this academic year 2020-2022. She also added that since the school offers both online and modular classes, its enrolees increased and some problems might be encountered. “Some of the problems we that are now facing is the over-crowded numbers of transferees since we open our school to a wider span as we follow the Education for All Law, but through the collaborative efforts of the Central and Regional Office of Department of Education (DepEd), Local Government Unit (LGU) and City Government of San Pablo led by City Governor Loreto “Amben” Amante, DepEd-San Pablo City spearheaded by Schools Division Superintendent Daisy Miranda Ed. D, teachers and those who support our school, we are trying our best to render good services and quality education for all,” the principal said. Meanwhile, she reminded everyone to spread Positivity and Hope instead of hates and rants; thus, to continue support the education amidst pandemic. On the other hand, Assistant Regional Director Ruth L. Fuentes visited the school last October 8 and inspected the facilities, enrollment, implementation of LCP, modules distributions as well as the preparedness of the school for the said new normal. Last September, the school conducted its face-to-face Parents’ Orientation and distributed modules to the parents while strictly following the safety protocols.</h2><br />

                            14. President Rodrigo Duterte has issued a proclamation formally declaring a state of public health emergency throughout the Philippines after the health department reported the first known local transmission of the new coronavirus disease (Covid-19). Duterte signed Proclamation 922 on March 8 to “capacitate government agencies and LGUs (local government units) to immediately act to prevent loss of life, utilize appropriate resources to implement urgent and critical measures to contain or prevent the spread of Covid-19, mitigate its effects and impact to the community, and prevent serious disruption of the functioning of the government and the community.” The proclamation would also facilitate the implementation of mandatory reporting, intensify government response and measures, and enforce quarantine and disease control prevention measures. State of Public Health Emergency Declared in PH by Azer Parrocha President Rodrigo Duterte has issued a proclamation formally declaring a state of public health emergency throughout the Philippines after the health department reported the first known local transmission of the new coronavirus disease (Covid-19). Duterte signed Proclamation 922 on March 8 to “capacitate government agencies and LGUs (local government units) to immediately act to prevent loss of life, utilize appropriate resources to implement urgent and critical measures to contain or prevent the spread of Covid-19, mitigate its effects and impact to the community, and prevent serious disruption of the functioning of the government and the community.” The proclamation would also facilitate the implementation of mandatory reporting, intensify government response and measures, and enforce quarantine and disease control prevention measures. Duterte recognizes that the outbreak of Covid-19 constitutes an emergency that threatens national security which requires a “whole-of-government" response aligned with the Department of Health's (DOH) four-door framework for Covid-19, and the efforts of all concerned government agencies and LGUs. Under the proclamation, all government agencies and LGUs are tasked to give full assistance and cooperation and mobilize the necessary resources to undertake critical, urgent and appropriate response and measures in a timely manner to curtail and eliminate the Covid-19 threat. Health Secretary Francisco Duque III may seek the help of the Philippine National Police (PNP) and other law enforcement agencies to provide assistance in addressing the Covid-19 threat, the proclamation read. All citizens, residents, tourists, and establishment owners are urged to comply with these directives to prevent the transmission of Covid-19. The state of public health emergency will remain in force and effect until lifted by Duterte. Earlier, Presidential Spokesperson Salvador Panelo said Duterte will be releasing an executive order to strengthen public health response versus Covid-19. However, he clarified in a radio interview that instead of an executive order, Duterte will be issuing a proclamation. There are 10 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the country and 41 patients under investigation (PUI) who are currently admitted to hospitals. Of these confirmed cases, the first known local transmission of the virus is an elderly man who frequented an Islamic prayer hall at the Greenhills Mall. Some local governments and schools have called off classes to undergo disinfection protocols. In a Laging Handa press briefing in Malacañang, Duque said he respected the decision of local governments but stressed that he does not see a need to call for a lockdown in Metro Manila. As of March 8, 2020, there are a total of 105,586 cases of Covid-19 that has spread to 101 countries. DOH has placed the country under Covid-19 Alert System to Code Red sublevel 1 to prepare national and local governments and the country’s health care providers for possible increases in suspected and confirmed cases of the disease.
