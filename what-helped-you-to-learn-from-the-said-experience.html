I learned that we should not rush things because we all have our timeline that sooner or later, we can achieve it. Lastly, let's always accept everything and every opportunity that will come, and let's all learn from our mistakes. It is also essential to appreciate our beauty, flaws, and imperfection and never compare ourselves to anybody. </p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>For more information, refer to these links:</strong></p><p>https://brainly.in/question/14681759</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/12958835</p><strong>#BrainlyEveryday</strong><br />
