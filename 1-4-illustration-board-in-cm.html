D. wave and particle 
3. The following are natural sources of light in the surroundings, EXCEPT__________ A. fire 
B. flashlight 
C. jellyfish 
D. lightning 
4. Which of the following are the correct reasons why we see a clear image of our face when we look on the mirror? 
I. A mirror has plane and smooth surface. 
II. Incident light rays to a mirror get diffracted when it strikes a mirror. III. Incident light rays to the mirror get refracted on the surface of mirror. IV. Incident light rays to a mirror get reflected when it strikes on plane surface.
A. I and II only 
B. I and III only 
C. I and IV only 
D. III and IV only 
5. According to Louis de Broglie, why is light said to have a dual nature? A. It shows the properties of wave only. 
B. It exhibits the properties of reflection. 
C. It has both interference and polarization effect. 
D. It displays the properties of both wave and particle. 
6. Who among the scientists below formulated the wave theory of light? A. Isaac Newton 
B. Louis de Broglie

7. Which of the following is NOT a property of light? 
A. Direction 
B. Frequency 
C. Intensity 
D. Width 
8. Which of the following materials would reflect light the most? 
A. black rock 
B. dark brown carpet 
C. flat sheet of aluminum foil 
D. piece of red construction paper 
9. The distance of an observer from two identical kinds of light sources varies. Light source A is 200 centimeters away while the light source B is 300 centimeters away from the observer. Does light source A give higher light intensity than light source B? 
A. Yes, because it is away from the observer 
B. Yes, because it is much closer to the observer 
C. No, because the distances of light source vary 
D. No, because its distance is closer from the observer 
10. The intensity of light is inversely proportional to the distance from the eye of the observer. Which of the following statements explain the relationship between intensity and distance? 
I. As the distance increases, the intensity of light decreases because it spreads out over a larger surface area. 
II. When the distance increases, the intensity of light increases because the light rays compressed in larger surface area. 
III. If the distance increases, the intensity of light decreases because light waves spread out more in its surrounding.
A. I, II, and III 
B. I and II only 
C. I and III only 
D. II and III only 
For items 11 to 13, refer to the illustration below. Suppose two identical kinds of light sources, A and B, shines on a surface of a board when placed 100 cm to the left and 50 cm to the right of the board, respectively. 
A B
100 cm 50 cm

11. Will the light intensity measured on the cardboard facing light source A is higher than the side facing light source B? 
A. No, because light source A is farther from the cardboard than light source B. B. Yes, because light source A is farther from the cardboard than light source B. C. Yes, because light source B is much closer to the cardboard than light source A. 
D. No, because the distance of light sources has no effect on their light intensities. 
12. How does the amount of light intensity of light source B compare to light source A as measured on the surface of the cardboard? 
A. They have equal light intensities. 
B. They have varying light intensities per time. 
C. The side facing light source A has greater light intensity. 
D. The side facing light source B has greater light intensity. 
13. Which of the following statements correctly describes the brightness of light sources A and B? 
I. Light source A is brighter than light source B. 
II. Light source B is brighter than light source A. 
III. Light sources A and B produce unequal brightness. 
IV. No differences in brightness between light sources A and B.
A. I, and II only 
B. II and III only 
C. III and IV only 
D. I, II, and III only 
14. Which of the following terms best describes an object that emit energy in the form of light? 
A. Fluorescence 
B. Incandescence 
C. Luminous 
D. Phosphorescence 
15. The following objects are luminous, EXCEPT__________________.

10. The intensity of light is inversely proportional to the distance from the eye of the observer. Which of the following statements explain the relationship between intensity and distance? 
I. As the distance increases, the intensity of light decreases because it spreads out over a larger surface area. 
II. When the distance increases, the intensity of light increases because the light rays compressed in larger surface area. 
III. If the distance increases, the intensity of light decreases because light waves spread out more in its surrounding.
A. I, II, and III 
B. I and II only 
C. I and III only

                        <strong>SET THEORY</strong><strong>Answers with Step-by-step explanation:</strong><p>
1.) M= {s, a, f, e), N = {s, e, a}, then N ⊆ M</p><p><strong>Answer: SUBSET</strong></p><p><strong>Explanation: </strong>A subset is a kind of set where all of its elements also belong in the universal set or another set. In the given above, notice that all of the elements in Set N can be seen in Set M, therefore that confirms the mathematical statement that <strong>Set N is a subset of Set M.</strong></p><p>
</p><p>2.) U = {x/x are numbers between 1 and 9), D = {2, 4, 6) then D' = {1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9}</p><p><strong>Answer: COMPLEMENT</strong></p><p><strong>Explanation: </strong> The complement of a set can be denoted by an apostrophe. This operation of set gets all the elements in the universal set that is not included in a particular set. In the given above, since the universal set consists of all numbers between 1 and 9 and it is also given that Set D is composed of 2, 4 and 6, hence, <strong>the complement of Set D must be composed of 1, 3, 5, 7, 8 and 9.</strong></p><p>
</p><p>3.) H=(2, 4, 6, 8) and K = (3, 6.9) then H∩K= {6}</p><p><strong>Answer: INTERSECTION</strong></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The intersection of sets is composed of the elements by which these sets have in common. In the given above, the common element for Set H and Set K is only 6. <strong>Therefore, the intersection of Set H and Set K is 6.</strong></p><p>
</p><p>4.) A= {x/x is a vowel letter in an English alphabet}, B= {x/x is a consonant letter in an English alphabet}, AUB = {x/x are letters in English alphabet}</p><p><strong>Answer: UNION</strong></p><p><strong>Explanation: </strong>The union of sets is one of the set operations which gives the combination of all elements in the two sets. If there are common elements, only one of their kind should be listed down or included. In the given above, since the sets are constructed in a set-builder notation, and Set A and B are vowels and consonants of the English alphabet, respectively, <strong>hence, their combination or union includes all letters in the English alphabet.</strong></p><p>
</p><p>5.) A = {2, 4, 6} and B = {4, 8} then A-B= {2, 6}</p><p><strong>Answer: DIFFERENCE</strong></p><p><strong>Explanation: </strong>The difference of sets can also be called the relative complement of sets. This results when you subtract or take away the elements of the set in the subtrahend (or the second quantity) from the set in the minuend (the first quantity). This means that you will be determining the intersection of the sets then you will take them away from the first given set. In the given above, <strong>since we have 2, 4 and 6 as elements of Set A while 4 and 8 as elements of Set B, and their common element is 4, we will take away 4 in the Set A so the result will be A-B = {2, 6}.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p>Learn more about union of sets:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/17910372</p><p></p><p><strong>#BRAINLYFAST</strong></p><br />
