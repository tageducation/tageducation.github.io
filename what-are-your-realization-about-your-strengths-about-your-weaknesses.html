                                            Give an example of a quote: Any quote is accepted except for rude ones.
Mine: "Sometimes you say that you are never wrong, but in reality, you are also never perfect, so don't hold something you know against another you never knew."
My 2nd Example: "Life is somehow pretty tough, but you know what keeps you stronger? the way you cry is how you show your pain to others, and if others think you are weak, they are too blind to see the closeness of your strength because crying doesn't make you weak, you've just stayed strong for a particular time, and you can continue to do all this for as much as long you can hold it for, so there's no need to compliment yourself inadequately, we are all equal and we're just humans, but there is a difference between us, it's about the habits we have and what we wave for when we want to show a different path between sins and forgiveness..."
My 3rd Example: "Sometimes words may hurt others, but don't let them hurt you, you should be the one giving them hope, the time you realize it's you making them experience to not give up."
My 4th Example: "Knowing is meticulous, but experiencing is even more considerable, it makes you realize perpetually."
My 5th Example: "Every story has to give the main character a problem to face and solve it. If he or she can't solve it, then there's no point in making a chronicle, if the story keeps going on without an end, then you're making a whole life history, there's no other way to keep going on, it's just between life and death."
You can give lots of examples!</a>

Mine: "Sometimes you say that you are never wrong, but in reality, you are also never perfect, so don't hold something you know against another you never knew."
My 2nd Example: "Life is somehow pretty tough, but you know what keeps you stronger? the way you cry is how you show your pain to others, and if others think you are weak, they are too blind to see the closeness of your strength because crying doesn't make you weak, you've just stayed strong for a particular time, and you can continue to do all this for as much as long you can hold it for, so there's no need to compliment yourself inadequately, we are all equal and we're just humans, but there is a difference between us, it's about the habits we have and what we wave for when we want to show a different path between sins and forgiveness..."
My 3rd Example: "Sometimes words may hurt others, but don't let them hurt you, you should be the one giving them hope, the time you realize it's you making them experience to not give up."
My 4th Example: "Knowing is meticulous, but experiencing is even more considerable, it makes you realize perpetually."
My 5th Example: "Every story has to give the main character a problem to face and solve it. If he or she can't solve it, then there's no point in making a chronicle, if the story keeps going on without an end, then you're making a whole life history, there's no other way to keep going on, it's just between life and death."

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Many of us have a wide range of experiences and achievements we want to have and reach during our lifetime. The final destinations always have a bright and shiny appeal about them but what we don’t often prepare for the twists, turns, and trials that can challenge us along the way. Here’s where knowing our strengths and weaknesses can be incredibly useful.</p><p></p><p>With a better idea of our resourcefulness and shortfalls, we aren’t only able to develop better plans to reach our goals, but we can also eliminate would-be challenges, experience a far more enjoyable journey as we progress toward our targets, and inevitably grow along the way.</p><p></p><p>The best way to identify your strengths and weaknesses involves a mix of methods. Some involve self-evaluation and others require a lending hand from others. By following these five steps, however, you’ll be eagerly embracing opportunities to increase your awareness of your strengths and weaknesses.</p><p></p><p>1. Identify Strengths and Weaknesses in Terms of Context</p><p>Firstly, forget drawing up a two-column table and listing your strengths on one side and weaknesses on the other without reference to a context. Doing so will be a completely pointless exercise. Without referencing your self-evaluation to a specific situation, you’re likely to wind up feeling overwhelmed and directionless.</p><p></p><p>According to researchers, strengths and weaknesses are highly contextual and dependent on the mix of our values, goals, interests, and situational factors.[1] Given this, it’s helpful to begin by reviewing key situations in your life where you have goals for things to be better than they are.</p><p></p><p>Certain aspects of your work might require you to exercise different skills and knowledge to varying degrees. You might be experiencing challenges in your personal or family relationships. Perhaps you want to master skills at playing a musical instrument, a sport, or develop a creative or performing arts talent.</p><p></p><p>Whichever you choose, get to task on the following:</p><p></p><p>Determine what skills, knowledge, and style of application will bring the desired outcomes and changes to fruition.</p><p>Review which of those you believe you have.</p><p>Rate how close a fit you believe what you have is a fit to what is required (e.g. 10 might be a perfect fit and zero represents no skills, knowledge, or application capability).</p><p>For ratings you ascribe yourself above zero, ask yourself how easy or challenging it is for you to apply the skills, knowledge, and understanding.</p><p>Ask yourself, “What did I enjoy the most?” and “What did I enjoy the least?”</p><p>It can also be more helpful and accurate to rate yourself along a continuum as opposed to trying to identify a trait, skill, or attribute as purely strength or weakness. You might be stronger in some regards and weaker/less strong in others.</p><p></p><p>You might also consider substituting ‘strengths’ and ‘weaknesses’ language for:</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>diko po alam #2 #CARRYONLEARING(●w●)<p></p><br />
