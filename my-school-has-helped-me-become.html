                                            The Taximan's Story by Catherine Lim(Story taken from Embracing our Heritage, Learning Module for English Grade Spp168-169) Very good, Madam. Sure, will take you there in plenty good time for your meeting, madam. This way better, less traffic, less car jams. Half hour shouldmake it, madam, so not to worry.2 What is it you say, madam? Yes, yes, ha, ha, been taxi man for twenty years now, madam. Long time ago. Singapore not like this so crowded so busy. Last time more peaceful, not so much taximen, or so much cars and buses.3 Yes madam, can make a living. So so. What to do. Must work hard if wants to success in Singapore. People like us, no education, no capital for business, we must sweat to earn money for wife and children.Yes, madam, quite big family--eight children, six sons, two daughters. Big family! Ha! Ha! No good, madam. In those days. Where got Family Planning in Singapore? People born many, many children, every year, one child. Is no good at all. Today is much better. Two children, three children, enough, stop. Our government say stop.5 Luck for me, all my children big now. Four of my sons working one a businessman, two clerks, one a teacher in Primary school, one in National Service, one still schooling, in Secondary Two. My eldest daughter, she is twenty plus, stay at home, help the mother. No, not married yet---Very shy and her health not so good, but a good, and obedient girl. My other girl Oh, Madam! Very hard for father when daughter is no good and go against her parents. Very sad like punishment from God. Today, young people not like us when we are young. We obey. Our parents say don't do this, we never do. Otherwise, the cane. My father cane me. I was big enough to be married, and still, got caning. My father he was very strict, and that is good thing for parents to be strict. If not, young boys and girls become very useless. Do not want to study, but run away, and go to night clubs and take drugs and make love. You agree with me madam?6 Today, young people they are very trouble to their parents. Madam, you see this young people over there, outside the coffee house? See what I mean, madam? They are only school boys and school girls, but they act like big shots,Quarter 2 Week 5pending money, smoking, wearing latest fashion, and making love. Ah, Madam, I know, I know! As taximan, I know them and their habits. Madam, you are a teacher, you say? You know or not that young school girls, fifteen, sixteen years old, they go to public lavatory or hotel and change into these clothes, and they put make-up on their face. Their parents never know. They tell their Mum got school meeting, got sports and games, this, that, but they really come out and play the fool.​</a>

                                            Summarize it.
The whole world has come to a standstill, and the reason is
the pandemic COVID-19. All of a sudden, it seems we are a
part of a horror movie. The villainous coronavirus is killing
thousands of people, and we are feeling helpless. It has
turned our lives upside down. Even in our dreams, we could
not have imagined ourselves conned to our homes, with no
outings and unable to meet our friends and relatives.
Reasonably, the situation has given us a chance to look at things dierently. In the beginning, this lockdown was considered as holidays by some children, like me. Once extended,
it has made us realize the value of attending schools. We appreciate the hard work of our
teachers who are trying their best to teach us through online classes and providing us with
study material. Teachers are not leaving any stone unturned so that we do not waste our
precious time sitting idle. Although initially taking online classes was a challenge for them,
they have quickly adapted so that our academic pathdoes not get aected. This has taught
us never to run away from challenges when life throws them upon us and, to try to adapt
according to the situation.
These hard times are teaching us the value of everyday food items like fruits, vegetables,
and groceries in our lives. They have become so valuable that nowadays they are not readily available. We are learning to manage ourselves with limited resources. We have learned
to respect our farmers and the vendors who are bringing these essentials to our doorsteps.
We have realized that we should never waste food because many people are unable to
have even a single meal during this lockdown period. It has also taught us life beyond junk
food as now we know that delicious food can be cooked at home too. We have become
more alert about personal hygiene and cleanliness.
The lockdown has also made us appreciate our parents, who usually work day and night to
fulll our reasonable (and unreasonable) demands and never complain. Spending more
time with them gave us an opportunity to understand them and to learn what quality time

is. Life is about not only studies, TV, and games. It is about sharing and standing with each
other during any phase of life. We have also got a chance to know about our parent’s childhood days, watching Ramayana, Mahabharata, etc. playing games like Ludo. Parents have
also taught us the value of money, and how necessary it is to save money for rainy days. We
have learnt that it is our moral duty to stand by our employees in oces and factories and
domestic help because they are the people who make our life worth living.
The current situation has made us value the organizations who keep working day and night
to make our life easy and smooth. We should be thankful to our government and police o-
cers who are trying to make people follow the rules of social distancing. We should also be
grateful to health workers who are putting their lives in danger to save thousands of lives.
Lockdown is giving us many lessons about life. We have learnt to handle diculties with a
positive mind, and I hope these lessons remain with us throughout life. There is an end to
every nightmare, and this one shall end soon.</a>

                                            The coronavirus started as much less of a real threat than it is now. I think it’s fair to say that most of the country was not worried about how it might affect us when we first heard about it. My life has been completely uprooted because of the virus. Maybe I can say that I am safe and lucky that my area has not become one of the most infected areas. Things are much different than they used to be. I definitely feel the panic from others as grocery stores sellout of things and the other businesses. I feel the panic from our leaders, who have put policy in place to hopefully end this virus in the near future. I think the reaction is appropriate and I appreciate everything that people are doing to help stop the spread, no matter how boring it may be.I can confidently say that my life has indeed changed. I am a junior high school, and this was not how I was planning to spend my junior year. Every day I wake up and “go” to online class. I do my modular activities and then workout. I eat at the times we normally would eat. My routine is extremely repetitive, and we will be doing this until become normal again. I understand that we may have to do this for a long time, and I am fully willing to do so in hopes that we can return to normal soon.I think the biggest challenge for me has been realizing that I might never go to my high school again to thank the teachers who changed my life and finally graduate after waiting four long years. It is hard that I must make a college decision in a time like this, but I also understand that there are many people out there who are not in the same position I am at the moment, so I am grateful for my opportunities and my blessings. However, I do feel that there is good in this situation. I believe that the future is uncertain going forward. I always ask myself if things will ever go back to what I consider “normal”. I hope that it will, and I hope that I will get the opportunity to do the things I want to do in my life. I think that there is something to be learned, but I just do not know what it is yet. I hope we can fight this together and come out stronger.asap need ko sagot now!! ​</a>

DepEd clarifies blended, distance learning modalities for SY 2020-2021 QUEZON CITY, July 3 (PIA) - The Department of Education (DepEd) clarifies blended and distance learning modality to be implemented this school year, as the agency prepares for a "new method of transmitting learning." In view of the recent information circulating online, DepEd is quick to clarify that online is not the only delivery modality of teaching and learning the department is devising. "Ang pag-aaral ngayong school year ay HINDI LAMANG gagawin online. Inihanda ng DepEd ang iba't ibang paraan ng pag-aaral na aakma sa lahat ng uri ng pamumuhay sa komunidad. Ang self-learning modules (SLM) ay ang pangunahing gagamitin sa pagtuturo," DepEd statement said. Although some parents have been worried for the continued education of their children amid pandemic, DepEd assured that different Education Learning Continuity Plan will be implemented depending on learners' access to technology and the situation they are in. "Some of the lessons will be transmitted through different platforms and some activities will be done at home," Education Secretary Leonor Magtolis Briones said in a virtual press briefing. To avoid face-to-face interactions, DepEd offers blended and distance learning modalities by using printed or digital modules, online learning resources, and radio and TV-based instructions. Distance learning refers to a learning delivery modality where leaming takes place between the teacher and the learners who are geographically remote from each other during instruction.It has three learning modalities: (1) modular distance learning uses self-learning modules that are printed or in digital format; (2) online distance learning uses the Internet in downloading learning materials and uploading homeworks; and (3) Radio/TV based instructions to those who have no Internet connectivity. Meanwhile, blended learning refers to a mix of online distance learning, modular distance learning, and TV/Radio-based Instruction. Homeschooling option is learning in a home-based environment to be facilitated by qualified parents, guardians or tutors who have undergone relevant training. "We need to prepare not only the schools, learners, administrators, and teaching and non-teaching personnel, but also the parents and guardians of the learners," Briones said. These alternative learning methods depend "very heavily on parents and community support to make its Basic Education Learning Continuity Plan (BE-LCP) successful. "Education becomes more and more a shared activity, and we ask the parents and the community and experts and to join us on our effort," Briones said (MTQ/PIA-IDPD).Can this article be considered credible?

Write ✓ if the paragraphis well-written that is employing the properties of a well-written text, andwrite x if otherwise.1. My family and I live in a small apartment. It has two bedrooms and amulti-purpose living room that serves as our dining room, play room,study room, etc. It has a small vegetable garden in front. Although I lovegardening but since I'm busy with my work, I did a little part in growing it.I also had trouble when I lost my laptop. I only have one sister so, I thinkthe apartment is just enough for us. But when our friends and relativespay a visit, it becomes too crowded but it is also fun.2. I grew up with my grandmother who took care of me, loved meunconditionally, sent me to school and taught me right manners. Myparents got separated and both of them later remarried and had their ownfamily too. With my grandmother's support, I was able to finish my studiesand earned a degree. I was lucky enough to land for a permanent job rightafter my graduation in college. I got promoted to a higher position after ayear. Now, I am enjoying the fruit of my labor. I bought a house for mygrandmother and I am also giving support to siblings both in my mother'sand father's side.3. Doing something good in life gives a queer feeling of joy and satisfaction.These are my simple ways of manifesting it. First, I bear in mind thatdoing good to others will also make me a better person. Next, I develop asense of empathy-that is putting myself on the shoe of the person I intendto help. Then, I try to imagine their impression of me after giving them ahelping hand. Lastly, I extend help to the needy to the best possible way Ican, but I do it secretly. This is my way of showing my appreciation toHim- to the good life that He blessed me. Doing something good in life islikewise doing something pleasing to the eyes of our creator-our God.4. Men in nature have endless needs and wants in life. For example, if theydesire to have a cellphone today, tomorrow they will seek for somethingbetter. It might be more expensive, more elegant, upgraded or updated.Also, if they dream to have a house today, after achieving it here comesanother, like wanting a car. Indeed, wants of men levels up and changesas time goes by. They never stop, they never lessen, rather they keep ongrowing​</a>

                            13. Summarize it.
The whole world has come to a standstill, and the reason is
the pandemic COVID-19. All of a sudden, it seems we are a
part of a horror movie. The villainous coronavirus is killing
thousands of people, and we are feeling helpless. It has
turned our lives upside down. Even in our dreams, we could
not have imagined ourselves conned to our homes, with no
outings and unable to meet our friends and relatives.
Reasonably, the situation has given us a chance to look at things dierently. In the beginning, this lockdown was considered as holidays by some children, like me. Once extended,
it has made us realize the value of attending schools. We appreciate the hard work of our
teachers who are trying their best to teach us through online classes and providing us with
study material. Teachers are not leaving any stone unturned so that we do not waste our
precious time sitting idle. Although initially taking online classes was a challenge for them,
they have quickly adapted so that our academic pathdoes not get aected. This has taught
us never to run away from challenges when life throws them upon us and, to try to adapt
according to the situation.
These hard times are teaching us the value of everyday food items like fruits, vegetables,
and groceries in our lives. They have become so valuable that nowadays they are not readily available. We are learning to manage ourselves with limited resources. We have learned
to respect our farmers and the vendors who are bringing these essentials to our doorsteps.
We have realized that we should never waste food because many people are unable to
have even a single meal during this lockdown period. It has also taught us life beyond junk
food as now we know that delicious food can be cooked at home too. We have become
more alert about personal hygiene and cleanliness.
The lockdown has also made us appreciate our parents, who usually work day and night to
fulll our reasonable (and unreasonable) demands and never complain. Spending more
time with them gave us an opportunity to understand them and to learn what quality time

Parents and My Teachers
is. Life is about not only studies, TV, and games. It is about sharing and standing with each
other during any phase of life. We have also got a chance to know about our parent’s childhood days, watching Ramayana, Mahabharata, etc. playing games like Ludo. Parents have
also taught us the value of money, and how necessary it is to save money for rainy days. We
have learnt that it is our moral duty to stand by our employees in oces and factories and
domestic help because they are the people who make our life worth living.
The current situation has made us value the organizations who keep working day and night
to make our life easy and smooth. We should be thankful to our government and police o-
cers who are trying to make people follow the rules of social distancing. We should also be
grateful to health workers who are putting their lives in danger to save thousands of lives.
Lockdown is giving us many lessons about life. We have learnt to handle diculties with a
positive mind, and I hope these lessons remain with us throughout life. There is an end to
every nightmare, and this one shall end soon.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Covid-19 Shocked the entire world due to its sudden appearance, it caused chaos and panic among-st nations and governments. 2 years ago non of us imagined that we would be stuck in our homes in lock down yet here we are. It did massive economy damages in all countries and caused major problems and inconvenience to people. However and shined a light on a different point of view. It made us realize the the world is finite, our resources are not limitless and that we should learn and educate ourselves to respect those who work day and night to provide food and water for our nations. We should also thank those who constantly put their selves into danger and sacrifice their lives to find a cure to the current pandemic especially the doctors and front liners. Another thing the lock down taught us is that everything is temporary, Nothing stays the same for long  but when it changes doesn't mean it's gone. The lives that were lost during the pandemic were not in vain, and their legacy and memory will live on. Yes death is inevitable but we shouldn't dwell on what's to come but instead live in the moment and create memories as we go, cherish our loved ones because we will never what the future holds.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Hope it helps &lt;3</p><br />

                            15. The coronavirus started as much less of a real threat than it is now. I think it’s fair to say that most of the country was not worried about how it might affect us when we first heard about it. My life has been completely uprooted because of the virus. Maybe I can say that I am safe and lucky that my area has not become one of the most infected areas. Things are much different than they used to be. I definitely feel the panic from others as grocery stores sellout of things and the other businesses. I feel the panic from our leaders, who have put policy in place to hopefully end this virus in the near future. I think the reaction is appropriate and I appreciate everything that people are doing to help stop the spread, no matter how boring it may be.I can confidently say that my life has indeed changed. I am a junior high school, and this was not how I was planning to spend my junior year. Every day I wake up and “go” to online class. I do my modular activities and then workout. I eat at the times we normally would eat. My routine is extremely repetitive, and we will be doing this until become normal again. I understand that we may have to do this for a long time, and I am fully willing to do so in hopes that we can return to normal soon.I think the biggest challenge for me has been realizing that I might never go to my high school again to thank the teachers who changed my life and finally graduate after waiting four long years. It is hard that I must make a college decision in a time like this, but I also understand that there are many people out there who are not in the same position I am at the moment, so I am grateful for my opportunities and my blessings. However, I do feel that there is good in this situation. I believe that the future is uncertain going forward. I always ask myself if things will ever go back to what I consider “normal”. I hope that it will, and I hope that I will get the opportunity to do the things I want to do in my life. I think that there is something to be learned, but I just do not know what it is yet. I hope we can fight this together and come out stronger.asap need ko sagot now!! ​</h2><br />

I think it’s fair to say that most of the country was not worried about how it might affect us when we first heard about it. My life has been completely uprooted because of the virus. Because of the slow internet here remote learning has become nearly impossible to do effectively.

                            16. Assess the credibility of the article below using the checklist. DepEd clarifies blended, distance learning modalities for SY 2020-2021 QUEZON CITY, July 3 (PIA) - The Department of Education (DepEd) clarifies blended and distance learning modality to be implemented this school year, as the agency prepares for a "new method of transmitting learning." In view of the recent information circulating online, DepEd is quick to clarify that online is not the only delivery modality of teaching and learning the department is devising. "Ang pag-aaral ngayong school year ay HINDI LAMANG gagawin online. Inihanda ng DepEd ang iba't ibang paraan ng pag-aaral na aakma sa lahat ng uri ng pamumuhay sa komunidad. Ang self-learning modules (SLM) ay ang pangunahing gagamitin sa pagtuturo," DepEd statement said. Although some parents have been worried for the continued education of their children amid pandemic, DepEd assured that different Education Learning Continuity Plan will be implemented depending on learners' access to technology and the situation they are in. "Some of the lessons will be transmitted through different platforms and some activities will be done at home," Education Secretary Leonor Magtolis Briones said in a virtual press briefing. To avoid face-to-face interactions, DepEd offers blended and distance learning modalities by using printed or digital modules, online learning resources, and radio and TV-based instructions. Distance learning refers to a learning delivery modality where leaming takes place between the teacher and the learners who are geographically remote from each other during instruction.It has three learning modalities: (1) modular distance learning uses self-learning modules that are printed or in digital format; (2) online distance learning uses the Internet in downloading learning materials and uploading homeworks; and (3) Radio/TV based instructions to those who have no Internet connectivity. Meanwhile, blended learning refers to a mix of online distance learning, modular distance learning, and TV/Radio-based Instruction. Homeschooling option is learning in a home-based environment to be facilitated by qualified parents, guardians or tutors who have undergone relevant training. "We need to prepare not only the schools, learners, administrators, and teaching and non-teaching personnel, but also the parents and guardians of the learners," Briones said. These alternative learning methods depend "very heavily on parents and community support to make its Basic Education Learning Continuity Plan (BE-LCP) successful. "Education becomes more and more a shared activity, and we ask the parents and the community and experts and to join us on our effort," Briones said (MTQ/PIA-IDPD).Can this article be considered credible?

                            21. Read and understand the paragraphs below. Write ✓ if the paragraphis well-written that is employing the properties of a well-written text, andwrite x if otherwise.1. My family and I live in a small apartment. It has two bedrooms and amulti-purpose living room that serves as our dining room, play room,study room, etc. It has a small vegetable garden in front. Although I lovegardening but since I'm busy with my work, I did a little part in growing it.I also had trouble when I lost my laptop. I only have one sister so, I thinkthe apartment is just enough for us. But when our friends and relativespay a visit, it becomes too crowded but it is also fun.2. I grew up with my grandmother who took care of me, loved meunconditionally, sent me to school and taught me right manners. Myparents got separated and both of them later remarried and had their ownfamily too. With my grandmother's support, I was able to finish my studiesand earned a degree. I was lucky enough to land for a permanent job rightafter my graduation in college. I got promoted to a higher position after ayear. Now, I am enjoying the fruit of my labor. I bought a house for mygrandmother and I am also giving support to siblings both in my mother'sand father's side.3. Doing something good in life gives a queer feeling of joy and satisfaction.These are my simple ways of manifesting it. First, I bear in mind thatdoing good to others will also make me a better person. Next, I develop asense of empathy-that is putting myself on the shoe of the person I intendto help. Then, I try to imagine their impression of me after giving them ahelping hand. Lastly, I extend help to the needy to the best possible way Ican, but I do it secretly. This is my way of showing my appreciation toHim- to the good life that He blessed me. Doing something good in life islikewise doing something pleasing to the eyes of our creator-our God.4. Men in nature have endless needs and wants in life. For example, if theydesire to have a cellphone today, tomorrow they will seek for somethingbetter. It might be more expensive, more elegant, upgraded or updated.Also, if they dream to have a house today, after achieving it here comesanother, like wanting a car. Indeed, wants of men levels up and changesas time goes by. They never stop, they never lessen, rather they keep ongrowing​</h2><br />

                            22. JORDANIAN PLATFORM HELPS IDEAS OF YOUNG INVENTORS, INNOVATORS BECOME REALITYMY REFLECTION: 'I believe', 'I think', 'In my opinion', 'My first reaction was', 'I was especially moved by', 'The author was successful in making me feel',JORDANIAN PLATFORM HELPS IDEAS OF YOUNG INVENTORS, INNOVATORS BECOME REALITYPhilippine Daily Inquirer7 Mar 2022the age of COVID-19, Jordanian mechanical engineer Saliba Taimeh pondered how to deal with one contaminated everyday surface: the handrails of escalators in shopping malls and transport hubs.He came up with a device to sterilize them with ultraviolet rays—and this is where TechWorks stepped in.A wealth of ideas would not have seen the light of day without TechWorks, a Jordanian platform aimed at bringing together youth, ideas and resources to jump-start innovations.Set up in 2018, TechWorks says its mission is “to plug into entrepreneurial and innovation ecosystems” and turn ideas into reality.It is equipped with stateof-the-art technology such as three-dimensional (3D) printers and affiliated with a foundation set up by Crown Prince of Jordan Hussein bin Abdullah.Last year, it attracted about 100 inventors and start-up companies, enabling them to produce prototypes quickly and at low cost.Taimeh, 39, said TechWorks “provided me with every support, back up, advice and guidance” to help perfect the sterilizing device, after 23 attempts over almost two years.German investorHis invention sterilises the handrails of escalators “from all kinds of viruses, such as coronavirus and bacteria,” he said.After contacting several international companies, a German firm specializing in health and safety in public places signed up to manufacture the “Brigid Box.”Weighing in at 7.2 kilograms (almost 16 pounds), it can be installed in less than 15 minutes.Taimeh’s success story is only one of many.High school student Zain Abu Rumman, 18, has developed a tracking device for elderly patients and people with special needs, worn like a watch or around the neck.The “SPS Watch” has a battery that lasts eight days and is resistant to water, heat and breakage.“The device can send alerts to the mobile phone of a family member through a special application in case the person wearing it falls or is hurt, or if he strays from a certain place,” Abu Rumman said.It took him two-and-a-half years to perfect and he has struck a production accord with a Chinese company.Omar Khader, 26, works for “Jazri Studio,” an industrial design company which has devised a “smart” plug to protect children from electric shocks.“TechWorks has advanced equipment, engineers and technicians that help us convert our ideas into successful products,” he said.Other designers, like 32-yearold civil engineer Malik Nour, still have a long and expensive way to go to refine their products.Nour’s brainchild is the “Pikler Triangle,” designed as a safe and environmentally friendly children’s toy.He hopes to attract Swedish furniture giant IKEA to take on his products, which he is already selling over social media to customers in Jordan, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates under the label of “Fares World,” named after his child..Creative environmentIsmail Hakki, executive director of TechWorks, said its aim is to provide “a creative environment and all the necessary resources to support and enable young people to transform their projects from a mere idea into a real product.”The doors of the project’s “Fabrication Lab,” or FabLab, are “open to all; we support students, entrepreneurs, and startups,” he said.FabLab also provides services to doctors and hospitals in the fields of facial restoration, digital dentistry, face masks and sterilization.At the request of a doctor, it transformed the chest x-ray of a patient with a malignant tumor close to the heart into a 3D model of the patient’s chest making it easier to operate.FabLab touts many successes, including a “smart home” which allows a mobile phone user to control electrical appliances inside the house from afar by turning on heating or cooling systems and a piano keyboard to help a blind musician play.It plans to open two more branches in Jordan to provide technology training and help for school and university students.​</h2><br />
