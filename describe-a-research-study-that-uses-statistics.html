It is descriptive in a sense that the data obtained was analyzed and describe. Specifically use the phenomenological type that describes the actual experiences of the women diagnosed with breast cancer.The researchers used an interview guide questionnaire as instrument. Based on the result of the survey tool conducted, researcher was able to determine the details of experiences of women with breast cancer.1. Guide Questions:a. What design did you choose?b. Describe the design and relate the use of which in your particular study. c. Which specific type of the research design is being used in your study?d. Why did you choose such type?​</a>

                                            Put a check if it describes the characteristics of a Quantitative Research.1. Data is the form of words, pictures or objects.2. The data is usually gathered using structured research instruments.3. It's not based upon numerical measurements and does not use number and statistical method as key research indicators and tools.4. It tends to be associated with small-scale studies and holistic perspective, often studying a single occurrence or small number of occurrences/case studies in great depth.5. The research study can usually be replicated or repeated, given it's high reliability.6. Data are in the form of numbers and statistic, often arranged in tables, charts, figures, or other non-textual forms.7. Emphasis is on discovery rather than proof. 8. The results are based on larger sample sizes which represent the population.9. It tends to be associated with emergent research design, using a wide range of approaches.10. Researcher has a clearly defined research question to which objective answers are sought.I'll put brainliest to those who answer.

It is descriptive in a sense that the data obtained was analyzed and describe. Specifically use the phenomenological type that describes the actual experiences of the women diagnosed with breast cancer.The researchers used an interview guide questionnaire as instrument. Based on the result of the survey tool conducted, researcher was able to determine the details of experiences of women with breast cancer.1. Guide Questions:a. What design did you choose?b.
