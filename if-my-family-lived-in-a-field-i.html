Do this in your notebook. two-hectare "I was born a poor man, the son of a school teacher in one of the smallest towns in the Philippines Baler. My father had, besides his salary, a rice land which he cultivated. While i was a boy and during my early youth, my father saved as much as he could from his meager salary and from what he could get from his rice-field, only to have a few hundred pesos with which to give me an education. During those Spanish days, a Filipino family could live in a small town on four pesos a month and a supply of rice. Thus, did my family live for years. When I was at the age of five, an aunt of mine started to teach me to read and write. My own father and mother, and the priest of the town later gave me my primary instruction. At the age of nine, I was brought by my father to Manila and began my secondary education at the San Juan de Letran College. First, I lived in the Convent of San Francisco serving as a room and mess boy for one priest, receiving no salary, except board and room. Then, my father moved me to the house of an aunt where for some pesos, 1 roomed and boarded. The house was located in Paco, too far from the Walled City for him who could only use his own fee as a means of transportation. My classes started at seven o'clock in the morning and I had to eat and the early to reach my classes on time again, this impaired my health, and the following year, I was taken by my father to San Juan de Letran as an intern. I remained as an intern until I graduated as A. B. with the highest honors. By this time, the savings of my father had all been spent on my education. He owed money, and simply told me that I had to stop my studies unless I could work my way through university education. I came to Manila and spoke to my Dominican professors, who, by this time, had become very fond of me, and told them of my situation. I wanted to be a lawyer, but could not pay for my expenses. They secured a position for me as one of the helpers in the University of Santo Tomas with room and board and free tuition. Thus, I was able to take up the study of law. 1.

Do this in your notebook.MANUEL QUEZON "I was born a poor man, the son of a school teacher in one of the smallest towns in the Philippines–Baler. My father had, besides his salary, a two-hectare rice-land which he cultivated. While I was a boy and during my early youth, my father saved as much as he could from his meager salary and from what he could get from his rice-field, only to have a few hundred pesos with which to give me an education. During those Spanish days, a Filipino family could live in a small town on four pesos a month and a supply of rice. Thus, did my family live for years. When I was at the age of five, an aunt of mine started to teach me to read and write. My own father and mother, and the priest of the town later gave me my primary instruction. At the age of nine, I was brought by my father to Manila and began my secondary education at the San Juan de Letran College. First, I lived in the Convent of San Francisco serving as a room-and-mess boy for one priest, receiving no salary, except board and room. Then, my father moved me to the house of an aunt where for some pesos, I roomed and boarded. The house was located in Paco, too far from the Walled City for him who could only use his own feet as a means of transportation. My classes started at seven o'clock in the morning and I had to get up very early to reach my classes on time. Again, this impaired my health, and the following year, I was taken by my father to San Juan de Letran as an intern. I remained as an intern until I graduated as A.B. with the highest honors. By this time, the savings of my father had all been spent on my education. He owed money, and simply told me that I had to stop my studies unless I could work my way through university education. I came to Manila and spoke to my Dominican professors, who, by this time, had become very fond of me, and told them of my situation. I wanted to be a lawyer, but could not pay for my expenses. They secured a position for me as one of the helpers in the University of Santo Tomas with room and board and free tuition. Thus, I was able to take up the study of law.''1.

My father had, besides his salary, a rice land which he cultivated. While i was a boy and during my early youth, my father saved as much as he could from his meager salary and from what he could get from his rice-field, only to have a few hundred pesos with which to give me an education. During those Spanish days, a Filipino family could live in a small town on four pesos a month and a supply of rice. Thus, did my family live for years. When I was at the age of five, an aunt of mine started to teach me to read and write. My own father and mother, and the priest of the town later gave me my primary instruction. At the age of nine, I was brought by my father to Manila and began my secondary education at the San Juan de Letran College. First, I lived in the Convent of San Francisco serving as a room and mess boy for one priest, receiving no salary, except board and room. Then, my father moved me to the house of an aunt where for some pesos, 1 roomed and boarded. The house was located in Paco, too far from the Walled City for him who could only use his own fee as a means of transportation. My classes started at seven o'clock in the morning and I had to eat and the early to reach my classes on time again, this impaired my health, and the following year, I was taken by my father to San Juan de Letran as an intern. I remained as an intern until I graduated as A. B. with the highest honors. By this time, the savings of my father had all been spent on my education. He owed money, and simply told me that I had to stop my studies unless I could work my way through university education. I came to Manila and spoke to my Dominican professors, who, by this time, had become very fond of me, and told them of my situation. I wanted to be a lawyer, but could not pay for my expenses. They secured a position for me as one of the helpers in the University of Santo Tomas with room and board and free tuition. Thus, I was able to take up the study of law. 1.

Do this in your notebook.MANUEL QUEZON "I was born a poor man, the son of a school teacher in one of the smallest towns in the Philippines–Baler. My father had, besides his salary, a two-hectare rice-land which he cultivated. While I was a boy and during my early youth, my father saved as much as he could from his meager salary and from what he could get from his rice-field, only to have a few hundred pesos with which to give me an education. During those Spanish days, a Filipino family could live in a small town on four pesos a month and a supply of rice. Thus, did my family live for years.

Are you inspired by his journey in the pursuit of his dream?2. What do you think was his purpose in sharing this part of his life to his audience?3. How did his story affect your personal views about your studies and your dreams?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>1.  President Manuel L. Quezon <strong>can indeed inspired anyone to pursue his/her dreams no matter how difficult their situation could get</strong>.  Compared to his time, we have more opportunities to live a better, more fulfilled life since we live in a freer society.  Moreover, his example as public servant can also inspired people to pay it forward and do what they can to help others.</p><p>2.  For sure, <strong>he wants to inspire the youth of his time to dream big and do what they can to chase their dreams</strong>.  From a simple family that lives on a meager four-peso monthly income, he has come a long way to becoming a leader of the republic.  His fine example has outlived many generations  and continues to inspire people at this time. <strong>He also probably wants to encourage the people to help one another </strong>which is important in uplifting their lives.</p><p>3. It can make young people <strong>rethink how important it is that to value every opportunity that they are handed right now</strong>.  It may be in the form of education which not everyone gets to have.  They better start focusing on things that matter to to them as a student, and make sure they are doing their best.  </p><p>#BRAINLYEVERYDAY</p><br />

                            30. "I was born a poor man, the son of a school teacherin one of the smallest towns in the Philippines--Baler.My father had, besides his salary, a two-hectarerice-land which he cultivated. While I was a boy andduring my early youth, my father saved as much as hecould from his meager salary and from what he couldget from his rice-field, only to have a few hundred pesoswith which to give me an education. During thoseSpanish days, a Filipino family could live in a smalltown on four pesos a month and a supply of rice. Thus,did my family live for years. When I was at the age offive, an aunt of mine started to teach me to read and write. My own fatherand mother, and the priest of the town later gave me my primaryinstruction. At the age of nine, I was brought by my father to Manila andbegan my secondary education at the San Juan de Letran College. First, Ilived in the Convent of San Francisco serving as a room-and-mess boy forone priest, receiving no salary, except board and room. Then, my fathermoved me to the house of an aunt where for some pesos, I roomed andboarded. The house was located in Paco, too far from the Walled City forhim who could only use his own feet as a means of transportation. Myclasses started at seven o'clock in the morning and I had to get up veryearly to reach my classes on time. Again, this impaired my health, and thefollowing year, I was taken by my father to San Juan de Letran as anintern. I remained as an intern until I graduated as A.B. with the highesthonors. By this time, the savings of my father had all been spent on myeducation. He owed money, and simply told me that I had to stop mystudies unless I could work my way through university education. I cameto Manila and spoke to my Dominican professors, who, by this time, hadbecome very fond of me, and told them of my situation. I wanted to be alawyer, but could not pay for my expenses. They secured a position for meas one of the helpers in the University of Santo Tomas with room and boardand free tuition. Thus, I was able to take up the study of law.”1.
