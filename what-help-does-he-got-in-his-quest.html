</p><p>
</p><p><strong>2.	What adventure does Polydectes suggest that Perseus undertake?
</strong></p><p>King Polydectes, who wanted Danae to become his wife, gave <strong>Perseus </strong>a dangerous mission. Knowing that he would not be able to get Danae for himself as long as <strong>Perseus </strong>was there to protect her, the king made a plan to send Perseus not only far away but also to a risky task. Polydectes told <strong>Perseus </strong>to kill Medusa and to prove it by handing him over its head.  </p><p>
</p><p><strong>3.	List three perilous encounters that Perseus experienced during his
</strong></p><p><strong>adventure</strong>.
</p><strong>Perseus</strong>’ encounter with Graeae- The Graeae were three old sisters, who shared a single eye between them. The Graeae did not initially want to help <strong>Perseus</strong>, but he managed to steal their eye. Perseus refused to give back the eye until they agreed to help him.  <strong>Perseus</strong>’ encounter with the Nymphs- The Graeae told <strong>Perseus </strong>about the nymphs and where to find them. When <strong>Perseus </strong>found them, they significantly assisted him with three important gifts:  winged sandals, which would allow him to fly through the air;  a cap of darkness, which would make him invisible;  and a special metallic pouch for Medusa’s head.
<p>3. <strong>Perseus</strong>’ encounter with the Sea Monster- As <strong>Perseus </strong>was flying home on his winged sandals, <strong>Perseus </strong>passed by Ethiopia and he saw a beautiful girl, Andromeda, who was the princess of the land, chained to a rocky cliff and about to be devoured by a sea monster. <strong>Perseus </strong>immediately fell in love with her. Using his sword and winged sandals, <strong>Perseus </strong>killed the monster to stone by showing it Medusa’s head.
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>4.	Explain how the oracle given to King Acrisius is fulfilled.
</strong></p><p><strong>Perseus </strong>decided to went back to his mother’s homeland to make peace with his Grandfather Acrisius. When he was competing at an athletic competition, <strong>Perseus </strong>threw a discus and he accidentally hit an old man, not knowing that it was his grandfather Acrisius. The incident killed Acrisius instantly
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>5.  What is Polydectes’ true motive in sending Perseus to kill Medusa?
</strong></p><p>Polydectes intended to rid of <strong>Perseus </strong>so he can marry his mother Danae. He intentionally sent <strong>Perseus </strong>to a deadly mission hoping he would never be able to go back and protect his mother
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>6.	Medusa was beheaded by Perseus, yet her head continued to have power. Explain how the evil Gorgon’s head is beneficial to Perseus.
