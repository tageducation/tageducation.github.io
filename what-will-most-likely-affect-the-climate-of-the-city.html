Areas that are close to Oceans and other large bodowater tend to have more moderate climate ranges between seasonsTopography is the natural features or arrangement of an area like land. The windward side of mostranges tends to receive more precipitation than the leoward sidePrevailing winds or wind direction influences regional climate including how much precipitation coursin relation to mountain ranges and water bodies.Ocean currents. Currents tend to warm temperatures of eastern coastal areas and cool temperatureson the west coast of continents. Ocean currents are similar to winds in the atmosphere. They transfer significantamounts of heat from Earth's equatorial areas to the poles and thus play important roles in determining theclimates of coastal regions.EXAMPLE: Latitude is one of the factors that affects climateActivity 1: "Weather vs. Climate"Direction: For each statement below, write "W" if you think the statement relates to Weather or "C" if youhink the statement relates to Climate.

                                            ACTIVITY 2: Identify as to which factor affecting climate the following statement explains.
1. The side of a mountain near water (WINDWARD SIDE) gets more rainfall, and the side away (LEEWARD) is
drier.
2. Wind patterns move heat and moisture around Earth, which can change the temperature and rainfall in a
place.
3. In Kilimanjaro, the climate gets colder the higher up you go, so at the top, it could be snowing, while at the
bottom, it is hot because of the sun’s direct rays at the equator.
4. It refers to features of the land, like mountains and hills, and valleys and low points.
5. Warm air thus moves out from land to sea, slowing down the rise of air temperature above land.
6. When an area is farther from the equator, the air temperature is lower. If it is closer to the equator, the
temperature is higher.
7. This tends to increase the temperatures of eastern coastal areas and decrease the temperatures of western
coastal areas.
8. Features like mountains cause some places to get more rainfall, and some areas to be drier.
9. Elevation refers to how high above sea level a location is.
ASSESSMENT: Write the letter of the correct answer.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Large bodies of water, such as oceans, seas and large lakes, can affect the climate of an area. Water heats and cools more slowly than landmasses. Therefore, the coastal regions will stay cooler in summer and warmer in winter, thus creating a more moderate climate with a narrower temperature range.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>I hope it helps to you keep learning.</p><br />

                            23. ACTIVITY 2: Identify as to which factor affecting climate the following statement explains.
1. The side of a mountain near water (WINDWARD SIDE) gets more rainfall, and the side away (LEEWARD) is
drier.
2. Wind patterns move heat and moisture around Earth, which can change the temperature and rainfall in a
place.
3. In Kilimanjaro, the climate gets colder the higher up you go, so at the top, it could be snowing, while at the
bottom, it is hot because of the sun’s direct rays at the equator.
4. It refers to features of the land, like mountains and hills, and valleys and low points.
5. Warm air thus moves out from land to sea, slowing down the rise of air temperature above land.
6. When an area is farther from the equator, the air temperature is lower. If it is closer to the equator, the
temperature is higher.
7. This tends to increase the temperatures of eastern coastal areas and decrease the temperatures of western
coastal areas.
8. Features like mountains cause some places to get more rainfall, and some areas to be drier.
9. Elevation refers to how high above sea level a location is.
ASSESSMENT: Write the letter of the correct answer.
