                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>CHAPTER 5. PUTTING THE PIECES TOGETHER WITH A THESIS STATEMENT
</p><p>5.1 APPLY PREWRITING MODELS
</p><p>Learning Objectives
</p><p>Use prewriting strategies to choose a topic and narrow the focus
</p><p>  </p><p>
</p><p>If you think that a blank sheet of paper or a blinking cursor on the computer screen is a scary sight, you are not alone. Many writers, students, and employees find that beginning to write can be intimidating. When faced with a blank page, however, experienced writers remind themselves that writing, like other everyday activities, is a process. Every process, from writing to cooking to bike riding to learning to use a new cell phone will get significantly easier with practice.
</p><p>
</p><p>Just as you need a recipe, ingredients, and proper tools to cook a delicious meal, you also need a plan, resources, and adequate time to create a good written composition. In other words, writing is a process that requires steps and strategies to accomplish your goals.
</p><p>
</p><p>These are the five steps in the writing process:
</p><p>
</p><p>Prewriting
</p><p>Outlining the structure of ideas
</p><p>Writing a rough draft
</p><p>Revising
</p><p>Editing
</p><p>Effective writing can be simply described as good ideas that are expressed well and arranged in the proper order. This chapter will give you the chance to work on all these important aspects of writing. Although many more prewriting strategies exist, this chapter covers six: using experience and observations, freewriting, asking questions, brainstorming, mapping, and searching the Internet. Using the strategies in this chapter can help you overcome the fear of the blank page and confidently begin the writing process.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

I never became great friends with Karen, but after that, it seemed like all sorts of people started becoming my friend. You cannot convince me that Karen did not know what she was doing. I have a great respect for her and I learned a lot about what a true leader is. What pattern of paragraph development is used in this example? *1 pointA. NarrativeB. Process.C. DescriptiveD.
