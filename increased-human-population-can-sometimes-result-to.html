                                            Estuaries are important parts of our lives. They are also important parts of our 
coastal and ocean ecosystems. Estuaries provide rich feeding grounds for coastal 
fish and migratory birds and drowning areas for fish and shellfish. It is important that 
everyone helps to protect estuaries and conserve the valuable resources in the estuaries 
ecosystem.
Estuaries rank among the most productive ecosystems on earth, but they are 
also subject to considerable ecological degradation associated with the loss and 
alteration of habitats and impairment of water quality due to multiple anthropogenic 
and natural drivers of change
Escalating population growth, urban and industrial development, modification 
of coastal watersheds and estuarine basins, pollution inputs, and overharvest of 
recreational and commercial species can threaten the system structure and function 
and the sustainability of the system resources.
Putting coconut fiber mat, planting marsh grass, and Mussels bed are some 
activities that protect our estuaries and intertidal environment.
An Intertidal Zone is the area between high and low tides. Although this zone 
is considered a harsh habitat, species of animals can adapt to this environment. 
The intertidal zone is home to many species of plants and animals that are most 
invertebrates.
In the intertidal zone, there is a wide variety of organisms. Organisms that live here 
can adapt to harsh environments due to difficult daily challenges in moisture, 
the turbulence of water, temperature, and salinity.
 Threats to the intertidal zone
1. Human Impact
 Humans harvest animals and plants from the intertidal zone for food, or for home 
aquariums. Moreover, many shells – especially those of marine mollusks – are 
collected as souvenirs by some people who visit the ocean coasts. There is also an 
impact on intertidal zones and their habitat, and sometimes take some of these 
creatures. This has resulted in a decrease in organisms in some areas.
2. Pollution and Coastal Development
 Pollution poses threats to tidal pool animals and plants. Coastal pollution 
includes discarded trash, sewage spills, and toxic chemical runoff. Increased 
development in coastal regions can also damage tide pools through the introduction 
of contaminants.
How intertidal species are protected? We need to protect and conserve the 
intertidal zones. Here are some practices that have been established to protect 
intertidal species.
1. Protect diversities in intertidal community
2. Provide a source of water supply for breeding stock so that useful areas nearby 
can be sustained.
3. Harvesting of intertidal species should be regulated and undertaken at sustainable levels.

                                            True or False
1. The more patriarchal a society is, the higher the level of female subordination.
2. Liberal feminists seek to expand the rights of women through legislation.
3. Agriculture doesn’t have any negative impacts on the environment.
4. The impact of human activity on the environment is always damaging.
5. As a population increases, more waste is produced as a result of increased activity.
6. Feminists are all about equality between genders-- which means feminists don't
want women to be more powerful than men any more than wanting men more powerful
than women.
7. Chito likes coffee than milk tea, but prefers milk tea to soda. This means that he
prefers coffee over soda. Transitivity of preferences as principle of rational choice
theory is demonstrated in this example.

                            6. Estuaries are important parts of our lives. They are also important parts of our 
coastal and ocean ecosystems. Estuaries provide rich feeding grounds for coastal 
fish and migratory birds and drowning areas for fish and shellfish. It is important that 
everyone helps to protect estuaries and conserve the valuable resources in the estuaries 
ecosystem.
Estuaries rank among the most productive ecosystems on earth, but they are 
also subject to considerable ecological degradation associated with the loss and 
alteration of habitats and impairment of water quality due to multiple anthropogenic 
and natural drivers of change
Escalating population growth, urban and industrial development, modification 
of coastal watersheds and estuarine basins, pollution inputs, and overharvest of 
recreational and commercial species can threaten the system structure and function 
and the sustainability of the system resources.
Putting coconut fiber mat, planting marsh grass, and Mussels bed are some 
activities that protect our estuaries and intertidal environment.
An Intertidal Zone is the area between high and low tides. Although this zone 
is considered a harsh habitat, species of animals can adapt to this environment. 
The intertidal zone is home to many species of plants and animals that are most 
invertebrates.
In the intertidal zone, there is a wide variety of organisms. Organisms that live here 
can adapt to harsh environments due to difficult daily challenges in moisture, 
the turbulence of water, temperature, and salinity.
 Threats to the intertidal zone
1. Human Impact
 Humans harvest animals and plants from the intertidal zone for food, or for home 
aquariums. Moreover, many shells – especially those of marine mollusks – are 
collected as souvenirs by some people who visit the ocean coasts. There is also an 
impact on intertidal zones and their habitat, and sometimes take some of these 
creatures. This has resulted in a decrease in organisms in some areas.
2. Pollution and Coastal Development
 Pollution poses threats to tidal pool animals and plants. Coastal pollution 
includes discarded trash, sewage spills, and toxic chemical runoff. Increased 
development in coastal regions can also damage tide pools through the introduction 
of contaminants.
How intertidal species are protected? We need to protect and conserve the 
intertidal zones. Here are some practices that have been established to protect 
intertidal species.
1. Protect diversities in intertidal community
2. Provide a source of water supply for breeding stock so that useful areas nearby 
can be sustained.
3. Harvesting of intertidal species should be regulated and undertaken at sustainable levels.
2. How can I make myself become aware of the environmental issues and problems?
