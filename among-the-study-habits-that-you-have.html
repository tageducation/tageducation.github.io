                                            Exercise vs. Video Games Do you exercise regularly?

This led to a decline of physical activity among children, making it easy to get used to the habit of not exercising. Exercise has many benefits. For instance, studies show that it boosts academic performance. In addition to that, it has been proven that children who exercise more develop healthy habits later in life. In conclusion, having plenty of exercise at your young age is a brilliant idea. Exercise needs to be established as a routine for children like you.

                                            Assimilation (Time Frame: 20 mins) When writing a report paper, you can arrange it in such a way that it is simple to read and comprehend. Although the parts you should include in your report will vary depending on the report, you can use the following report components as a reference when writing your report: 1. Title or title page 2. 2. Executive summary/abstract that briefly describes the content of your report 3. 3. Table of contents (if the report is more than a few pages) 4. 4. An introduction describing your purpose in writing the report 5. 5. Methodology, Findings/Results, Discussion 6. 6. Conclusion or recommendation depending on the purpose of the report 7. 7. References  Learning task 5: Read and comprehend the numerically written extract. Determine which part of the structure the numbered paragraph/sentence exemplifies.  Survey of Academic and General Reading in English ______1. On 8th February 1999, a survey was conducted among 16 overseas post-graduate students at the University of England. The purpose of the survey was to discover the reading habits in English of the students ______2. The survey was conducted by means of a questionnaire given to the students to complete. The first part of the questionnaire dealt with the type of reading and its frequency. The second section was concerned with newspapers: the type of items read and those that were read first. ______3. From the table of data, the most significant items are as follows. In the first section 81% of the students regularly read academic books" while 44% regularly read academic journals. Nothing else is read regularly or often by 40% or more of the students. The following comments can be made about the reading of newspapers, magazines and fiction. _______4. If any conclusions may be drawn from the data, they are, perhaps, as follows. Overseas students presumably have little time for general reading: most of their reading time is spent on books and journals on their own subject. Outside their studies, apart from reading news about their own country, international news, and news about Britain, they probably spend most time watching TV and listening to the radio.  ________5. /from Academic Writing Course by R.R.

                                            Title : Exercise vs. Video Games
1)Do you exercise regularly? Recently, a lot of video games and nother online entertainment activities have
been popping in the internet. This led to a decline of physical activity among children, making it easy to get
used to the habit of not exercising,
2)Exercise has many benefits, For instance, studies show that it boosts academic performance. In addition to
that, it has been proven that children who exercise more develop healthy habits later in life.
3)In conclusion, having plenty of exercise at your young age is a brilliant idea. Exercise needs to be stablished
as a routine for children like you. This can be achieved if you include exercise in your daily activities.</a>

                                            BUYER BEHAVIOUR AND RELATIONSHIP DEVELOPMENT RESEARCH COMPANY TRIES TO SHOW THAT YOU CAN ONLY UNDERSTAND CONSUMER BEHAVIOUR BY LIVING WITH THEIR BEHAVIOUR How can any marketer get inside your mind to understand how you actually make purchase decisions? Structured questionnaire surveys may have a role for collecting large scale factual data, but they have major weaknesses when it comes to understanding individuals' attitudes. Qualitative approaches, such as focus groups can get closer to the truth, but participants often still find themselves inhibited from telling the full story. Many marketing managers, especially those without large research budgets, inevitably end up relying on their own personal experiences to understand how consumers behave. This may be easy for target markets which are in the 20-40 age range (the age of typical marketers), but how do you get inside the mind of teenagers, or elderly people? Ethnographic approaches are becoming increasingly popular among marketers as a means of getting closer to the truth about consumer behaviour. Ethnographic research is nothing new, having been used by anthropologists in their study of the rituals of tribal people. Marketers have been relatively recent converts to the techniques of ethnography. The advertising agency BMP DDB has taken on board the techniques of ethnography in its "Project Keyhole" in a manner which is reminiscent of anthropologists' practice of living with tribes in order to understand them. Its consumer researchers live with a family for several days in order to record their every move. The project is designed to meet the needs of client companies who are looking for more than the data gathered using traditional quantitative and qualitative research techniques. Participants record their views and actions on a digital video camera, in the presence of a researcher who stays with them from 8am until 10pm for a few days.A normal project would last four or five days and the client may be invited along for part of the time. Participants are paid £100 for their troubles. What did they do with the direct mail when it came through the letter box? Did they use the coupon offer which it contained? Who drinks the fresh orange juice in the house? How long do they spend cooking dinner? How do they actually cook the ready-prepared meals they bought earlier? Does the family eat together? These are examples of the vital information that sponsoring companies hope to get hold of in order to position their products more effectively. According to the company, the advantage of this method over conventional research is that it picks up inconsistencies between what people say they are doing and what they actually do. Following them throughout the day allows the researcher to see why a person's habits might change according to random factors such as their mood, the time of day or the weather. Crucially it reveals the quirks in our behaviour that marketers are desperate to gain an insight into. For example, a person's store-card data might tell you that they buy bread and margarine, but it doesn't tell whether they eat the bread fresh, or toast it first before putting margarine on it. In 1998, the magazine Marketing put this novel research method to the test with a guinea pig family called the Jones's. It then compared the results of this approach with more traditional methods of profiling customers. In short, established systems such as CACI, Claritas and Experian might say one thing about the buying behaviour of a family, using lifestyle and electoral roll data, but did they bear any relation to reality? The information that the researcher gathered in a short space of time told a lot about the Jones family. By contrast, the database information about the Joneses, although detailed and often accurate, could not capture the quirks and details that make up the personality of the family. For example, it transpired that the Joneses had a keener than average eye on value for money. Although information on them from the four database companies correctly suggested that they enjoy luxuries like good food and foreign holidays, it didn't say anything about the real life factors that influence their purchasing decisions. The most noticeable of these was that although they like good food, Mrs Jones mixed her shopping between the supermarket and a local discount store which sells cut-price brands. This means that she only bought at Tesco or Sainsbury's what she could not get cheaper elsewhere. She showed the researcher a can of branded plum tomatoes which she got for 10p at the discount store as an example, explaining that it would have cost 26p in the supermarket. Mrs Jones prided herself on being able to hunt down bargains like this and occasionally rewarded herself by buying "something luxurious", such as smoked salmon from Marks &amp; Spencer. ​</a>

                            9. Exercise vs. Video Games Do you exercise regularly? Recently, a lot of video games and other online entertainment activities have been popping in the internet. This led to a decline of physical activity among children, making it easy to get used to the habit of not exercising. Exercise has many benefits. For instance, studies show that it boosts academic performance. In addition to that, it has been proven that children who exercise more develop healthy habits later in life. In conclusion, having plenty of exercise at your young age is a brilliant idea. Exercise needs to be established as a routine for children like you. This can be achieved if you include exercise in your daily activities. My topic is... who is article about ? why is it important for people to know about this?​</h2><br />

Survey of Academic and General Reading in English ______1. On 8th February 1999, a survey was conducted among 16 overseas post-graduate students at the University of England. The purpose of the survey was to discover the reading habits in English of the students ______2. The survey was conducted by means of a questionnaire given to the students to complete. The first part of the questionnaire dealt with the type of reading and its frequency. The second section was concerned with newspapers: the type of items read and those that were read first. ______3. From the table of data, the most significant items are as follows. In the first section 81% of the students regularly read academic books" while 44% regularly read academic journals. Nothing else is read regularly or often by 40% or more of the students. The following comments can be made about the reading of newspapers, magazines and fiction. _______4. If any conclusions may be drawn from the data, they are, perhaps, as follows. Overseas students presumably have little time for general reading: most of their reading time is spent on books and journals on their own subject. Outside their studies, apart from reading news about their own country, international news, and news about Britain, they probably spend most time watching TV and listening to the radio.  ________5. /from Academic Writing Course by R.R.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>By planning carefully and following through on her daily and weekly goals, Crystal was able to fulfill one of her goals for the semester. Although her exam scores were not as high as she had hoped, her consistently strong performance on writing assignments tipped her grade from a B+ to an A−. She was pleased to have earned a high grade in one of the required courses for her major. She was also glad to have gotten the most out of an introductory course that would help her become an effective teacher.
</p><p>
</p><p>How does Crystal’s experience relate to your own post-secondary educational experience?
</p><p>
</p><p>To do well in the post-secondary environment, it is important to stay focused on how your day-to-day actions determine your long-term success. You may not have defined your career goals or chosen a major yet. Even so, you surely have some overarching goals for what you want out of your studies to expand your career options, to increase your earning power, or just to learn something new. In time, you will define your long-term goals more explicitly. Doing solid, steady work, day by day and week by week, will help you meet those goals.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            26. BUYER BEHAVIOUR AND RELATIONSHIP DEVELOPMENT RESEARCH COMPANY TRIES TO SHOW THAT YOU CAN ONLY UNDERSTAND CONSUMER BEHAVIOUR BY LIVING WITH THEIR BEHAVIOUR How can any marketer get inside your mind to understand how you actually make purchase decisions? Structured questionnaire surveys may have a role for collecting large scale factual data, but they have major weaknesses when it comes to understanding individuals' attitudes. Qualitative approaches, such as focus groups can get closer to the truth, but participants often still find themselves inhibited from telling the full story. Many marketing managers, especially those without large research budgets, inevitably end up relying on their own personal experiences to understand how consumers behave. This may be easy for target markets which are in the 20-40 age range (the age of typical marketers), but how do you get inside the mind of teenagers, or elderly people? Ethnographic approaches are becoming increasingly popular among marketers as a means of getting closer to the truth about consumer behaviour. Ethnographic research is nothing new, having been used by anthropologists in their study of the rituals of tribal people. Marketers have been relatively recent converts to the techniques of ethnography. The advertising agency BMP DDB has taken on board the techniques of ethnography in its "Project Keyhole" in a manner which is reminiscent of anthropologists' practice of living with tribes in order to understand them. Its consumer researchers live with a family for several days in order to record their every move. The project is designed to meet the needs of client companies who are looking for more than the data gathered using traditional quantitative and qualitative research techniques. Participants record their views and actions on a digital video camera, in the presence of a researcher who stays with them from 8am until 10pm for a few days.A normal project would last four or five days and the client may be invited along for part of the time. Participants are paid £100 for their troubles. What did they do with the direct mail when it came through the letter box? Did they use the coupon offer which it contained? Who drinks the fresh orange juice in the house? How long do they spend cooking dinner? How do they actually cook the ready-prepared meals they bought earlier? Does the family eat together? These are examples of the vital information that sponsoring companies hope to get hold of in order to position their products more effectively. According to the company, the advantage of this method over conventional research is that it picks up inconsistencies between what people say they are doing and what they actually do. Following them throughout the day allows the researcher to see why a person's habits might change according to random factors such as their mood, the time of day or the weather. Crucially it reveals the quirks in our behaviour that marketers are desperate to gain an insight into. For example, a person's store-card data might tell you that they buy bread and margarine, but it doesn't tell whether they eat the bread fresh, or toast it first before putting margarine on it. In 1998, the magazine Marketing put this novel research method to the test with a guinea pig family called the Jones's. It then compared the results of this approach with more traditional methods of profiling customers. In short, established systems such as CACI, Claritas and Experian might say one thing about the buying behaviour of a family, using lifestyle and electoral roll data, but did they bear any relation to reality? The information that the researcher gathered in a short space of time told a lot about the Jones family. By contrast, the database information about the Joneses, although detailed and often accurate, could not capture the quirks and details that make up the personality of the family. For example, it transpired that the Joneses had a keener than average eye on value for money. Although information on them from the four database companies correctly suggested that they enjoy luxuries like good food and foreign holidays, it didn't say anything about the real life factors that influence their purchasing decisions. The most noticeable of these was that although they like good food, Mrs Jones mixed her shopping between the supermarket and a local discount store which sells cut-price brands. This means that she only bought at Tesco or Sainsbury's what she could not get cheaper elsewhere. She showed the researcher a can of branded plum tomatoes which she got for 10p at the discount store as an example, explaining that it would have cost 26p in the supermarket. Mrs Jones prided herself on being able to hunt down bargains like this and occasionally rewarded herself by buying "something luxurious", such as smoked salmon from Marks &amp; Spencer. ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Consumer behaviour in marketing refers to the actions and decisions that people make when they are purchasing or using products.
