                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>1.E2.A3.D4.F5.C6.H7.B8.J9.G10.I<p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>1.Cytoplasm-Cytoplasm	Found inside the cell membrane, organelles float in the gel-like substance, surrounds the nuclear membrane2.Nucleus-Known as the cell's “command center,” the nucleus is a large organelle that stores the cell's DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid). The nucleus controls all of the cell's activities, such as growth and metabolism, using the DNA's genetic information.3.Mitochondria-Mitochondria are membrane-bound cell organelles (mitochondrion, singular) that generate most of the chemical energy needed to power the cell's biochemical reactions. Chemical energy produced by the mitochondria is stored in a small molecule called adenosine triphosphate (ATP).4.Cell membrane-The cell membrane is selectively permeable to ions and organic molecules and controls the movement of substances in and out of cells.5.Lysosomes-LysosomesLysosome FunctionLysosomes are the recycling plants of the cell. They break down unwanted or worn out materials inside the cell, even other organelles.6.Cell wall-The Cell WallA cell wall is a rigid layer that is found outside the cell membrane and surrounds the cell. The cell wall contains not only cellulose and protein, but other polysaccharides as well. The cell wall provides structural support and protection.7.Golgi bodies- it packages proteins into membrane-bound vesicles inside the cell before the vesicles are sent to their destination.8.Endometric reticulum-endoplasmic reticulumSeries of canals that used to "transport materials in the cell" is called endoplasmic reticulum.9.Chloroplast-Chloroplasts are organelles that conduct photosynthesis, where the photosynthetic pigment chlorophyll captures the energy from sunlight, converts it, and stores it in the energy-storage molecules ATP and NADPH while freeing oxygen from water in plant and algal cells.10.Vacuole-Vacuole- stores water, food, waste, and other materials.Hope it helps:)<br />
