                                            What can I use as a title for this?
Back in the old days, being alone was fun because no one was going to bother you and you can do whatever you want. Also, you can focus on your studies but when I grew up, it changed me from being alone. I knew that it is dangerous because it is addicting once you see how peaceful it is like you do not want to deal with other people anymore. 
I want to elaborate on my statement that being alone is dangerous and addictive because based on my experience when I was the only child before my parents do not allow me to play outside they just let me play around the house, study, and sleep that’s all I do every day. So when I was in grade 1 my classmate was bullying me my teacher found out because I run towards her what she did was call our parent and let them know that his son was bullying me after that I sat inside the classroom alone I did what I did was reading books and dictionaries sometimes I also sat outside in a little house which we call the reading area. I hate talking to everyone when I started to experience bullying it’s not just that happens there’s a lot more reason why I do not want to talk to them even to my family and classmates but I like to talk with my cousins. I knew that when you have those experiences from being alone it’s so hard to give trust and get close to them that is why it is dangerous and addictive to be alone because all the people surround you have so many things to say and judge you even though I want to feel happy but I just want to avoid it but until I graduated from grade school I thought I’m not going to get bully again it happens many times that is why I just want to be alone forever.
When I started going to high school I observe all my classmates and I think they’re not like the people I met before grade school feels that I want to have friends now and get to know them so I give my trust to them and I started to like to be with my friends everywhere we go and do nothing to their house just having a food trip and karaoke. It is also started for becoming a rebel we are sometimes do not go to school we went to our friend’s house or go somewhere else and get drunk like if you get drunk I feel I’m the happiest person it makes me forget everything my problem, and for being alone because I have my friends but whenever I’m with them it’s like your being rebellious because you’re not listening to your family anymore it’s like you have your own world and alone again. My friends now are gone I have only one friend now which is not like my friends before she is giving me good advice and she made me realize what is better for me to do. Now I’m overthinking too much because I realize that all I do is regret all my past decisions. The fact that you are not living your life fully enough and for addicting, you cannot control or stop yourself from being alone and scared to be alone you are still going to find another way to not be alone if I did not control it maybe because it will become your habit.
To sum up, don’t be alone for a long time do not be scared to give trust and hang out with people around you because not all the people that you will get to know will not going to bully, a bad influence sometimes they’re people that will motivate you, cheer you up, accept you from who you are and loved you in deep. You should socialize explore everything try out new things, get out of your comfort zone, give your trust, and share your feelings or thoughts with your cousins because you can trust them so you will not be alone anymore.</a>

                                            Example Peddling On My Own Learning to ride a bike for the first time was an exciting and nerve-racking experience. My sister told me I was too old to still be riding a bike with training wheels when I was about five years old. That's when I made the decision to no longer depend on them. My sister and I went outside, despite my reservations, and began removing the small wheels from my bike. I was now set for the big moment after my bike had gone through the transformation. With butterflies in my stomach, I cautiously mounted the bike and grasped the handles tightly with my trembling hands. My sister, on the other hand, was clinging to me to keep me balanced. I was terrified that she would let go, but I was determined to ride the bike alone. After that, with a little prodding from her, I began to peddle. My heart beat faster as my bike accelerated. Finally, I turned around nervously and found that my sister had long since let go of my bike. I was so ecstatic that I forgot to peddle because I had achieved independence on my bike/I was lying on the ground the next move I know, but I didn't care because of the adrenaline rush. I'll never forget the exhilarating experience of riding a bike without training wheels when I was a child Activity Directions: Using the example above, identify the elements of a narrative paragraph.

                                            He Left So I Could Learn It was my second day on the job. I was sitting in my seemingly gilded cubicle, overlooking Manhattan, and pinching my right arm to make sure it was real. I landed an internship at Condé Nast Traveler. Every aspiring writer I’ve ever known secretly dreamt of an Anthony Bourdain lifestyle. Travel the world and write about its most colorful pockets. When my phone rang, and it was Mom telling me Dad had a heart attack. He didn’t make it. I felt as though the perfectly carpeted floors had dropped out from under me. Now that I’ve come out the other side, I realize Dad left me with a hefty stack of teachings. Here are three ideals I know he would’ve liked for me to embrace. First, you have to stand on your own two feet. As much as our parents love and support us, they can’t go to our school and confess to the principal that we stole a candy bar from Sara. We have to do that. Neither can they walk into the Condé Nast office and nail a job interview for us. At some point, we have to put on our “big girl pants” and be brave, even if we’re not. Also, there’s a difference between love and co-dependence. Being grateful to have someone to turn to for love and support is not the same as needing someone to turn to for love and support. With the loss of my father, I’ve also lost my sounding board. All I can glean from that is it’s time to look within myself and make proper assessments. If I can’t make sound decisions with the tools already in my kit, then I risk falling for anything. Finally, memories are, perhaps, the only item that cannot be taken away from us. Will I miss my father? Every single day. What can I do in those times? I can open up our suitcase of memories, pick out my favorite one, and dream about it, talk about it, or write about it. Maybe I can’t pick up the phone and call him anymore, but that doesn’t mean he’s gone. Next week, I’m off to Istanbul to explore their art scene. As soon as I read the email from my editor, I picked up my phone to call Dad. Then, I realized he’ll never answer my calls again. I fought back the tears, got up to make a cup of peppermint tea, and added a new note to my iPhone titled, “Istanbul Packing List.” In the end, life goes on. I’m not sure why he had to leave during the single most poignant chapter in my life. So, I won’t dwell on that. Instead, I’ll hold tightly to these three ideals and write about Karaköy in Istanbul’s Beyoğlu district. Dad will be with me every step of the way.

                                            Step 1
Be specific about the decision to be made.
Step 2
Check your options.
Process Example
Identify a list of situations where a
decision needs to be made.
• Decisions are made based on a
variety of factors, experience,
knowledge, and emotions.
• Some decisions need to be made
before the situation. For example,
Washing your hands with soap and
water before eating.
• Important decisions should be made
thoughtfully.
I am invited to a birthday party of my
bestfriend in the middle of this
pandemic. I asked permission from my
parents but they won’t allow me to go.
What should I do?
I don’t want to hurt my bestfriend for not
attending her birthday party.
I also don’t want to disobey my parents
because, at my age, I am not allowed to
go out of our house during this
pandemic.
So, I will call my bestfriend and tell her
honestly my decision of not going to her
birthday party ahead of time.
Process Example
Make a list of all of the possible options
to consider in a situation.
The following questions may help you
guide your thinking:
• Is the option healthy or unhealthy?
• How does this option affect me?
• How does this option affect others?
My options are to:
1. I could ask my best friend to talk to
my parents about her birthday party.
Outcomes, positive, I get to understand
that by going out of the house during
this pandemic, I may be able to affect
the health of my family as well as mine.
2. I can still attend her birthday party
through virtual presence.
3. My family and I are safe at home.
9
Step 3
Assess your capacity to decide.
Step 4
Make a decision and follow through.
Step 5
Describe the outcome of the decision.
Process Example
After identifying options and outcomes,
distinguish between the decisions you
can make by yourself and the decisions
with which you need help.
Consider the following questions:
• Are you having trouble coming
up with healthy options?
• Is your safety or someone else’s
safety at risk?
• Are you feeling uncomfortable
with your options?
Based on the answer to these
questions, do you need to ask a trusted
adult or refer to another resource for
help?
•I feel safe and secure with this
decision.
•I can also feel comfortable with the
healthy options that I have my family
with me at home and safe.
•I can say that I made this decision on
my own.
Process Example
You are now ready to make a decision
based on your analysis of the positive
and negative outcomes.
I chose the option that is best and
healthy both for my family and my
bestfriend during this pandemic.
Process Example
Describe the outcome of the decision
and determine if the outcome was
positive or negative for others and
yourself.
I told my parents about my decision of
telling my best friend that I am not
allowed to attend her birthday party for
now because of the pandemic.
The outcome was positive
because my parents saw my courage to
tell me best-friend about my health
option for my family and my best friend
too.

                            4. What can I use as a title for this?
Back in the old days, being alone was fun because no one was going to bother you and you can do whatever you want. Also, you can focus on your studies but when I grew up, it changed me from being alone. I knew that it is dangerous because it is addicting once you see how peaceful it is like you do not want to deal with other people anymore. 
I want to elaborate on my statement that being alone is dangerous and addictive because based on my experience when I was the only child before my parents do not allow me to play outside they just let me play around the house, study, and sleep that’s all I do every day. So when I was in grade 1 my classmate was bullying me my teacher found out because I run towards her what she did was call our parent and let them know that his son was bullying me after that I sat inside the classroom alone I did what I did was reading books and dictionaries sometimes I also sat outside in a little house which we call the reading area. I hate talking to everyone when I started to experience bullying it’s not just that happens there’s a lot more reason why I do not want to talk to them even to my family and classmates but I like to talk with my cousins. I knew that when you have those experiences from being alone it’s so hard to give trust and get close to them that is why it is dangerous and addictive to be alone because all the people surround you have so many things to say and judge you even though I want to feel happy but I just want to avoid it but until I graduated from grade school I thought I’m not going to get bully again it happens many times that is why I just want to be alone forever.
When I started going to high school I observe all my classmates and I think they’re not like the people I met before grade school feels that I want to have friends now and get to know them so I give my trust to them and I started to like to be with my friends everywhere we go and do nothing to their house just having a food trip and karaoke. It is also started for becoming a rebel we are sometimes do not go to school we went to our friend’s house or go somewhere else and get drunk like if you get drunk I feel I’m the happiest person it makes me forget everything my problem, and for being alone because I have my friends but whenever I’m with them it’s like your being rebellious because you’re not listening to your family anymore it’s like you have your own world and alone again. My friends now are gone I have only one friend now which is not like my friends before she is giving me good advice and she made me realize what is better for me to do. Now I’m overthinking too much because I realize that all I do is regret all my past decisions. The fact that you are not living your life fully enough and for addicting, you cannot control or stop yourself from being alone and scared to be alone you are still going to find another way to not be alone if I did not control it maybe because it will become your habit.
To sum up, don’t be alone for a long time do not be scared to give trust and hang out with people around you because not all the people that you will get to know will not going to bully, a bad influence sometimes they’re people that will motivate you, cheer you up, accept you from who you are and loved you in deep. You should socialize explore everything try out new things, get out of your comfort zone, give your trust, and share your feelings or thoughts with your cousins because you can trust them so you will not be alone anymore.</h2><br />

                            9. Example Peddling On My Own Learning to ride a bike for the first time was an exciting and nerve-racking experience. My sister told me I was too old to still be riding a bike with training wheels when I was about five years old. That's when I made the decision to no longer depend on them. My sister and I went outside, despite my reservations, and began removing the small wheels from my bike. I was now set for the big moment after my bike had gone through the transformation. With butterflies in my stomach, I cautiously mounted the bike and grasped the handles tightly with my trembling hands. My sister, on the other hand, was clinging to me to keep me balanced. I was terrified that she would let go, but I was determined to ride the bike alone. After that, with a little prodding from her, I began to peddle. My heart beat faster as my bike accelerated. Finally, I turned around nervously and found that my sister had long since let go of my bike. I was so ecstatic that I forgot to peddle because I had achieved independence on my bike/I was lying on the ground the next move I know, but I didn't care because of the adrenaline rush. I'll never forget the exhilarating experience of riding a bike without training wheels when I was a child Activity Directions: Using the example above, identify the elements of a narrative paragraph.

                            12. He Left So I Could Learn It was my second day on the job. I was sitting in my seemingly gilded cubicle, overlooking Manhattan, and pinching my right arm to make sure it was real. I landed an internship at Condé Nast Traveler. Every aspiring writer I’ve ever known secretly dreamt of an Anthony Bourdain lifestyle. Travel the world and write about its most colorful pockets. When my phone rang, and it was Mom telling me Dad had a heart attack. He didn’t make it. I felt as though the perfectly carpeted floors had dropped out from under me. Now that I’ve come out the other side, I realize Dad left me with a hefty stack of teachings. Here are three ideals I know he would’ve liked for me to embrace. First, you have to stand on your own two feet. As much as our parents love and support us, they can’t go to our school and confess to the principal that we stole a candy bar from Sara. We have to do that. Neither can they walk into the Condé Nast office and nail a job interview for us. At some point, we have to put on our “big girl pants” and be brave, even if we’re not. Also, there’s a difference between love and co-dependence. Being grateful to have someone to turn to for love and support is not the same as needing someone to turn to for love and support. With the loss of my father, I’ve also lost my sounding board. All I can glean from that is it’s time to look within myself and make proper assessments. If I can’t make sound decisions with the tools already in my kit, then I risk falling for anything. Finally, memories are, perhaps, the only item that cannot be taken away from us. Will I miss my father? Every single day. What can I do in those times? I can open up our suitcase of memories, pick out my favorite one, and dream about it, talk about it, or write about it. Maybe I can’t pick up the phone and call him anymore, but that doesn’t mean he’s gone. Next week, I’m off to Istanbul to explore their art scene. As soon as I read the email from my editor, I picked up my phone to call Dad. Then, I realized he’ll never answer my calls again. I fought back the tears, got up to make a cup of peppermint tea, and added a new note to my iPhone titled, “Istanbul Packing List.” In the end, life goes on. I’m not sure why he had to leave during the single most poignant chapter in my life. So, I won’t dwell on that. Instead, I’ll hold tightly to these three ideals and write about Karaköy in Istanbul’s Beyoğlu district. Dad will be with me every step of the way.

                            13. Step 1
Be specific about the decision to be made.
Step 2
Check your options.
Process Example
Identify a list of situations where a
decision needs to be made.
• Decisions are made based on a
variety of factors, experience,
knowledge, and emotions.
• Some decisions need to be made
before the situation. For example,
Washing your hands with soap and
water before eating.
• Important decisions should be made
thoughtfully.
I am invited to a birthday party of my
bestfriend in the middle of this
pandemic. I asked permission from my
parents but they won’t allow me to go.
What should I do?
I don’t want to hurt my bestfriend for not
attending her birthday party.
I also don’t want to disobey my parents
because, at my age, I am not allowed to
go out of our house during this
pandemic.
So, I will call my bestfriend and tell her
honestly my decision of not going to her
birthday party ahead of time.
Process Example
Make a list of all of the possible options
to consider in a situation.
The following questions may help you
guide your thinking:
• Is the option healthy or unhealthy?
• How does this option affect me?
• How does this option affect others?
My options are to:
1. I could ask my best friend to talk to
my parents about her birthday party.
Outcomes, positive, I get to understand
that by going out of the house during
this pandemic, I may be able to affect
the health of my family as well as mine.
2. I can still attend her birthday party
through virtual presence.
3. My family and I are safe at home.
9
Step 3
Assess your capacity to decide.
Step 4
Make a decision and follow through.
Step 5
Describe the outcome of the decision.
Process Example
After identifying options and outcomes,
distinguish between the decisions you
can make by yourself and the decisions
with which you need help.
Consider the following questions:
• Are you having trouble coming
up with healthy options?
• Is your safety or someone else’s
safety at risk?
• Are you feeling uncomfortable
with your options?
Based on the answer to these
questions, do you need to ask a trusted
adult or refer to another resource for
help?
•I feel safe and secure with this
decision.
•I can also feel comfortable with the
healthy options that I have my family
with me at home and safe.
•I can say that I made this decision on
my own.
Process Example
You are now ready to make a decision
based on your analysis of the positive
and negative outcomes.
I chose the option that is best and
healthy both for my family and my
bestfriend during this pandemic.
Process Example
Describe the outcome of the decision
and determine if the outcome was
positive or negative for others and
yourself.
I told my parents about my decision of
telling my best friend that I am not
allowed to attend her birthday party for
now because of the pandemic.
The outcome was positive
because my parents saw my courage to
tell me best-friend about my health
option for my family and my best friend
too.
