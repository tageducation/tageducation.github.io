                                            The Eagle KiteIn a dry cornfield near a nipa hut, sat a boy who is looking amazingly at theblue sky. Lucio enjoyed gazing at the different shapes of kites flying freely abovethe clouds. "Wow, they are so colourful! How I wish I could make one also," hesaid to himself.The next day, he visited his friend Lucas who happened to be busy doingsomething. "Hello Lucas, how are you? It seems you are busy," said Lucio. "Yesmy friend, I am trying to make an eagle-shaped kite. I would love to fly this as soonas I am done fixing it," answered Lucas." Can I go with you?" asked Lucio. 'Sure,my friend, together we will fly my kite," replied Lucas.Lucio and Lucas had a good time flying the eagle-shaped kite together withthe other children in the cornfield. The eagle-shaped kite glided through the air andflew higher and higher above the sky. In a few moments, Lucas tried to pull thestring but something went wrong. The eagle-shaped kite was caught tied in abranch of a mango tree. Lucas was so worried on what to do." Stay here Lucas. Iwill climb the mango tree and get your kite." After several minutes, Lucio camedown from the tree and brought his friend's kite."Thank you Lucio, you are such a helpful friend. So I will be giving you thiskite of mine. It is all yours. I will be making another one, so we can fly our kitestogether," said Lucas. Lucio was so happy because he had already a kite which hereally dreamed to have. summary​ </a>

                                            Activity Read the following carefully. Then answer and discuss the questions at the end of the story.Jane and Rose are best of friends working in the same agency. While they were having their coffee break one day, Rose having three children going to school complained to Jane how difficult to make ends meet with the meager salary they are receiving. When Jane heard her friend, she said “why don’t you put-up a sideline? You are a good cook. You can sell peanut adobo, brittle, peanut butter or other food products. I am sure you will not have problems in terms of raw materials because these raw materials are abundant in our community.Rose is sold to the idea and persuaded her friend to be her partner. The two friends contributed P2,000.00 each to start the business. They agreed to have equal profit. Rose would take care of production while Jane will concentrate in marketing. Jane started getting orders while Rose concentrated in cooking. When they succeeded in getting big orders, they decided to register their business as a partnership under the name R &amp; J Food Products. From then on, their customers have regular orders and even becoming bigger.After six months of operation, the partners earned P20,000.00 and they decided to divide it equally between them. Meanwhile, Rose was exhausting herself with her production efforts, while Jane’s life went on very casually because once the first orders have been booked, most of the buyers placed repeated orders.Before the business reached its first-year anniversary, Rose got sick and advised to rest. Rose can no longer cook and Rose husbands forbade her to continue the business.1. What went wrong with the business? 2. If you were Rose would you enter into a partnership with a friend or would you register the venture as a sole proprietorship?3. Were the partners right in splitting the profits equally? 4. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of partnership.​please pa answer po kahit dalawang questions lang</a>

If small business owners and commercial lenders choose to ignore the a large number of errors manufactured by organization lenders, as documented in a well-known phrase we may be condemned to reiterate these faults.</p><p></p><p>In assessing the virtually all significant business loans problems, massive greed is a great inescapable look between financing institutions. Bad results were not surprisingly produced by an attempt to create higher-than-normal income and easy gains. The only persons seemingly shocked by the damaging loss will be the lenders themselves. The largest small enterprise lender in the us declared personal bankruptcy after 2 yrs of seeking to get another individual to pay off for the mistakes. I will be already viewing a record a higher level commercial lender failures, and by most accounts a lot of the largest bankers should experience recently been allowed to fail but were instead maintained artificial government funding.</p><p></p><p>When creating loans or perhaps buying securities such simply because all those right now categorised as deadly properties, presently there were a large number of instances in which banks failed to look in cash flow. Designed for some business finance applications, a said income commercial loan underwriting process was used in which will professional consumer tax returns were not actually expected or perhaps analyzed. Lehman Friends was you of the most impressive commercial loan providers using this procedure, and they recorded for personal bankruptcy last 12 months just for this simply because well as other unethical financial practices.</p><p></p><p>Commercial bankers routinely misplaced sight of a basic investment principle that asset values will not really always enhance and reality can easily reduce quickly. Various are actually were finalized in which the professional borrower got little or no resources at risk. When buying the future toxic assets, loan providers themselves devoted as small as three cents to the dollar. The apparent assumption was that if any downhill fluctuation in Bonnispaz shipping value happened, it would definitely be a token three to five percent. To illustrate just how wrong the bankers had been, commercial realty prices in numerous areas have already lowered in the past two years simply by up to 50 %. Commercial realty is appearing to be the next toxic asset on all their harmony pages just for the many banks which manufactured the basic professional mortgages upon many of these business homes. While there were large government bailouts to finance institutions which possess harmful belongings depending on residential home loans, this is not most likely that loan companies definitely will receive fiscal assistance to covers professional property bank loan failures. Over the next three years it is actually at the moment projected that these developing commercial mortgage losses will pose significant problems to get the carrying on your survival of many organization lenders. Irrespective of ongoing concern and criticism about current reduced business lending activity, many professional lenders possess effectively stopped any significant small organization a finance. Seeing that known in the pursuing paragraph, the actual banks state doing is usually not necessarily just like their actual lending practices.</p><p></p><p>A current and ongoing is actually represented by misleading and inaccurate claims by organization lenders of their lending activities which involve small company loans to business owners. While many banks include reported that they are continuing normally with small enterprise finance courses, by virtually any standard our results reveal something completely different. From a public contact thoughts and opinions, that is distinct that bankers would somewhat not declare widely that they happen to be not loaning normally. Simply because a consequence of this kind of issue on your, small business owners will have to be cautious and skeptical inside their attempts to secure business loan.</p><p></p><br />

When Jane heard her friend, she said “why don’t you put-up a sideline? You are a good cook. You can sell peanut adobo, brittle, peanut butter or other food products. I am sure you will not have problems in terms of raw materials because these raw materials are abundant in our community.Rose is sold to the idea and persuaded her friend to be her partner. The two friends contributed P2,000.00 each to start the business. They agreed to have equal profit. Rose would take care of production while Jane will concentrate in marketing. Jane started getting orders while Rose concentrated in cooking. When they succeeded in getting big orders, they decided to register their business as a partnership under the name R &amp; J Food Products. From then on, their customers have regular orders and even becoming bigger.After six months of operation, the partners earned P20,000.00 and they decided to divide it equally between them.

Be able to look for at least five (5) opinions andthe words that signal them.I went home late at night and pondered on things. My nerve muscles were in pain. It was a big day forme.Eight (8) hours was not enough that I rendered additional two (2) to finish my task as office assistant.After I had introduced myself to the team, no one bothered to throw a 'hi' on me. The department head orientedme in her office for half an hour and instructed me to go to my workstation. Puzzled, I went to the wrongdepartment. The struggle was there when I had no one to talk to; I assumed nobody would like to befriend me.They were all busy with their urgent tasks. All of them were office staff and I alone was their newly hiredassistantI happened to ask and meet Mrs. Gracias, the team leader whom I preferred to talk to than myofficemates. She clearly discussed to me what to accomplish from time to time.I felt that my not so friendly workmates were keeping an eye on me.I believe I've had enough of the wrong work system this morning. Until the clock ticks 5AM and I realizedall those were part of my dream and excitement to attend my first day in online class.​</h2><br />

                            14. Georgina and Cath are best of friends since childhood. During this pandemic, they decided to put up their online business. Cath is good in making Tocino while Georgina is good in selling because she has a background in Marketing.
They contributed 5,000 each and decided to split their profit equally. They both agreed that Cath will be in charge in production while Georgina will be in charge on taking orders online as well as its marketing and promotion. The business
started to receive bulk orders both on their acquaintances and others who visited their online site. After a year of operation, Cath started getting sick and was advised to have a bed rest. Now, Cath cannot continue the production of Tocino until she gets back to health again.
1. What went wrong with their business?
2. Where do you think did Georgina and Cath missed to plan on their business? Explain your argument.
3. How do you think they can improve their business?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><strong>They included themselves in the systems of their business. Therefore, their business became their personal job over time.</strong><strong>They never plan for the expansion of the business. They think small. If one of them or both of them can work, then the business can't operate. The business depends on them.</strong><strong>I think if they hired some employees that can help them with the business's daily operations, they could have scaled the business. They should hire skilled employees and automate the business.</strong><p>For more information, visit;</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/16013130</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/13496877</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>#BRAINLYFAST</strong></p><p></p><br />
