                                            Instruction: Read the situation carefully. Apply the Seven Step Reasoning Modelto determine the best ethical choice to make. Write your answer in the spaceprovided below."Please Don't Tell!"A twenty-year-old Hispanic male was brought to a hospital emergencyroom, having suffered abdominal injuries due to gunshot wounds obtained ingang violence. He had no medical insurance, and his stay in the hospital wassomewhat shorter than expected due to his good recovery. Physiciansattending to him felt that he could complete his recovery at home just as easilyas in the hospital and he was released after only a few days in the hospital.During his stay in the hospital, the patient admitted to his primaryphysician that he was HIV positive, having contracted the virus that causesAIDS. This was confirmed by a blood test administered while he was hospitalized.When he was discharged from the hospital, the physician recommended thata professional nurse visit him regularly at home in order to change the bandageson his still substantial wounds and to ensure that an infection did not develop.Since he had no health insurance, he was dependent on Medicaid, agovernment program that pays for necessary medical care for those whocannot afford it. However, Medicaid refused to pay for home nursing care sincethere was someone already in the home who was capable of providing thenecessary care. That person was the patient's twenty-two-year-old sister, whowas willing to take care of her brother until he was fully recovered. Their motherhad died years ago, and the sister was accustomed to providing care for heryounger siblings.The patient had no objection to his sister providing this care, but heinsisted that she not be told that he had tested HIV positive. Though he hadalways had a good relationship with his sister, she did not know that he was anactive homosexual. His even greater fear was that his father would hear of hishomosexual orientation and lifestyle. Homosexuality is generally looked uponwith extreme disfavor among Hispanics.The patient's physician is bound by his code of ethics that places a very high priority on keeping confidentiality. That is, information about someone'smedical condition that he or she does not want known cannot be divulged bythe physician. Some would argue that the responsibility of confidentiality is evengreater with HIV/AIDS since disclosure of someone's homosexuality normallycarries devastating personal consequences for the individual who is forced "outof the closet."On the other hand, the patient's sister is putting herself at risk by providingnursing care for him. Doesn't she have a right to know the risks to which she issubjecting herself, especially since she willingly volunteered to take care of herbrother?If you were the physician, what would you do in this case? Would youbreach the norm of confidentiality to protect the patient's sister, or would youkeep confidentiality in order to protect the patient from harm that would cometo him from his other family members, especially his father?Perhaps as good a question as "what would you do" in this situation is thequestion, "how would you decide what to do" in this situation? The process ofmaking a moral decision can be as important as the decision itself, and manyethical decisions that people encounter are so complex that it is easy to exhaustoneself talking around the problem without actually making any progresstoward resolving it. The response to many moral dilemmas is "where do I start?'and the person who is faced with these decisions often needs direction that willenable him or her to move constructively toward resolution and "see the forestfor the trees."In order to adequately address the ethical dilemmas that peopleencounter regularly, the following is a model that can be used to ensure that allthe necessary bases are covered. This is not a formula that will automaticallygenerate the "right" answer to an ethical problem. Rather it is a guideline that isdesigned to make sure that all the right questions are being asked in the processof ethical deliberation.​</a>

Rizal scholar Esteban de Ocampo and historian Ambeth Ocampo attest that the nationalhero was an incurable fan of written works by some of the world's best-known authors.According to them, among the late hero's favorites were the popular novels: The ThreeMusketeers, The Count of Monte Cristo, and Robinson Crusoe.2. He painted. He sculpted. He planted. He did carpentry.The superb intellect of our national hero did not stop him from also using his hands tocreate.3. Dr. Rizal had this enviable habit of overcoming the blows that life had dealt him.His mother was unjustly charged and imprisoned. He was maligned, vilified, andsubjected to an unfair trial.4. He appears to have been inspired by the adventurous, swashbuckling spirit of thesecharacters.It may be safe to assume that the major characters in those novels had a majorinfluence on Dr. Rizal.5. Imagination, child psychologists point out, is important in human development. It iswhat brings about the so-called "critical thinking" and "creative problem-solving skills."In layman's terms, these are one's abilities to see and examine all sides of a situationand to think out of the box as one searches for solutions.Source​</a>

Write your answer in the spaceprovided below."Please Don't Tell!"A twenty-year-old Hispanic male was brought to a hospital emergencyroom, having suffered abdominal injuries due to gunshot wounds obtained ingang violence. He had no medical insurance, and his stay in the hospital wassomewhat shorter than expected due to his good recovery. Physiciansattending to him felt that he could complete his recovery at home just as easilyas in the hospital and he was released after only a few days in the hospital.During his stay in the hospital, the patient admitted to his primaryphysician that he was HIV positive, having contracted the virus that causesAIDS. This was confirmed by a blood test administered while he was hospitalized.When he was discharged from the hospital, the physician recommended thata professional nurse visit him regularly at home in order to change the bandageson his still substantial wounds and to ensure that an infection did not develop.Since he had no health insurance, he was dependent on Medicaid, agovernment program that pays for necessary medical care for those whocannot afford it. However, Medicaid refused to pay for home nursing care sincethere was someone already in the home who was capable of providing thenecessary care. That person was the patient's twenty-two-year-old sister, whowas willing to take care of her brother until he was fully recovered. Their motherhad died years ago, and the sister was accustomed to providing care for heryounger siblings.The patient had no objection to his sister providing this care, but heinsisted that she not be told that he had tested HIV positive. Though he hadalways had a good relationship with his sister, she did not know that he was anactive homosexual. His even greater fear was that his father would hear of hishomosexual orientation and lifestyle. Homosexuality is generally looked uponwith extreme disfavor among Hispanics.The patient's physician is bound by his code of ethics that places a very high priority on keeping confidentiality. That is, information about someone'smedical condition that he or she does not want known cannot be divulged bythe physician. Some would argue that the responsibility of confidentiality is evengreater with HIV/AIDS since disclosure of someone's homosexuality normallycarries devastating personal consequences for the individual who is forced "outof the closet."On the other hand, the patient's sister is putting herself at risk by providingnursing care for him. Doesn't she have a right to know the risks to which she issubjecting herself, especially since she willingly volunteered to take care of herbrother?If you were the physician, what would you do in this case? Would youbreach the norm of confidentiality to protect the patient's sister, or would youkeep confidentiality in order to protect the patient from harm that would cometo him from his other family members, especially his father?Perhaps as good a question as "what would you do" in this situation is thequestion, "how would you decide what to do" in this situation? The process ofmaking a moral decision can be as important as the decision itself, and manyethical decisions that people encounter are so complex that it is easy to exhaustoneself talking around the problem without actually making any progresstoward resolving it. The response to many moral dilemmas is "where do I start?'and the person who is faced with these decisions often needs direction that willenable him or her to move constructively toward resolution and "see the forestfor the trees."In order to adequately address the ethical dilemmas that peopleencounter regularly, the following is a model that can be used to ensure that allthe necessary bases are covered. This is not a formula that will automaticallygenerate the "right" answer to an ethical problem. Rather it is a guideline that isdesigned to make sure that all the right questions are being asked in the processof ethical deliberation.​</h2><br />

Rizal scholar Esteban de Ocampo and historian Ambeth Ocampo attest that the nationalhero was an incurable fan of written works by some of the world's best-known authors.According to them, among the late hero's favorites were the popular novels: The ThreeMusketeers, The Count of Monte Cristo, and Robinson Crusoe.2. He painted. He sculpted. He planted. He did carpentry.The superb intellect of our national hero did not stop him from also using his hands tocreate.3. Dr. Rizal had this enviable habit of overcoming the blows that life had dealt him.His mother was unjustly charged and imprisoned. He was maligned, vilified, andsubjected to an unfair trial.4. He appears to have been inspired by the adventurous, swashbuckling spirit of thesecharacters.It may be safe to assume that the major characters in those novels had a majorinfluence on Dr. Rizal.5.

                        <p>If I was him, I'd be frustrated too. I don't even know how to play a piano, I even have both hands. I never give up since I know everyone has hope. Everyone has god by their side. Just remember, someone has worse conditions as you are. You shouldn't be frustrated, because it'll just make you fall. It's like, carrying a bucket of water and the hill is half a mile long, if you stop, you'll drip a drop.  And one little drop makes 1 hope of you dissapear. Just carry on what you're doing. Because someday, you'll be the top of them all.</p><br />
