It helps you understand how to prevent extinction of organisms inan ecosystemIn this module, you will learn that all organisms need energy to sustain lifeYour study will focus on how organisms obtain energy from food and how organismsproduce energyIn order to sustain life, all organisms require energy, but not all of them canuse light energy directly for life activities. To provide the energy needed by allorganisms, plants and other chlorophyll-bearing organisms capture the energy ofsunlight and convert it into chemical energy stored in the food. When people andother heterotrophic organisms eat food from producers and consumers, chemicalenergy stored from food is transferred to their bodies. Do you know how theseprocesses are being done by our body and by other living organisms?What are expected of you to learn in this module?1. Differentiate basic features and importance of photosynthesis and respirationa) Describe the parts of organelles involved in photosynthesis and cellularrespirationb) Describe the process of food making by plants.c) Describe how stored energy from food is changed to chemical energy for celld) Identify the factors that affect the rate of bhotouse.​</a>

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>→ You can see the answer in the picture below. Photosynthesis What is Photosynthesis? Green plants use photosynthesis to transform solar energy into chemical energy. Parts of plants are given energy by this chemical energy. In order to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose, chlorophyll and sunlight are required. In plants, starch is used as a form of energy storage. Concept of photosynthesis Water serves as the substrate for the multi-stage process of photosynthesis, which also requires sunlight and carbon dioxide. It generates oxygen as well as the simple carbohydrate molecules. glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GA3P). which can be converted into other sugar molecules like sucrose and glucose. Covalent bonds found in these sugar molecules aid in the storage of energy. These molecules are broken down by the organisms to produce energy for cellular activity. These photosynthesis-performing organisms are referred to as photoautotrophs, which means that they can directly synthesize food using light energy from water and carbon dioxide. This photosynthesis activity occurs at a specific location in plants. It involved some pigments that absorb light, which is necessary for photosynthesis. The process of photosynthesis involves several steps. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate molecules are produced (NADPH). To obtain nutrition and energy, photosynthesis is crucial for plants. Known as oxygenic photosynthesis, photosynthesis occurs in algae, plants, and cyanobacteria to produce oxygen. The reaction's by-product is the release of oxygen. This is the most common type of photosynthesis used by living things. However, there are differences in this process between cyanobacteria, plants, and algae. Anoxygenic photosynthesis, which absorbs carbon dioxide but does not release oxygen, is a type of photosynthesis primarily used by bacteria.</p><br />
