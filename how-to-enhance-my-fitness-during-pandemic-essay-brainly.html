                        <p>The benefits of physical activity and exercise have been demonstrated across the lifespan. We are meant to move and many of our body’s systems work better when we are consistently physically active.</p><p></p><p>For managing symptoms of depression, some research suggests that elevated levels of aerobic activity (exercise that significantly raises our heart rates) may be associated with greater reductions in depressive symptoms. Consider engaging in physical activity once or twice daily that includes brief periods (30-90 seconds) of greater intensity. For some, this might be accomplished through exercise in their homes including jumping jacks, mountain climbers, and sequencing strength training exercises (i.e. standing squats, push-ups, sit-ups). For others, the use of home exercise equipment such as treadmills, elliptical machines, and stationary bikes may be helpful.</p><p>We recommend finding physical activities that you enjoy and to share your experience with others. At the same time, there is also evidence to suggest that exercise can be helpful to mood even if the act of doing the exercise is not as enjoyable.</p><p></p><p>It is important for family members to take a supportive role in the promotion of physical activity and exercise. Allowing individuals to maintain their autonomy and choice in their activities will be important for ongoing engagement.</p><p></p><p>We are all managing additional stress related to the growth of the COVID-19 pandemic and its potential to threaten the health of ourselves, our families, and our communities</p><br />

Not real life, right?</p><p></p><p>We’ve all changed this year. We’ve lived through historic times, and it’s nearly impossible to experience something of this magnitude without it having an impact. The time-out from regular life forced us to re-examine our values, our relationships and our lifestyles, while determining whether we are living a life of design and not one of default.</p><p></p><p>Now that most lockdowns have ended and life is starting to return to normal in many states, or at least a variation of “normal,” let’s take a few moments to reflect on some life lessons we can learn from living under lockdown.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>As a student during the COVID-19 pandemic, I have spent a lot of time finding my new flow. I was the type of student who lived by the saying “The early bird gets the worm." I would often wake up early, get a couple hours of studying in every weekday before classes at either a coffee shop of on campus. I would usually work on assignments between classes, and I would sometimes stay on campus after class to finish up my work. When I went home, I was home, and I did a good job of not taking my work home with me. This is how I found balance, and it really worked for me!  </p><p>When campus had to be closed due to the government’s orders, classes transitioned to Zoom calls. Usually, most course material and class assignments were submitted online, so that part didn't change much, but there was a huge barrier I had to work hard to overcome: being home and doing school work. I had to get creative, so I set up a space in my dining room that acted as my office. I had a really fun time decorating it, putting plants in it for me to enjoy while studying, using candles and crystals to create a focused, calm environment. I bought an adjustable desk that I used to stand during lectures, which was a great way for me to switch things up when I started to feel distracted. I also bought a comfy seat cushion for when I needed to sit and study. I made the most of my classes and maintained my motivation by continuing to check in with my friends in my cohort, and scheduling out my days.  </p><p>Now when I have classes, I usually wake up at 7am, make some coffee, get dressed and have a fueling and delicious breakfast! My “work time” which consisted of Zoom lectures, working on assignments and studying was usually from 8am until 6pm. I would take a break mid-day and go for a nice walk around my neighborhood, often down to Lake Sammamish, and get a quick bite to eat when I got back. After my scheduled work time, I would enjoy time with my partner (who was living with me during the stay-at-home order), usually by cooking a home-made meal, watching a movie, making art and crafting or listening to audiobooks.  </p><p>There was a lot of restructuring and relearning how to be a student during the COVID-19 pandemic, but even with the added challenges and changes to the structure of the University because of COVID-19, the bonds between my cohort and my friends are holding strong. I still was able to get the most out of my classes (something I realized after reflecting on all I had learned during the school year!), and overall I still really value my experience during my second year. I think that speaks to the dedication of the administration, the dependability of the staff, and how invested our professors are. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        Physical Activities and Exercise during Pandemic
<p>
</p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic has taken a toll on almost every area of daily life, including fitness schedules. How, where, and where we workout has evolved as a result of work-from-home, remote learning, and public health requirements for gyms and fitness centers that include capacity limits, maintenance procedures, mask wearing, and social distancing.
</p><p>
</p><p>The physical and emotional well-being of emergency responders is currently being severely strained, and keeping a level of physical conditioning will go a long way toward assisting both. The advantages of keeping fit are well known: Improvements in cardiovascular and respiratory fitness, improved blood sugar control, and the ability to limit or replace prescription drugs are all possibilities. Few of the more well-known benefits include weight loss, cancer risk reduction, and increased musculoskeletal ability (with example, for diabetes or blood pressure).
</p><p>
</p>When it comes to the COVID-19 pandemic, why is exercise so important?  Standard, moderate-intensity workout has immune-boosting effects, according to research, which can help the body battle infections like COVID-19.
Exercise will help you burn excess calories caused by lifestyle changes to offset the effects of sedentary habits, which can lead to weight gain.
Exercise decreases stress and anxiety: Exercise is a validated mood enhancer that can assist adults in reducing stress and increasing mental tolerance.
Daily exercise has been shown to help you fall asleep quicker and increase the consistency of your sleep, and having a decent night's sleep has also been shown to strengthen your immune system.
<p>
</p>
Despite COVID-19's closures, how do I remain physically active?  Exercise for your loved ones.
Get some fresh air while staying healthy: Walking, cycling, jogging, and hiking are all great ways to get some much-needed fresh air while being safe from others.
With the help of online fitness videos, you can follow along.
Consider taking a simulated lesson.
Put yourself to the test. Make a fitness target for yourself.
<p>
</p><p>
</p>How to encourage people to workout?  For certain individuals, increasing their physical activity is a significant improvement. Applaud the first move and keep reinforcing the decision to get involved.
Listen to the problems, come up with ideas, pat yourself on the head, and congratulate yourself on your accomplishments.
Walking together is a wonderful way to be active and catch up with a friend.
Try activities that are just right for two — dance lessons or doubles tennis.
Travel, illness, and work can get in the way of physical activity. Work together to find ways to get back on track as soon as possible.

Making a specific time to be active helps ensure you get your daily physical activity.</p><p></p><p>Here are some tips Staying healthy in lockdown</p><p>• Follow a routine-If you’re put into a stricter lockdown, it’s important to create a routine to give your day structure.</p><p>• Eat well-Try to prepare nutritious meals if you can. Eating well is good for both your physical and mental health.</p><p>• Keep hydrated-Drinking enough fluids helps your body function properly. The Eatwell Guide recommends you have six to eight glasses of fluid a day, but drink a bit more if your exercising.</p><p>• Avoid excess-It can be easy to form unhealthy habits as a way of coping. While these might feel like they’re helping you deal with the situation, they often make you feel worse in the long term.</p><p>• Take time to switch off-While it’s important to stay informed, try not to constantly refresh the news if you find it makes you feel anxious, angry or stressed.</p><p>• Spend time in nature-Take time to be in nature if you can. If you can go outside, then try going for a walk or run in a green space. If you can’t leave your house, just looking out of your window can help. </p><p>• Maintain relationships-Many of us have been apart from some of our loved ones for a long time now. This can be very difficult and upsetting. Try to keep in regular contact using phone or video calls if you can.</p><p>• Seek support-For many people, the idea of going into a stricter lockdown may feel overwhelming. You might feel sad, anxious, stressed or angry. How you feel might also change as time goes on. If you’re struggling, make sure you reach out to somebody and talk about how you’re feeling. This could be a loved one, your GP, your employer or a mental health organization.</p><p>• Be kind-It’s natural to feel a whole range of feelings during times of uncertainty and change. Some days will be better than others. This is a time to be kind to yourself and to those around you. Be patient with yourself and your loved ones.</p><p></p><p></p><br />
