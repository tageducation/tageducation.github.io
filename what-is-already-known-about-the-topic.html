</strong><strong>Importance of literature review:</strong><br /><br />
It consist  simple summary of key sources
but usually has an organizational pattern and combines both summary and
synthesis. It is often within the specific conceptual categories only. <br /><br />
When we say summary, it is the recap of important information of the source yet
synthesis is a re-organization of that information in a way that it informs how
you are planning to inquire and investigate a research problem. <br /><br />

The analytical features of a literature review might give new interpretation of
materials, old and new with interpretations; trace the intellectual progression
of the field and its major debates; evaluate the sources to advise readers on
the most relevant part; identify the gaps that exist in how a problem has been
researched to date. <br /><br /><br /><strong>Purpose of literature review in research</strong></p><strong>

</strong><p><br />
The purpose of a literature review is to place each work in the contribution’s context
to the understanding of the research problem being studied as well as to describe
the relationship of each work to the others. It also identifies new ways to
interpret and enlighten any gaps in previous researches as it resolves
conflicts in contradictories against other studies. Literature review must identify
areas of prior scholarship to avoid repetition of efforts and point the way in
fulfilling a need for additional researches.<br />
 <br />
Literature review surveys books, articles especially those that are published
scholarly and any other sources related to the particular issue and area of
research or theory. It must provide description, summary, and critical
evaluation of works in relation to the investigated research problem.<br /><br />
One of the <strong>reasons for conducting
literature review </strong>is to not only identify potential areas for research as
it identifies similar work completed within the area but also identify the
knowledge gaps that demand further investigation.<br /><br /><br /><strong>
</strong><strong>What is literature review in research
methodology?</strong><br /><br />Literature review as a text of some scholarly paper includes current
knowledge including substantive and practical findings, theoretical sources and
most importantly, with methodological contributions to the topic. Literature
reviews are secondary sources and apparently report the old or original
experimental works only.  <strong>Literature review methodology,</strong> in
contrast to the traditional or narrative review, is the systematic reviews use more
demanding and well-defined approach to review the literature in the chosen specific
subject. Systematic reviews are in fact being used to answer well-focused inquiries.<br /><br />*********more information below<strong></strong>*********<br /><br /><br /><strong>How to write literature review for research proposal?</strong><br /><br />
