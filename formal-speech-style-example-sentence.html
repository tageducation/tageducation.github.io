There's the "frozen" style, the "formal" style, the "consultative" style, the "casual" style, and the "intimate". It means that when people want to talk to each other, they can choose from five different styles.</p><p></p><strong>Frozen style</strong>, also called fixed speech, is the highest level of communication style. It is often used in respectful situations or formal events like Shakespearean plays, weddings, funerals, and more. It uses complicated sentence structures and words that only experts in that field would know.<p></p>The<strong> formal style</strong> uses formal words and phrases and is more common in writing than in speech. It also doesn't let you use ellipses, contractions, or modal adverbs that qualify.<p></p>The <strong>consultative style</strong> is basically an unplanned speech since the speaker uses the participation and feedback of the audience. The speaker will give some background information, but the listener is always involved.<p></p><strong>Casual style</strong>, also called informal style, is usually used between friends or even people who know each other well and have things to share.
