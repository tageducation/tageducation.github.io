                                            Living in one's ethnic community in a new land is very pleasant, (1)…………  it definitely has some disadvantages. Let me explain what I mean through personal example. At first, when I came from China to Auckland, I was very happy because some of my old friends were living in the same neighborhood. A year later, (2) …………… , my family and I decided to move from that area in order to live near where we worked. That day I began to feel that I was living in another country, in another Auckland. My first problem came when I tried to tell my landlord that our refrigerator was broken. He didn’t speak Mandarin, (3)……………… I didn’t speak English. Little things like that made me feel unhappy and insecure, (4) ………………I did not want to go back to my own ethnic community. I was living in a new country, (5) ……………  I had to do things for myself. I had to learn a different culture, a different language, and different customs. Living with my ethnic group was very comfortable, (6) …………… at the same time it was harmful (7) ………………  I didn’t learn some of the essentials for survival in a new country. It was an important, though painful, lesson to learn.</a>

Do it on your worksheet • This year I had the best summer vacation ever. My whole family went to Aklan where my grandparents live. They live near the ocean. While we were there we did a lot of fun stuff. My grandfather taught me how to play chess, and I found out that I am good at it. My little sister had day camp so I didn't have to watch her all day like I usually do in the summer. I took sailing lessons. My boat tipped over so many times but I learned how to take the water out of the boat and get back on it. I hope I can go back to Aklan next summer. Developing Mastery​</a>

                                            I. Read the selection and answer the following questions. Bats Bats fly like birds, yet in fact they are mammals. They are the only mammals that can truly be said to fly. Their wings do not have feathers, but are made of thin sheet of skin stretched between the long "finger" bones. In most bats, the wings are also joined to the legs and tail. There are more than 2000 different kind of bats. Most live in the tropics and warm parts of the world. The biggest of all bats are the fruit-eaters or flying foxes. One, the kalong, has a wingspan of 1.5 meters. The insect-eaters are usually smaller. Their wingspan is rarely as much as 30cm. They live in most parts of the world. Where winters are cold, they hibernate. Questions: 1. What are bats? 2. What parts of the world do they mostly live?3. Their wings are made of what? 4. What types of bats are the biggest?​</a>

My whole family went to Aklan where my grandparents live. They live near the ocean. While we were there we did a lot of fun stuff. My grandfather taught me how to play chess, and I found out that I am good at it. My little sister had day camp so I didn't have to watch her all day like I usually do in the summer. I took sailing lessons. My boat tipped over so many times but I learned how to take the water out of the boat and get back on it. I hope can go back to aklan next summer.​</a>

                            22. I. Read the selection and answer the following questions. Bats Bats fly like birds, yet in fact they are mammals. They are the only mammals that can truly be said to fly. Their wings do not have feathers, but are made of thin sheet of skin stretched between the long "finger" bones. In most bats, the wings are also joined to the legs and tail. There are more than 2000 different kind of bats. Most live in the tropics and warm parts of the world. The biggest of all bats are the fruit-eaters or flying foxes. One, the kalong, has a wingspan of 1.5 meters. The insect-eaters are usually smaller. Their wingspan is rarely as much as 30cm. They live in most parts of the world. Where winters are cold, they hibernate. Questions: 1. What are bats? 2. What parts of the world do they mostly live?3. Their wings are made of what? 4. What types of bats are the biggest?​</h2><br />

                        1. The poem is entitled that way because the author misses his home.<br /><br />2. The home that the speaker is talking about in the poem is the home where he grew up as a child. <br /><br />(alt ! the home that the speaker is talking about is a loving and caring home, where he feels safe, and comfy in)<br /><br />3. the big city<br /><br />4. The speaker hopes to be back home someday<br /><br />5.
