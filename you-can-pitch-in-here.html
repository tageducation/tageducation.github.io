                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>1.Fluid singing - singing with a straight tone especially. for indigenous music. This can be achieved with a. good breathing technique.</p><p> </p><p>2.Melisma (Greek: μέλισμα, melisma, song, air, melody; from μέλος, melos, song, melody, plural: melismata) is the singing of a single syllable of text while moving between several different notes in succession.</p><p></p><p>3.When singing high notes, like notes above middle C (in mix voice and head voice), I should pronounce the vowels "narrower".</p><p></p><p>4.People with a nasal voice can sound as though they're speaking through a clogged-up or runny nose, which are both possible causes. Your speaking voice is created when air leaves your lungs and flows upward through your vocal cords and throat into your mouth. The resulting sound quality is called resonance.</p><p></p><p>5.Vocal strain, officially known as muscle tension dysphonia (MTD), is an overuse of the vocal cords that presents itself in many uncomfortable or painful symptoms. This voice problem can dramatically alter your voice's sound and quality, and requires proper care and treatment to prevent permanent damage.</p><p></p><p>6.In music theory, a phrase (Greek: φράση) is a unit of musical meter that has a complete musical sense of its own, built from figures, motifs, and cells, and combining to form melodies, periods and larger sections. A phrase is a substantial musical thought, which ends with a musical punctuation called a cadence.</p><p></p><p>7.Tremolo is essentially a variation in volume, vibrato in pitch. ... For wind instruments and voice, what could be considered sort-of-tremolo is rather called "vibrato": a certain regular variation in loudness achieved by an elasticity in the breath control and (in the case of the voice) a relaxed throat and voicebox.</p><p></p><br />
