                        <p>without art there would be no dance. Therefore, kinesthetic participation at social gatherings such as weddings and/or clubs. In addition, cultural traditions and/or religious ceremonies would not be expressed through movement. Dance would not be performed in theatres, music videos, or on television. We would be a culture that did not value kinesthetic expression, relying solely on verbal expression as a means of communication.</p><p></p>Without any guidelines for behavior, conventions for behavior, people would do lots more injury to other. Let me give you an example. I am now in North Carolina. The lady I bought my house from said that when she was a kid she would just walk in through the back door of any house. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />A life without art is in reality not a life at all. We all need art in our lives, and we'd be lying by denying it. Art, in its many forms, is a necessity of life. It is beneath the building structure of anything and everything. A life and a world without art would be quiet and dull. Many people have continued to desensitize art. Without history and a sense of the past, you have no sense of the traps that the future will have in store. I grew up in a little town that resembled what would happen if a giant threw all of its memory.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />History is the RECORD of what happened in the past. No record, no history. And this represents a major challenge faced by any people without a written history. Historical records can be archived.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
