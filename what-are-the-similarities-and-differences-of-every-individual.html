                                            What Are the Differences Between City Life and Farm Life?
Farm life provides a natural environment surrounded by trees, animals, and
the natural life cycle. The environment where cities live is based on concrete,
buildings, and very small observable properties. In the agricultural lifestyle, people
work in the land every day, cultivate food and breed animals. City lifestyle provides
work to office buildings and retail shopping districts.
Families living in the agricultural lifestyle are often together, and each
member contributes to the management of the farm. City life is more busy, it is
more common for families to leave each other pursuing their own personal
purpose. In the city, special families are established to take care of the elderly of
the family.
From the perspective of individual needs, farmers pay more attention to the
necessity of things and the necessity of lack of things. Farmers need to prioritize
demand, but advertising and commercialism are not so attractive. Urban life makes
more materialism possible, and urban people tend to equate their needs. Urban life
is often competitive and people are further promoted by material needs.
Another contrast between city life and farm life is the surrounding
environment. Farm life is often referred to as a more peaceful and healthy lifestyle.
For example, farm life provides residents with the opportunity to have a good time
in nature, without going to places like parks. Individuals are surrounded by
natural gifts such as trees, sunlight, wind, animals, circulation of nature. In
contras, people who are living in the city live in daily stress related to urban life
such as getting involved in traffic congestion, coping with high crime rates, and in
most cases paying a higher tax rate. There is no need to suffer. It is well known
that lack of such stress factors can have a major impact on overall quality of life.
Alternatively, urban life is often portrayed as being fast-paced, modern, polluted,
full of work stress and economic pressure (re-comparison 1).
When comparing the life on the farm and the life in the city, there are many
differences and similarities between the two. Each of these places has a special and
unique one. The choice of the place of residence is very personal and it depends on
personal values. I personally prefer farm life, but other people may choose to live in
the city because they are enjoying more busy and social lifestyles. Factors to
consider before choosing two are the environment, lifestyle, and family values.

                            9. What are the similarities and differences of every individual?</h2><br />
                        The similarities of individuals far outweigh the differences as long as we do not dwell on every minute detail of our diversities. If we look at the overall broad similarities of individuals, are we all not seeking "Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness"? It is only when we categorize these three staples of existence that we begin to believe we are different from one another. <br />We all want to have a life. One individual may want to have a simple life with few burdens due to social achievement or possession of products while another individual may want to achieve great social status and accumulate as many possessions as they can. Depending on how we view these two individuals, they are either very similar or very different. If we perceive these two individuals as being similar, there is nothing we would do to try to change the lives of either. If we view these individuals as being different, each individual would want to make laws preventing the other from being able to live their life the way they want to. This falls under the ideology of fascism; one person feeling they have some sort of right to dictate how another lives their life.<br />We all want the liberty to be able to do what we believe we should have the right to do. This one gets more complicated because there are many things that an individual may want to do that may adversely affect what other individuals want to do. Obviously, in a civilized society, no one should have the liberty to enact a direct crime on another. For an example we can use a current hot topic. One individual believes everyone should have the liberty to own firearms as long as they are used responsibly and never used to enact a crime. Another individual believes that they should have the liberty to make firearm ownership illegal based on the assumption that a few will use the firearms in an illegal manner. If we view these individuals as being the same in their desire for liberty, there is nothing we would do to change either of their lives. If we view these individuals as being different because of the diversity in their beliefs, then we must create adversarial laws attempting to appease each of the differences based on the belief of the one individual who believes they should have the liberty to take away the liberty of another. Again, we are now wading into fascist waters,<br />We all want to be able to pursue happiness for us as individuals. Happiness is a very subjective issue. <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>i</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>d</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>v</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>d</strong><strong>u</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>l</strong><strong>s</strong> are similar in terms of Image, Esthetics, Morals and Relationality.

                            20. What Are the Differences Between City Life and Farm Life?
Farm life provides a natural environment surrounded by trees, animals, and
the natural life cycle. The environment where cities live is based on concrete,
buildings, and very small observable properties. In the agricultural lifestyle, people
work in the land every day, cultivate food and breed animals. City lifestyle provides
work to office buildings and retail shopping districts.
Families living in the agricultural lifestyle are often together, and each
member contributes to the management of the farm. City life is more busy, it is
more common for families to leave each other pursuing their own personal
purpose. In the city, special families are established to take care of the elderly of
the family.
From the perspective of individual needs, farmers pay more attention to the
necessity of things and the necessity of lack of things. Farmers need to prioritize
demand, but advertising and commercialism are not so attractive. Urban life makes
more materialism possible, and urban people tend to equate their needs. Urban life
is often competitive and people are further promoted by material needs.
Another contrast between city life and farm life is the surrounding
environment. Farm life is often referred to as a more peaceful and healthy lifestyle.
For example, farm life provides residents with the opportunity to have a good time
in nature, without going to places like parks. Individuals are surrounded by
natural gifts such as trees, sunlight, wind, animals, circulation of nature. In
contras, people who are living in the city live in daily stress related to urban life
such as getting involved in traffic congestion, coping with high crime rates, and in
most cases paying a higher tax rate. There is no need to suffer. It is well known
that lack of such stress factors can have a major impact on overall quality of life.
Alternatively, urban life is often portrayed as being fast-paced, modern, polluted,
full of work stress and economic pressure (re-comparison 1).
When comparing the life on the farm and the life in the city, there are many
differences and similarities between the two. Each of these places has a special and
unique one. The choice of the place of residence is very personal and it depends on
personal values. I personally prefer farm life, but other people may choose to live in
the city because they are enjoying more busy and social lifestyles. Factors to
consider before choosing two are the environment, lifestyle, and family values.

No two people are exactly alike. All individuals differ in many aspects. Even children born into one family will not have identical similarities.<strong> Each individual is a unit that is different from one other.</strong> Two aspects can be the point of view of this difference, namely horizontal and vertical. The <strong>horizontal side </strong>represents individual differences in the <strong>mental field</strong>, including the level of intelligence, talent, interest, memory, emotion, and others. At the same time, <strong>vertical differences </strong>are differences related to <strong>physical aspects</strong>, such as body shape, height, body size (big or small), strength, and various other things.</p>Cognitive Difference<p>Cognitive abilities are abilities related to the mastery of science and technology. Based on one's observation and absorption of an object, each person can have their perception of these things. Thanks to the knowledge he has obtained, a person can form a perception of what he is experiencing, and the knowledge gained will belong to that person.</p>Background Difference<p>One's achievements can be hampered or accelerated due to differences in background and experience. This is apart from the potential possessed by each person to learn and absorb and master various information. Kinds of individual differences that become differentiating factors between people include interests, habits, skills, and the ability to concentrate.</p>Behavioral Differences<p>Other kinds of individual differences are differences in behavior. Some people have more positive attitudes toward a particular topic, subject, and profession than others. What can produce positive attitudes toward a specific topic, subject, and discipline is education that has been provided since childhood.

                        What are the similarities and differences if every individual?
	Any community is affected by some sort of difference and similarities. This is attributed to the unavoidable contact between the community's residents. Less friction to be predicted where there is only one race and only one society. Yet we all know this isn't going to continue, so people want to travel around more. This migration habit produces differences that influence life in the society as a whole. Depending on the person, how one responds to somebody who looks different will decide whether or not the community has effectively progressed towards a more tolerant society.
Individuals are similar in terms of Image, Esthetics, Morals and Relationality. Specific distinctions, on the other hand, include neurological characteristics, intelligence, personality traits and value.
