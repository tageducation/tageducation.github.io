Motion is a phenomenon that is very common in our daily life like how car travel moves, the air we breathe, the blood in our veins, and even how our minds work or think is in motion. In our Dreams, our mind tends to see our inspiring insights in life become possible. That capacity or ability to direct the behavior to our dreams is known as power of the mind which probably tells you that you need to sort out your life routine. Inspiring your minds with your dreams to put it in action is known as energy. Applying these contexts of Laws of Motion, Power and Energy will surely make your dreams in reality. Materials to be used: • Pencil REFLECTIVE JOURNAL Directions: From the box/frame shown below, draw the picture/ caricature of your wonderful dreams in life, then discuss the description of your dreams below. Open again your SLMs, book or search on the internet to get the statements of the laws of motion, and meaning of work, power and energy. Put the references of citing below. Do this in a short bond paper with 1 cm margins. • Any coloring materials available • Ruler • Short bond paper​</a>

Many of you must feel robbed as we are al stuck in our homes forced to deal with at that is happening from a distance The pandemic has brought our lives to a halt like nothing else could competing to imagine our world anew. How do we navigate through the uncertainties posed by our time? The simple truth is that there are no ready-made answers for this question. None of us have gone through ma before. No one realy 100-percent ready for what comes next What I can say, however, is that I myself have gone through periods of uncertainty And my experiences have taught me to be at peace with the act of stepping into the unknown by anchoring mysed on two things looking outward and moving forward Look beyond ourselves names of cra, many will feel the urge to think only of ones to founder, and o retreat in cur anal comes of comfort. When the fateful plane crash took the life of my husband. Jesse, it turned my whole world and those of my children upside down But the way the nation grieved with us and the impact of the legacy Jesse left behind plucked me out of the shadows I realized that there are things greater than ourselves and that there are causes that will always be worth fighting for no matter Ilamed that shing back into our bubbles, allowing fear and get to paralyze us only leads in deeper despair. We need to book beyond ourselves and expand our circles of empathy-whom we wil help, whom we will, whom wer will ve for We need to ask the hand, important questions How can I make the world a better place for others? How do I make sure that I will love this world better man when bund it? Where am most needed now? Many of you have big dreams. Some of you want to be doctors and act wyers and accourants, engineers and architects, teachers and joumalas anong many others There a reason so put your rews on hot in fact, you called to pursue these dreams with even deeper sovet dream not only for yourselves and for your families, but for the at the east and the t Move forward Amid difficulty, what keeps me going is seeing that each small task, each affor help someone goes a long way. That every food pack eases a bit of the burden on families who have lost their incomes. That every protective equipment aut makes a medical front-liner foul safer. That every palengke delivery made means that a market vendor and tricycle driver eam enough to put food on the table. This is how we can move forward + Furwant by regaining anchorage on amat, real things with real outcomes, ming one step after another as we strive to reach our goals. Forward knowing that doing aomeng for acmeone else can be a spul save for the cray that we c Forward, knowing that we are caled to do everything we can for the good of others especially those that need hep the most Looking outward and moving forward-this is how we can bravely face the new world. With passion and purpose. With grit and resolve Win compassion and with courage Dear graduates, no matter what the future holds, stay on the side of courage and be nopetal for better days. When the path seems too difficult, remember that you were made for the time-to pave a new way forward for our nation, and for the rest of DISCUSSION QUESTIONS: Answer each given question below using about 3 sentences.1.

Motion is a phenomenon that is very common in our daily life like how car travel moves, the air we breathe, the blood in our veins, and even how our minds work or think is in motion. In our Dreams, our mind tends to see our inspiring insights in life become possible. That capacity or ability to direct the behavior to our dreams is known as power of the mind which probably tells you that you need to sort out your life routine. Inspiring your minds with your dreams to put it in action is known as energy. Applying these contexts of Laws of Motion, Power and Energy will surely make your dreams in reality. Materials to be used: • Pencil REFLECTIVE JOURNAL Directions: From the box/frame shown below, draw the picture/ caricature of your wonderful dreams in life, then discuss the description of your dreams below. Open again your SLMs, book or search on the internet to get the statements of the laws of motion, and meaning of work, power and energy. Put the references of citing below. Do this in a short bond paper with 1 cm margins. • Any coloring materials available • Ruler • Short bond paper​</h2><br />

Read Vice President Leni Robredo graduation message to Class of 2020 and identify its geographic and linguistic dimension Dearest Class of 2020 Congrats to you and to your proud parents for making this f I know this is not how you imagined your graduation to be-no applause, no IG worthy photos no partes, no big speeches. Many of you must feel robbed as we are al stuck in our homes forced to deal with at that is happening from a distance The pandemic has brought our lives to a halt like nothing else could competing to imagine our world anew. How do we navigate through the uncertainties posed by our time? The simple truth is that there are no ready-made answers for this question. None of us have gone through ma before. No one realy 100-percent ready for what comes next What I can say, however, is that I myself have gone through periods of uncertainty And my experiences have taught me to be at peace with the act of stepping into the unknown by anchoring mysed on two things looking outward and moving forward Look beyond ourselves names of cra, many will feel the urge to think only of ones to founder, and o retreat in cur anal comes of comfort. When the fateful plane crash took the life of my husband. Jesse, it turned my whole world and those of my children upside down But the way the nation grieved with us and the impact of the legacy Jesse left behind plucked me out of the shadows I realized that there are things greater than ourselves and that there are causes that will always be worth fighting for no matter Ilamed that shing back into our bubbles, allowing fear and get to paralyze us only leads in deeper despair. We need to book beyond ourselves and expand our circles of empathy-whom we wil help, whom we will, whom wer will ve for We need to ask the hand, important questions How can I make the world a better place for others? How do I make sure that I will love this world better man when bund it? Where am most needed now? Many of you have big dreams. Some of you want to be doctors and act wyers and accourants, engineers and architects, teachers and joumalas anong many others There a reason so put your rews on hot in fact, you called to pursue these dreams with even deeper sovet dream not only for yourselves and for your families, but for the at the east and the t Move forward Amid difficulty, what keeps me going is seeing that each small task, each affor help someone goes a long way. That every food pack eases a bit of the burden on families who have lost their incomes. That every protective equipment aut makes a medical front-liner foul safer. That every palengke delivery made means that a market vendor and tricycle driver eam enough to put food on the table. This is how we can move forward + Furwant by regaining anchorage on amat, real things with real outcomes, ming one step after another as we strive to reach our goals. Forward knowing that doing aomeng for acmeone else can be a spul save for the cray that we c Forward, knowing that we are caled to do everything we can for the good of others especially those that need hep the most Looking outward and moving forward-this is how we can bravely face the new world. With passion and purpose. With grit and resolve Win compassion and with courage Dear graduates, no matter what the future holds, stay on the side of courage and be nopetal for better days. When the path seems too difficult, remember that you were made for the time-to pave a new way forward for our nation, and for the rest of DISCUSSION QUESTIONS: Answer each given question below using about 3 sentences.1.
