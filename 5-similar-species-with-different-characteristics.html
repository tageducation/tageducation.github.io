                                            THUMBS UP IF CORRECT, THUMBS DOWN IF INCORRECT 6. The modern concept of species does not mean that all individual members of species are precisely alike.7. Similarities in anatomical, physiological, or behavioral characteristics determine whether a population constitute a species.8. The final criterion for classifying species is always the organisms physical features.9. In the early system of classification, common names were assigned to organisms based on theire similarities in appearance and characteristics which is misleading since same organisms was referred to with different names and different languages or dialects.10. The use of scientific names helps eliminate mistaken identify and false assumption.11. Species concepts originate in taxomony, where the species is the basic rank of classification.12. Species are often defined as a group of individuals with different characteristics, can interbreed to produce fertile offspring's.13. Knowing the concepts os a species helps determine whether this shared reproduction within a population of organisms in a certain community.14. The correct order of taxonomic classifications or categories are Kingdom, Domain, Phylum, Ordee, Class, Family, Genus and Species.15. Knowing the concepts of species led us in determining if certain species can interbreed, produce interfile offspring and whether there are barrier to reproduction with other organisms.

These are anatomical features that different organism share as a resultof a common ancestor.4. A process in which some variations in an organism helped them surviveand reproduce.5. He wrote the book "Origin of Species". He presented evidence for his"descent with modification" or the "Theory of Evolution".6. He was the first evolutionist to believe that organism change overtime.7. It implies that the fittest organism survive and spread their traitthrough a population.8.

Evolution is an artificial selection which the mechanism.3. The term used for similar characteristics shared by organisms is called hematology.4. The DNA codes and similar proteins of various organisms showed strikingsimilarities.5. The continental drift theory developed by Darwin Wegener states that the movementof plate tectonics shifted different continents, isolating certain landmasses.6. All continents form from pieces of one giant supercontinent called Pangaea.7. Darwin also proposed a mechanism for evolution: natural selection.8. More offspring are produced than can survive. In living organisms, manycharacteristics are inherited, or passed from parent to offspring.9. Offspring vary in their heritable traits. The offspring in any generation will be slightlydifferent from one another in their traits (color, size, shape, etc.).10. Traits are often heritable. Organisms are capable of producing more offspring thantheir environments can support.​</h2><br />
