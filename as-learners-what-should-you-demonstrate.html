                                            Discussion A fact can be proven by using general references such as textbooks, encyclopedia, and the like. It tells us what happened and can be proven true by referring to evidence, observation and research. Opinion expresses an individual point of view. Opinions evaluate, judge or express feelings and emotions that cannot be proven right or wrong. It is what a person believes or thinks about something. Opinion differs from one person to another. Example of Fact: The Philippines is an archipelagic country in Southeast Asia that has three main geographical divisions namely: Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao. Dr. Jose Rizal is known as the national hero of the Filipino people. Emilio Aguinaldo is the 1 President of the Republic of the Philippines. The People Power Revolution, also known as the EDSA Revolution, was a series of popular demonstrations in the Philippines from February 22-25, 1986. Taal Volcano is a large caldera filled by Taal Lake in the Philippines which last erupted on January 12, 2020. Example of Opinion: Although Philippines is one small country, it has the happiest people. I like to read novels written by Dr. Jose P. Rizal. Emilio Aguinaldo is the best president in the Philippine history. For me, EDSA Revolution is the most peaceful demonstration made by Filipino people. The learners affected by Taal Volcano eruption prefer face to face learning than modular learning. When analyzing reading materials, you may consider that facts show certainties and definite information like numbers and verified record while opinions state the personal feeling of a person about something. It is also easy to look after the signal words that show whether the statement is fact or opinion. Signals words for facts include numbers, dates and statistics while signal words for opinions include words such as “prefer”, “think”, “should”, “like” and “best”. A. Directions: Look at the picture below and tell whether the following sentences state fact or opinion. Write F for fact and O for opinion. Do this in your notebook. B. Directions: Classify the following statements whether they are fact or opinion. Write them on their proper column. Do this in your answer sheet. 1. Electricity can produce magnets. 2. Magnets can produce electricity. 3. Many kids like to play magnets than toy car. 4. I think people can create energy. 5. Electromagnet attracts pins and thumbtacks 6. High voltage level can cause death. 7. A stronger magnet can be produced by using more coils of wire. 8. For me all ll appliances work well with electromagnets. 9. The best generator is made of electromagnet. 10. Perhaps magnet should be used to add more electricity. Fact Opinion 1. 1. 2. 2. 3. 3. 4. 4. 5. 5. C. Directions: Encircle the word fact if the sentence is a true concept and opinion if it is based on personal feelings. Do this in your answer sheet. 1. One year is composed of 12 months. FACT OPINION 2. For me, my cousin is more than beautiful Liza Soberano. FACT OPINION 3. The sun is very hot. FACT OPINION 4. Mercury is the closest planet to the sun. FACT OPINION 5. Love songs are the best music genre. FACT OPINION 6. Eating ice cream can calm everybody. FACT OPINION 7. New Year’s Day is celebrated during January 1st. FACT OPINION 8. Dogs are the kindest domestic pets. FACT OPINION 9. In my opinion, Mathematics is the easiest subject. FACT OPINION 10 The Philippines has 109.58 million population. FACT OPINION ​</a>

                            4. Discussion A fact can be proven by using general references such as textbooks, encyclopedia, and the like. It tells us what happened and can be proven true by referring to evidence, observation and research. Opinion expresses an individual point of view. Opinions evaluate, judge or express feelings and emotions that cannot be proven right or wrong. It is what a person believes or thinks about something. Opinion differs from one person to another. Example of Fact: The Philippines is an archipelagic country in Southeast Asia that has three main geographical divisions namely: Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao. Dr. Jose Rizal is known as the national hero of the Filipino people. Emilio Aguinaldo is the 1 President of the Republic of the Philippines. The People Power Revolution, also known as the EDSA Revolution, was a series of popular demonstrations in the Philippines from February 22-25, 1986. Taal Volcano is a large caldera filled by Taal Lake in the Philippines which last erupted on January 12, 2020. Example of Opinion: Although Philippines is one small country, it has the happiest people. I like to read novels written by Dr. Jose P. Rizal. Emilio Aguinaldo is the best president in the Philippine history. For me, EDSA Revolution is the most peaceful demonstration made by Filipino people. The learners affected by Taal Volcano eruption prefer face to face learning than modular learning. When analyzing reading materials, you may consider that facts show certainties and definite information like numbers and verified record while opinions state the personal feeling of a person about something. It is also easy to look after the signal words that show whether the statement is fact or opinion. Signals words for facts include numbers, dates and statistics while signal words for opinions include words such as “prefer”, “think”, “should”, “like” and “best”. A. Directions: Look at the picture below and tell whether the following sentences state fact or opinion. Write F for fact and O for opinion. Do this in your notebook. B. Directions: Classify the following statements whether they are fact or opinion. Write them on their proper column. Do this in your answer sheet. 1. Electricity can produce magnets. 2. Magnets can produce electricity. 3. Many kids like to play magnets than toy car. 4. I think people can create energy. 5. Electromagnet attracts pins and thumbtacks 6. High voltage level can cause death. 7. A stronger magnet can be produced by using more coils of wire. 8. For me all ll appliances work well with electromagnets. 9. The best generator is made of electromagnet. 10. Perhaps magnet should be used to add more electricity. Fact Opinion 1. 1. 2. 2. 3. 3. 4. 4. 5. 5. C. Directions: Encircle the word fact if the sentence is a true concept and opinion if it is based on personal feelings. Do this in your answer sheet. 1. One year is composed of 12 months. FACT OPINION 2. For me, my cousin is more than beautiful Liza Soberano. FACT OPINION 3. The sun is very hot. FACT OPINION 4. Mercury is the closest planet to the sun. FACT OPINION 5. Love songs are the best music genre. FACT OPINION 6. Eating ice cream can calm everybody. FACT OPINION 7. New Year’s Day is celebrated during January 1st. FACT OPINION 8.

With the limitation of in-person interaction, it’s sometimes easy to disengage during these difficult times. Now, more than ever, students need to stay engaged in their classes. You are responsible for your knowledge.</p><p></p><p>2. <strong>Practice patience.</strong> </p><p>Be patient with yourself; be patient with others. While we encourage you to remain positive and hopeful, we acknowledge that this is a significant disruption to many and being able to adapt may be difficult.

                        <p>answer:</p><p>The worldwide COVID-19 pandemic has caused a fast and radical shift across colleges and universities to remote and online teaching models.  As such, our face-to-face courses have been taken out of the physical classroom and thrust into virtual domains.  While many instructors are fluent and may prefer online teaching practices, others are struggling to rapidly expand their skill sets and become fluent in technologies they have never, or perhaps only briefly, explored. </p><p></p><p>Although this transition to a remote teaching and learning format is uncomfortable for many of us, it has been inspirational to witness the collaborations that have emerged as a result of this pandemic.  More specifically, in order to support these hasty efforts to move teaching online, a variety of communities of instructors have emerged to provide guidance, advice, tutorials, and other resources to help themselves and their colleagues achieve “good enough-ness” (teaching excellence is not the goal right now) in continuing to teach their students.</p><p></p><p>The recent emphasis on logistical resources and teaching-related information is understandable.  Anecdotal accounts abound of instructors experiencing great anxiety at having been directed simply to “put classes online”, and these resources and information can help alleviate that anxiety and empower instructors to keep teaching.  What has received less attention, however, has been discussion of how we as instructors should lead our students and inspire them in this time of emergency.  Indeed, it is important to remember that while this is a new and unsettling experience for us, this is an equally new and unsettling experience for our students (many of whom are likely to be displaced from their housing situations and/or face economic hardships).</p><p></p><p>How we address these changing circumstances to our students will markedly impact their own reactions.  We have an opportunity to use our teaching personas, philosophies, and practices to both help our students understand and manage the gravity of this current crisis and reassure them that we have some control, even in this uncertain situation, to create positive personal and professional experiences through our continuing academic connections.  Below, we provide recommendations for how we can use our teaching personas, philosophies, and practices to lead our students during this crisis.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>#pag mali itama nyo ko</p><p></p><br />

                        <p>This question is not specific to what crisis it is referring to. So I decided to explain what students and teachers must <strong>demonstrate for educational success during the “covid-19 pandemic” crisis</strong>.</p><p></p><p>1. As learners, students must prepare <strong>strategies</strong> to improve the learning process in the midst of a pandemic and be able to master and utilize <strong>technology</strong>.</p><p></p><p>2. As a teacher, in the learning process to <strong>improve</strong> children's development according to their abilities, especially as a <strong>facilitator</strong>.</p><p></p><p><strong>EXPLANATION:</strong></p><p><strong>The Covid-19 pandemic </strong>has spread to all parts of the world, including the Philippines, which has brought significant changes to people's lives, especially the world of education. Learning that is usually carried out face-to-face must switch to <strong>online</strong> or network learning. Therefore, the role of demonstrations for the nation's next generation must prepare <strong>strategies</strong> to improve the learning process in the midst of a pandemic. By utilizing various existing <strong>technologies</strong> to improve the capabilities and skills of human resources through the field of digital technology-based education to overcome the challenges of globalization which continues to move rapidly.</p><p></p><p>The teacher is certainly a figure who has an important role in the learning process to <strong>improve</strong> children's development according to their abilities. Teachers are facilitators in learning to support children's development, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic, teachers are required to be able to demonstrate teacher competence in guiding children. During the pandemic, according to the instructions of the Minister of Education and Culture, schools must be able to carry out <strong>online</strong> <strong>learning</strong>, therefore both teachers and students must be able to <strong>carry</strong> <strong>out</strong> online learning. Teachers must continue to carry out their duties in teaching and educating children even without having to meet face to face with students.</p><p></p><p>So the role of the teacher is very much needed in <strong>supporting</strong> the online learning process so that during the Covid-19 pandemic the children's learning process does not become neglected and they can still learn happily without feeling burdened in the learning process.</p><p></p><p>Learn more about <strong>the management crisis, environmental crisis and professional Crisis:</strong></p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/21691635</p><p></p><p>#SPJ3</p><br />
