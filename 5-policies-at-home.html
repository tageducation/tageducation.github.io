                        <p>Answer:</p><p>For me my most hated rule in the house is that everybody must be home at 8pm because what if you have a group project or you are invited to your friend's birthday who is just near you, of course you can't go because 8 pm you must be at home. There are also times when you have a project to do and you need to spend the night, your groupmates will be the ones to adjust because there is a rule in your house, it seems embarrassing to do so. There are days when we really break the rules at home but for me our parents should understand why we break the rules because there are things we can't avoid or we don't expect to happen just like having a sudden deadline of project and needs to be submitted as soon as possible of course we will do everything to finish the project immediately even if we arrive late at night just to finish the project. And when I come home, my parents will be angry again because I broke the rule again. That’s why my most hated rule in the house is Everybody must be home at 8 PM.</p><p></p><p>Explanation:</p><p>Just my opinion. Hope it helps po</p><p></p><br />
