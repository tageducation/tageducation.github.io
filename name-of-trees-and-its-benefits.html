Afterwards, identify the problems/issues met by the author in his desire to improve his community by listing down the issues in the table provided then put a label what issue is it Sanitary Reform and Famine Relief by: M.K. Gandhi It has always been possible for me to reconcile myself to any one member of the body politic remaining out of use. I have always been loathe to hide or connive at the weak points of the community or to press for its rights without having purged it of its blemishes Therefore, ever since my settlement in Natal. I had been endeavoring to clear the community of a charge that had been leveled against it, not without a certain amount of truth The charge had often been made that the Indian was slovenly in his habits and did not keep his house and surroundings clean. The principal men of the community had, therefore, already begun to put their house in order, but house-to-house inspection was undertaken only when plague was reported to be imminent in Durban. This was done after consulting, and gaining the approval of the city fathers, who had desired our cooperation Our cooperation made work easier for them and at the same time lessened our hardships. For whenever there is an outbreak of epidemics, the executive, as a general rule, get impatient, take excessive measures and behave to such as may have incurred their displeasure with a heavy hand. The community saved itself from this oppression by voluntarily taking sanitary measures But I had some bitter experiences. I saw that I could not so easily count on the help of the community in getting it to do its own duty, as I could in claiming for its rights At some places I met with insults, at others with polite indifference. It was too much for people to bestir themselves to keep their surroundings clean Toe expect them to find money for the work was out of the question. These experiences taught me better than ever before, that without infinite patience it was impossible to get the people to do any work. It is the reformer who is anxious for the reform, and not the society, from which he should expect nothing better than opposition, abhorrence and even moral persecution Why may not society regard as retrogression what the reformers holds dear as life itself? Nevertheless, the result of this agitation was that Indian community learnt to recognize more or less the necessity for keeping their house and environments clean I gained the esteem of the authorities. They saw that, though I had made it my business to ventilate grievances and press rights, I was no less keen and insistent upon self-purification There was one thing, however, which still remained to be done, namely, the awakening in the Indian settler of a sense of duty to the motherland India was poor the Indian settler went to South Africa in search of wealth, and he was bound to contribute part off his earnings for the benefit of his countrymen in the hour of their adversity. This the settler did during the terrible famines of 1897 and 1899. They contributed handsomely for famine relief, and more so in 1899 than 1897 We had appealed to Englishmen also for funds, and they had responded well. Even the indentured Indians gave their share to the contribution, and the system inaugurated at the time of these families had been continued ever since, and we know that Indians in South Africa never fail to send handsome contribution to India in times of national calamity Thus, service of the Indians in South Africa ever revealed to me new implications of truth in every stage Truth is like a vast tree, which yields more and more fruit, the more you nurture it. The deeper the search in the mine of truth, he richer the discovery of the gems buried there, in the shape of openings for an ever greater variety of service.

They have a lot of energy. You need to play with them oftenKittens will chew on almost anything they find. You have to watch them closely.12. Before clocks were made, people kept track of time by other means. In ancient Egypt, people used a water clock Water drippedslowly from one clay pot into another. People measured time according to how long it took one pot to empty and the other one tofill. Candle clocks were common during the Middle Ages. As such, when a candle burned, marks on its side showed about howmuch time had passed. A final ancient way to measure time was the sundial, which used the movement of the sun across the skyThe shadows moving across the face of the sundial showed the current time13. There are great numbers of deer around here. This whole area is great place for hunters and fishermen There are bears,mountain lions, and coyotes. To the east there are streams full of trout, and there are ducks and geese14. Advertising affects our lives every day. Brand names are common household words. We start each day using the toothpastesoap, and breakfast foods promoted by advertisers. Ads have made the cars we drive signs of our success Our choices of food,dress, and entertainment are swayed by ads.15. The physical environment of a classroom is extremely important. It can influence the way teachers and students feel, thmk, andbehave. If a student feels pressured, under stress, unhappy, or unsafe, it would be impossible for her or him to learn the lessonsplanned by the educator.

Afterwards, identify the problems/issues met by the author in his desire to improve his community by listing down the issues in the table provided then put a label what issue is it Sanitary Reform and Famine Relief by: M.K. Gandhi It has always been possible for me to reconcile myself to any one member of the body politic remaining out of use. I have always been loathe to hide or connive at the weak points of the community or to press for its rights without having purged it of its blemishes Therefore, ever since my settlement in Natal. I had been endeavoring to clear the community of a charge that had been leveled against it, not without a certain amount of truth The charge had often been made that the Indian was slovenly in his habits and did not keep his house and surroundings clean. The principal men of the community had, therefore, already begun to put their house in order, but house-to-house inspection was undertaken only when plague was reported to be imminent in Durban. This was done after consulting, and gaining the approval of the city fathers, who had desired our cooperation Our cooperation made work easier for them and at the same time lessened our hardships. For whenever there is an outbreak of epidemics, the executive, as a general rule, get impatient, take excessive measures and behave to such as may have incurred their displeasure with a heavy hand. The community saved itself from this oppression by voluntarily taking sanitary measures But I had some bitter experiences. I saw that I could not so easily count on the help of the community in getting it to do its own duty, as I could in claiming for its rights At some places I met with insults, at others with polite indifference. It was too much for people to bestir themselves to keep their surroundings clean Toe expect them to find money for the work was out of the question. These experiences taught me better than ever before, that without infinite patience it was impossible to get the people to do any work. It is the reformer who is anxious for the reform, and not the society, from which he should expect nothing better than opposition, abhorrence and even moral persecution Why may not society regard as retrogression what the reformers holds dear as life itself? Nevertheless, the result of this agitation was that Indian community learnt to recognize more or less the necessity for keeping their house and environments clean I gained the esteem of the authorities. They saw that, though I had made it my business to ventilate grievances and press rights, I was no less keen and insistent upon self-purification There was one thing, however, which still remained to be done, namely, the awakening in the Indian settler of a sense of duty to the motherland India was poor the Indian settler went to South Africa in search of wealth, and he was bound to contribute part off his earnings for the benefit of his countrymen in the hour of their adversity. This the settler did during the terrible famines of 1897 and 1899. They contributed handsomely for famine relief, and more so in 1899 than 1897 We had appealed to Englishmen also for funds, and they had responded well. Even the indentured Indians gave their share to the contribution, and the system inaugurated at the time of these families had been continued ever since, and we know that Indians in South Africa never fail to send handsome contribution to India in times of national calamity Thus, service of the Indians in South Africa ever revealed to me new implications of truth in every stage Truth is like a vast tree, which yields more and more fruit, the more you nurture it. The deeper the search in the mine of truth, he richer the discovery of the gems buried there, in the shape of openings for an ever greater variety of service.

You need to play with them oftenKittens will chew on almost anything they find. You have to watch them closely.12. Before clocks were made, people kept track of time by other means. In ancient Egypt, people used a water clock Water drippedslowly from one clay pot into another. People measured time according to how long it took one pot to empty and the other one tofill. Candle clocks were common during the Middle Ages. As such, when a candle burned, marks on its side showed about howmuch time had passed. A final ancient way to measure time was the sundial, which used the movement of the sun across the skyThe shadows moving across the face of the sundial showed the current time13. There are great numbers of deer around here. This whole area is great place for hunters and fishermen There are bears,mountain lions, and coyotes. To the east there are streams full of trout, and there are ducks and geese14. Advertising affects our lives every day. Brand names are common household words. We start each day using the toothpastesoap, and breakfast foods promoted by advertisers. Ads have made the cars we drive signs of our success Our choices of food,dress, and entertainment are swayed by ads.15. The physical environment of a classroom is extremely important. It can influence the way teachers and students feel, thmk, andbehave. If a student feels pressured, under stress, unhappy, or unsafe, it would be impossible for her or him to learn the lessonsplanned by the educator. Likewise, if a teacher feels unhappy or disorganized because of the classroom's lack of order or detail, theability for her to teach is greatly diminished.16. Apples can be used to make many delicious treats. Some people like to slice apples and dip them in caramel. Others like to cookthem and make them into apple jam. You might enjoy cutting apples and bake them into a pie or maybe you like to use freshlypicked apples to make fresh apple juice. Many people like to just pick apple and eat it right away.17. Chameleons change color for different reasons. They may change color to help their bodies adjust to changes in temperature oflight. They may also change colors depending on certain moods such as fear or excitement.18. Some kinds of bats eat many insects. Some bats can eat up to 600 mosquitoes in one hour. Bats are helpful to the environmentWithout bats, we would have too many insects.19 Sloths are the slowest mammals on earth. It takes a full minute for a sloth to move 6 feet across the ground You probablycouldn't move that slowly if you tried! The sloth's body is about 2 feet long. It has long legs, and curved claws that are 3 to 4 incheslong. Their claws and their long legs help them climb trees and hang from tree branches. They spend almost their entire liveshanging from tree branches.20. Exercise is crucial to our lives. Doctors recommend we exercise at least two times a week. Exercise does not necessarily need tobe done in the gym; it can consist of an outdoor walk or bike ride. It not only controls weight, but it combats many health conditionsand diseases. Another added benefit to exercise is its mood boosting qualities.​</h2><br />
