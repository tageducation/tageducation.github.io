                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1 two </p><p>2  tropical rainforest, tropical monsoon, tropical savanna, humid subtropical and oceanic</p><p>3 Using temperature and rainfall</p><p>4 a period of the year in some countries during which rain does not usually fall.</p><p>5 in ur community </p><p>6 </p><p>The pattern of human life in any particular region is to a very large extent determined by the climate.</p><p></p><p>Shelter:</p><p></p><p>The design of houses in different geographical regions of the world is determined by climatic conditions. In areas of heavy rainfall, the houses have sloping roofs. The material used in construction is, however, determined by the availability of construction material. The roof could be tiled or comprise bamboos covered with hay where clay for making tiles may not be available.</p><p></p><p>In dry regions like Rajasthan, flat stone pieces are used for roofing. Partition walls are made of wood in very cold countries. In regions of high temperature, there are open courtyards attached to each dwelling. In hill districts houses are made on stilts with the ground floor reserved for cattle.</p><p></p><p>Dress:</p><p></p><p>Loose dresses are popular in regions where the climate is hot. In colder regions, people wear dresses that are body hugging. A very wide variety of head gears is used again depending on the climate. The Sola hat was so popular with the British people living in the hot plains of India .Where rainfall is abundant people wear head gears that provide protection against rain while people are at work.</p><p></p><p>The lungi is popular in the southern regions of the country where it is relatively hot but not so in colder region as Himachal Pradesh. Woollens are worn in cold regions while cotton clothing is worn in hot and temperate regions. Synthetic clothing may be suitable in cold climates but not so at places where people perspire during the day.</p><p></p><p>Occupations:</p><p></p><p>During the winter months when outdoor living is not easy, the people of Kashmir remain indoors and follow up occupations like making carpets, handicrafts; silk wares that can be weaved sitting indoors. Agriculture is practiced where rainfall is adequate.</p><p></p><p>People living in dry regions follow pastoral occupations moving from place to place along with their herds of cattle looking for water and grass where ever it may be available. Where rainfall is abundant, forestry comes up as an important occupation for the people.</p><p></p><p>Art and Culture:</p><p></p><p>Open air stage performances are popular in areas that are not very cold. A wide variety exists at places where people have opportunity to remain out doors for most part of the year.</p><p></p><p>Food habits:</p><p></p><p>Since climate determines the nature of crops that can be grown in any part, the food habit also get influence by the climate. In Bengal, the staple food is rice since heavy rainfall in that region is most suited for paddy cultivation. The northern parts of the country, wheat are the staple diet. Millets are popular in dry regions like Rajasthan.</p><p></p><p>Crops like Bajra are grown there since this crop can survive even with scant water supply. The people living in Tundra region have no chance of being vegetarians. The climate does not allow growing any cereals or food crops.</p><p></p><p>Migration:</p><p></p><p>People living in extremely cold climates are known to migrate to warmer places in search of jobs. Where the climates are temperate, people tend to live a more settled life.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>this is the answer :)</p><p><strong>Questions:<br /></strong>1.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>1.twoUsing temperature and rainfall as bases, the climate of the country can be divided into two major seasons: (1) the rainy season, from June to November; and (2) the dry season, from December to May.2.The Philippines is a tropical country with only two seasons – a dry season and a wet season – but there are climatic variations within those seasons, and it can rain at any time of the year3.In summary, because the Philippines is in the tropical zone, the seasons are not determined by the amount of daylight. Rather, they are determined by the amount of rainfall, which varies throughout the year and from one part of the country to another because of seasonal variations in the prevailing wind patterns<br />
