                        <p>The color with the higher <strong>energy</strong> and <strong>frequency</strong> between green and orange is the color green. On the other hand, orange has a longer <strong>wavelength</strong> between the two.</p><p></p><p>Let us first identify the definition of the parameters energy, frequency, and wavelength based on the visible light spectrum.</p><p></p>Energy in this case refers to the light energy that is also considered a kinetic energy which helps the colors to be visible to our eyes.Frequency is the number of times a wave is completed.Wavelength is the length of the distance between to successive crests. The smaller the wave, the shorter the wavelength. The wavelength of visible light ranges from 380 nanometers to 700 nanometers.<p></p><p><strong>Why does green have higher energy and frequency?</strong></p><p>In the<strong> visible light spectrum</strong>, we have the colors of the rainbow: red, orange, yellow, green, violet, indigo, and blue. In the same order, the level of energy and frequency can be identified. Red has the lowest energy and frequency while blue has the highest energy and frequency.</p><p></p><p><strong>Why does orange has a longer wavelength?</strong></p><p>In principle, the higher the energy, the higher the frequency there will be as well. Simply put, the energy is <strong>directly proportiona</strong>l to the frequency. However, the frequency is <strong>inversely proportional</strong> to the wavelength.  The higher frequency we have, the shorter wavelengths there are. </p><p>Orange has longer wavelength since it is next to red which has the longest wavelength. The color green is in the middle part of the spectrum. Given their distance, orange has greater and longer wavelength.</p><p>                                                                                                 </p><p>If you want to learn more about electromagnetic waves, please visit https://brainly.ph/question/1170479</p><p></p><p>#SPJ2</p><br />
