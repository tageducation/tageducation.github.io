Kline                     Editor-in-Chief As our society gets better, kids get worst. Before 90's kids always respect and obey their parents. Now, when parents ask you to do something, you will just act like you did not hear them because you are busy on your mobile phones. Kids in this generation are always busy on their mobile phones.Some of them even stay up all night that affects the way they think. This is the probable reason why they disobey their parents. They tend to neglect what their parents are saying because they are focused on their gadgets. Another reason why kids disrespect is that they want more time to play than to study. Sometimes when their parents force them to study, they got mad. They even say bad words to their parents because they do not want to be disturbed. Parents and kids should respect each other. But kids need to obey or  their parents because their parents are their best friends for a lifetime. Parents somehow need to discipline their kids so they will learn how to respect them Kids, obey your parents Organize the details using the chart below.

In this chapter we provide some insights into children as learners. A study of young children fulfills two purposes: it illustrates the strengths and weaknesses of the learners who populate the nation’s schools, and it offers a window into the development of learning that cannot be seen if one considers only well-established learning patterns and expertise. In studying the development of children, an observer gets a dynamic picture of learning unfolding over time. A fresh understanding of infant cognition and of how young children from 2 to 5 years old build on that early start also sheds new light on how to ease their transition into formal school settings.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>sorry po but i really need a points</p><p><strong>Step-by-step explanation:</strong></p><p>hope you understand po</p><br />

Kline                     Editor-in-Chief As our society gets better, kids get worst. Before 90's kids always respect and obey their parents. Now, when parents ask you to do something, you will just act like you did not hear them because you are busy on your mobile phones. Kids in this generation are always busy on their mobile phones.Some of them even stay up all night that affects the way they think. This is the probable reason why they disobey their parents. They tend to neglect what their parents are saying because they are focused on their gadgets. Another reason why kids disrespect is that they want more time to play than to study. Sometimes when their parents force them to study, they got mad. They even say bad words to their parents because they do not want to be disturbed. Parents and kids should respect each other. But kids need to obey or  their parents because their parents are their best friends for a lifetime. Parents somehow need to discipline their kids so they will learn how to respect them Kids, obey your parents Organize the details using the chart below.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>       Perla, our new neighbor was in their kitchen on the evening of  the 4th day of Novembe  2018 to prepare their supper when she heard the strong thunder lightings branging outside along with the heavy rains. With just a glimpse of her eyes outside the window, she saw mountains of huge rocks falling from the distant hills.After what she saw, she hurriedly alarmed her parents and siblings. Together they run as fast as they could without even thinking of their things inside the house. As they were several meters away from their house, a big slashing rock from the mountain top exactly hit their home. </p><p></p><p>        After what had happened, and inspite of the fact that they have lost everything, they were still very thankful to God for not letting anything happen to anyone of them. They felt very sorry to those who hidiously  lost not just their homes but even their loved ones in that disaster. From that day on, they regularly volunteer to mass works to at least pay back the favour to those strangers who wholeheartedly helped them.</p><br />

How long have you been in a relationship before marriage?</p><p>- We've been 1 year in a relationship before marriage.</p><p>2. What is/are your memorable experience/s with your partner that make your relationship stronger?</p><p>- Just listening to one another and trying to understand how each other is feeling is a memorable experience that makes our relationship stronger. It doesn’t mean changing your own ideas or even necessarily admitting you’re wrong, but it just means that you show your partner that you care about how they’re feeling and that you’re willing to make the effort to meet in the middle if necessary.</p><p>3. What is/are the challenge/s had you experienced with your partner? How did you deal with it?</p><p>- Hmm.. Infidelity. That includes cheating and having emotional affairs. Infidelity happens when the connection in our relationship is not strong and can cause a breakdown of trust.
