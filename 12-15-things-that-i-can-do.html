                        ✏️ANSWER:✏️<p>1.<strong>When conducting research for your homework or project work, you’ll often come across sources of information that p</strong><strong> no</strong><strong>resent facts or opinions. I’ll be helping you to find out more about what they are and how to differentiate between them!</strong></p><p><strong>2</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>There are several different wa</strong><strong> up</strong><strong>ys that we know what we know, including informal observation, selective observation, overgeneralization, authority, and research methods. Research methods are a much more reliable source of knowledge than most of our other ways of knowing.</strong></p><p><strong>3</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>A lot of people live their lives having no clue what they want. They usually follow the American Dream without a second thought, just because that’s what’s expected of them.</strong></p><p><strong>4</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>According to Locke, knowledge of the external world is knowledge of 'real existence. ' Knowledge of real existence is knowledge that something really exists and is not a mere figment of your imagination. Locke argues that we can know three different kinds of things really exist.</strong></p><p><strong>5</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>"</strong><strong>Beauty is skin-deep” the saying goes, and it seems most of you agree when you describe what you consider most beautiful in a person. Confidence, kindness, happiness, dignity and intelligence all ranked in the top five out of 19 attributes that people said make the opposite and same sex beautiful.</strong></p><p><strong>6</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>The experience of aesthetic emotions can happen when a person perceives and evaluates a stimulus for its beautiful appeal or virtues. Aesthetic emotions are experienced through vision, hearing, touch, taste, smell and cognitive processing in response to respected stimuli</strong><strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>7</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>One view of emotional expression in art is that it is preceded by a perturbation or excitement from a vague cause about which the artist is uncertain and therefore anxious. The artist then proceeds to express feelings and ideas in words or paint or stone or the like, clarifying them and achieving a release of tension.</strong></p><p><strong>8</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>As visible religion, art communicates religious beliefs, customs, and values through iconography and depictions of the human body. The foundational principle for the interconnections between art and religion is the reciprocity between image making and meaning making as creative correspondence of humanity with divinity.</strong></p><p><strong>9</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>Among superstitions, one of the oldest and most enduring is that crossing paths with a black cat will bring on bad luck. The dark-colored felines have also been folded into modern Halloween symbols, giving them the (unearned) reputation of being spooky.</strong></p><p><strong>1</strong><strong>0</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>If you can satisfy yourself that the premises are true, perhaps because they are backed up by good sub-arguments, then you know that you have a good argument. If a premise is false or if it's not backed up by a good sub-argument, then the argument is </strong><strong>b</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>d</strong><strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>1</strong><strong>1</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>m</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>t</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>p</strong><strong>y</strong><strong>s</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>c</strong><strong>s</strong><strong>-</strong><strong>traditional branch of philosophy concerned with explaining the fundamental nature of being and the world that encompasses it, although the term is not easily defined. Traditionally, metaphysics attempts to answer two basic questions in the broadest possible terms</strong><strong>:</strong></p><p><strong>1</strong><strong>2</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>Believing that you control your own destiny means you have recognized your internal locus of control. It means you take responsibility for your thoughts and actions and their outcomes. By thinking this way, you can become unstoppable. You can learn how to control your destiny.</strong></p><p><strong>1</strong><strong>3</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>Thomas Aquinas took this view into Christianity. In Judaism and in some Christian denominations, (except for angels) only human beings have immortal souls (although immortality is disputed within Judaism and the concept of immortality may have been influenced by Plato).</strong></p><p><strong>1</strong><strong>4</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>Reality is the sum or aggregate of all that is real or existent within a system, as opposed to that which is only imaginary. The term is also used to refer to the ontological status of things, indicating their existence. In physical terms, reality is the totality of a system, known and unknown.</strong></p><p><strong>1</strong><strong>5</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>After Marcos was deposed in 1986, the newly drafted 1987 Constitution prohibited the death penalty but allowed the Congress to reinstate it "hereafter" for "heinous crimes"; making the Philippines the first Asian country to abolish capital punishment.</strong></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>hope its help</p><br />
