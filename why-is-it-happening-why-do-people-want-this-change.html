                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.An oven is the most important processing step in the baking industry for several reasons: It is the workhorse of the bakery. ... Baking in the oven is the step that imparts the final characteristics to the products (e.g., shelf life, flavor, texture, color, aroma).</p><p>2.If you would prefer to drink your ice cream as a liquid then you can put it in the fridge. How quickly this happens will depend on the temperature of the fridge and the size of the ice cream container. In terms of it remaining safe to eat, I would think it would last longer than milk but not as long as yogurt.</p><p>3.</p><p>4</p><p>5.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>sorry d ko alam Yung tatlo at least may answer Yung dalawa:)</p><p>pa brainliest na din pow❤</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>That’s right, we like change.  Without change many of us would be out of a job or a business.  The world changes and we need to learn to change along with it….not to far in front, but enough that we can take advantage of new things as they come down the pike.</p><p></p><p>Change is often seen as a problem.  It always requires us to do things a little bit differently and often causes some inconvenience.  It’s the inconvenience or un-comfortableness that often keeps from making the changes we need to make.</p><p></p><p>I personally like change.  Change has brought many great things to my life.  Deciding to leave Washington, DC and go to Boston to college was a great change.  Leaving the vending business and going into the financial services was good for me.  Going from being single to married was a great change.  We all experience change.  It’s what we do with it that makes it a good or bad thing</p><br />
