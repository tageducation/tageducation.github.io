Other places might get less rain.Some places might have stronger hurricanes.Based on the evidence, more than 97% of climatescientists have concluded that human-caused climate change ishappening Climate change is already causing significantimpacts to people and ecosystems, and these impacts will growmuch more severe in the coming years.vve can choose to take economically sensible steps tolessen the damage of climate change, and the cost of inaction ismuch higher than the cost of action.Summarize the information you read answering the followingquestions to help you identify the key points.

Oceans would rise higher. Some places would get hotter.Other places might have colder winters with more snow. Someplaces might get more rain. Other places might get less rain.Some places might have stronger hurricanes.Based on the evidence, more than 97% of climatescientists have concluded that human-caused climate change ishappening Climate change is already causing significantimpacts to people and ecosystems, and these impacts will growmuch more severe in the coming years.vve can choose to take economically sensible steps tolessen the damage of climate change, and the cost of inaction ismuch higher than the cost of action.Summarize the information you read answering the followingquestions to help you identify the key points.
