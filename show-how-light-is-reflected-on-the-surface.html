                                            INTRODUCTION:RefractionIt refers to the bending of light as it passes through different materials.ReflectionIt refers to the bouncing back of light when it hits an object. Some objects withflat surfaces like mirrors, reflect light in a straight, predictable way. Some objects withuneven surfaces like rocks, reflect light in a scattered way.AbsorptionIt refers to materials taking in light but not reflecting it back.TransmissionIt refers to the passing of light through some materials.SITUATIONIn this activity , you will create a journal that records how the light absorb, reflect, refract and transmit.INSTRUCTION:1. Look around your room to find examples of items (mediums) that transmit,reflect, refract, and absorb. Write it down in your supposed journal (paper)2. After you visit and interact with those materials, they can add another item inthe house.3. Go over how lights behaves with each item.4. Write all your observations through a paper.Guided Questions:1.

                            13. INTRODUCTION:RefractionIt refers to the bending of light as it passes through different materials.ReflectionIt refers to the bouncing back of light when it hits an object. Some objects withflat surfaces like mirrors, reflect light in a straight, predictable way. Some objects withuneven surfaces like rocks, reflect light in a scattered way.AbsorptionIt refers to materials taking in light but not reflecting it back.TransmissionIt refers to the passing of light through some materials.SITUATIONIn this activity , you will create a journal that records how the light absorb, reflect, refract and transmit.INSTRUCTION:1. Look around your room to find examples of items (mediums) that transmit,reflect, refract, and absorb. Write it down in your supposed journal (paper)2. After you visit and interact with those materials, they can add another item inthe house.3. Go over how lights behaves with each item.4. Write all your observations through a paper.Guided Questions:1.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. In the water cycle, evaporation occurs when sunlight warms the surface of the water. The heat from the sun makes the water molecules move faster and faster, until they move so fast they escape as a gas. Once evaporated, a molecule of water vapor spends about ten days in the air.</p><p>2.Light refracts whenever it travels at an angle into a substance with a different refractive index (optical density). This change of direction is caused by a change in speed. For example, when light travels from air into water, it slows down, causing it to continue to travel at a different angle or direction.</p><p>3.The effect when the glass was held at different heights and angles is called refraction. Refraction is the bending of light as it passes from one transparent medium into another. It can also happens with sound, water and other waves.</p><p>4. When light that is traveling through the air hits water, some of the light is reflected off the water. The rest of the light passes through the water but it bends (or refracts) as it enters the water. The same thing happens when light hits glass or any other transparent material.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>there.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Luster describes the reflection of light off a mineral's surface. Mineralogists have special terms to describe luster. One simple way to classify luster is based on whether the mineral is metallic or non-metallic. Minerals that are opaque and shiny, such as pyrite, have a metallic luster.</p><br />
