BIG SISTER by Consorcio Borjeto
The eighteen-year-old big sister, Inciang helps the twelve-year-old brother prepare his stuff for the travel to Vigan. In the process, Inciang recalls her hardship in tending to the needs of her only brother. Their mother has passed away giving birth to the brother of Inciang so she acts as the

mother to Itong. The father never married again and spends his time tilling their land and help in the everyday sustenance of the family. Itong needs to go to school and being a valedictorian graduate in the barrio elementary school, there is a need for him to pursue not only his dream but more so of the dreams of the family members for him become a doctor or a lawyer. Inciang feels in pain soon being apart from her brother for the first time. The rest of the family and more of Inciang display support, love, concern, care for Itong. He left the first time and the rest of the neighbourhood tend up to the bus station. Inciang is in so much emotional pain seeing his brother leave for Vigan but she displayed firm attitude as everyone bids the boy goodbye. A year has passed and Itong returns to the barrio. He displays eagerness to see his old friends and Inciang notices everything. Few more years and Itong has grown taller and bigger, simultaneously he has changed in a way that he is no longer very tactile to his sister. Inciang is affected and she observes more yet accepting that change is indeed inevitable. The family needs to live a life despite the changes and Nena comes to the scene, someone whom she feels could be her sister.</a>

Itong needs to go to school and being a valedictorian graduate in the barrio elementary school, there is a need for him to pursue not only his dream but more so of the dreams of the family members for him become a doctor or a lawyer. Inciang feels in pain soon being apart from her brother for the first time. The rest of the family and more of Inciang display support, love, concern, care for Itong. He left the first time and the rest of the neighbourhood tend up to the bus station. Inciang is in so much emotional pain seeing his brother leave for Vigan but she displayed firm attitude as everyone bids the boy goodbye. A year has passed and Itong returns to the barrio. He displays eagerness to see his old friends and Inciang notices everything. Few more years and Itong has grown taller and bigger, simultaneously he has changed in a way that he is no longer very tactile to his sister. Inciang is affected and she observes more yet accepting that change is indeed inevitable. The family needs to live a life despite the changes and Nena comes to the scene, someone whom she feels could be her sister.</h2><br />

He left the first time and the rest of the neighbourhood tend up to the bus station. Inciang is in so much emotional pain seeing his brother leave for Vigan but she displayed firm attitude as everyone bids the boy goodbye. A year has passed and Itong returns to the barrio. He displays eagerness to see his old friends and Inciang notices everything. Few more years and Itong has grown taller and bigger, simultaneously he has changed in a way that he is no longer very tactile to his sister.
