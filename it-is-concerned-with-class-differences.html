                                            1. The enforcement of shifting scheme in classes in Luis Palad Integrated High School is aggravating as it hampers the progress of the class. It has also raised some considerations and concerns that are of course, worth noting. To accommodate the big turnout of enrollees, Paladians had to follow different schedules that eventually led to shifting in classes where students have to be divided to morning and afternoon sessions. The shifting scheme enables schools to accept more students and educate them in less crowded conditions as well as provide them with greater access to education. However, more than 6 hours of studying is quite overwhelming for them to catch up on all of their lessons and to shape their learning experiences. - “Slip of the Tongue” by Karylle Anne Cabuyao.​</a>

                                            As governments ease out of lockdowns, we will begin to see schools adopting the blended learning approach. Those who are necessitated to move to online learning during the Covid-19 crisis will start to realize the full benefits of virtual education as teachers and students return to their physical classrooms. The conscious and careful blending of face-to- face instruction and online methods can draw the best of both worlds and create the best teaching and learning experience. Some schools will also start combining blended learning with a flipped classroom approach. In a flipped classroom, the typical classroom lecture and homework elements are reversed. At home, the students watch short video lectures and other asynchronous content, while activities traditionally assigned as homework are now done in-class with the teacher answering student questions and helping them apply course concepts during class time. 1. What is common between the two approaches? 2. How does each approach differ as far as learning instructions are concerned? 3. Between the two approaches, which do you find better? Why?​</a>

Sociologists recognize the importance of socialization for healthy individual and societal development Scholars are using these three major theoretical paradigms to approach this topic. Sociological Perspective on Socialization . • Structural functionalists would say that socialization is essential to society, both because it trains members to operate successfully within it and because it perpetuates culture by transmitting it to new generations. Without socialization, a society's culture would perish as members died off. Structural Functionalism • A conflict theorist might argue that socialization reproduces inequality from generation to generation by conveying different expectations and norms to those with different social characteristics. For example, individuals are socialized differently by gender, social class, and race. As in Chris Langan's case, this creates different (unequal) opportunities. Conflict Perspective An interactionist studying socialization is concerned with face-to-face exchanges and symbolic communication. For example, dressing baby boys in blue and baby girls in pink is one small way we convey messages about differences in gender roles. Symbolic Interactionism​</a>

                            13. 1. The enforcement of shifting scheme in classes in Luis Palad Integrated High School is aggravating as it hampers the progress of the class. It has also raised some considerations and concerns that are of course, worth noting. To accommodate the big turnout of enrollees, Paladians had to follow different schedules that eventually led to shifting in classes where students have to be divided to morning and afternoon sessions. The shifting scheme enables schools to accept more students and educate them in less crowded conditions as well as provide them with greater access to education. However, more than 6 hours of studying is quite overwhelming for them to catch up on all of their lessons and to shape their learning experiences. - “Slip of the Tongue” by Karylle Anne Cabuyao.​</h2><br />

                            24. As governments ease out of lockdowns, we will begin to see schools adopting the blended learning approach. Those who are necessitated to move to online learning during the Covid-19 crisis will start to realize the full benefits of virtual education as teachers and students return to their physical classrooms. The conscious and careful blending of face-to- face instruction and online methods can draw the best of both worlds and create the best teaching and learning experience. Some schools will also start combining blended learning with a flipped classroom approach. In a flipped classroom, the typical classroom lecture and homework elements are reversed. At home, the students watch short video lectures and other asynchronous content, while activities traditionally assigned as homework are now done in-class with the teacher answering student questions and helping them apply course concepts during class time. 1.

You have to read and understand these concepts and answer the activities afterwards, Write your answer on a separate sheet of paper. Sociologists recognize the importance of socialization for healthy individual and societal development Scholars are using these three major theoretical paradigms to approach this topic. Sociological Perspective on Socialization . • Structural functionalists would say that socialization is essential to society, both because it trains members to operate successfully within it and because it perpetuates culture by transmitting it to new generations. Without socialization, a society's culture would perish as members died off. Structural Functionalism • A conflict theorist might argue that socialization reproduces inequality from generation to generation by conveying different expectations and norms to those with different social characteristics. For example, individuals are socialized differently by gender, social class, and race. As in Chris Langan's case, this creates different (unequal) opportunities. Conflict Perspective An interactionist studying socialization is concerned with face-to-face exchanges and symbolic communication.

You have to read and understand these concepts and answer the activities afterwards, Write your answer on a separate sheet of paper. Sociologists recognize the importance of socialization for healthy individual and societal development Scholars are using these three major theoretical paradigms to approach this topic. Sociological Perspective on Socialization . • Structural functionalists would say that socialization is essential to society, both because it trains members to operate successfully within it and because it perpetuates culture by transmitting it to new generations. Without socialization, a society's culture would perish as members died off. Structural Functionalism • A conflict theorist might argue that socialization reproduces inequality from generation to generation by conveying different expectations and norms to those with different social characteristics. For example, individuals are socialized differently by gender, social class, and race. As in Chris Langan's case, this creates different (unequal) opportunities.

She was kept close to a lit candle in the heat of the afternoon sun. She was sprinkled with large quantities of sacred water, sacred perfume, fragrant scents, and scented water. She was sprayed with so much of these liquids that by the wee end of the ceremony, the cat was dripping wet and in a terrible state, and appeared to the writer as being helpless and forlorn. She was paraded about the temple, then the marketplace, and back again to the temple through the same route. During the procession, she was continuously being drenched with perfumes and scented water. She was getting disturbed by the noise of the people, the chanting of the Buddhist monks, and the beating of the sacred drums.. so i would bet that the owner felt horrible.</p><br />

                            30. Jane, Marie, Juliet and Rose are good friends. All of them are 13 years old and love to spend time with one another. They have so much to talk about the new film, the new dress, homework, the boys in the class and just about everything. Yesterday, Rose seemed uncomfortable. She was having her periods and was concerned about staining her uniform. Rose recollected that 3 months ago, Jane, Marie and Juliet had started her periods. Rose is worried. Except her, all her friends had started their periods. Was something wrong with her? Questions: 1 if rose came to you for a adivce ,what would you tell her as a peer?? 2 in your opinion, who should be responsible for sensitizing adolescents about the fact that it is natural for different people to attain maturity at different times? 3 Do you think it is important for young people to be prepared for the changes that they are likely to face in adolescence? why? ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1) If rose came to me for advice, I would tell her to not feel left out, because everybody's different. Just because you're period came a bit late that doesn't mean you are less than me or other girls. Having your menstruation for the first time is hard, but think of it as a way your body cleanses itself. There should be no shame on having your period, you'll get used to it later on. </p><p></p><p>2) In my opinion, it is the parents who is responsible for sensitizing their children, because they are the only ones that their child truly trust. </p><p></p><p>3) Of course it is extremely important to prepare them for the changes that they will face, so that they will know what to do when it happens. </p><br />
