                                            The interaction between the Self and the other is related to the philosophical concept of intersubjectivity Similar to the word interpersonal, the word intersubjectivity is also comprise of three groups of letters and/or words, namely a inter = again this is a prefix which means 'between b subject = this refers to a person or thing that is being discussed with city = a suffix used to form nouns which expresses state or condition From this, we can conclude that intersubjectivity means a condition of relationship between subjects or persons. If I relate with a friend for example, and he or she relates back to me, intersubjectivity occurs Philosophically, this means that when the Self recognizes the Other and the other recognizes the Self, intersubjectivity happens.

______________6. Blumer’s idea of symbolic interactionism is that thing exist independent from humans and that its‟
meaning is universal or the same to all mankind.

______________8. The negotiated order is the existing system of expected behavior whenever we enter interaction with
others.
______________9. The uniqueness of an individual or the self is a product of society because the state of uniqueness is
always trying to impress the others and thus share the same foundation with the social world.
______________10. According to Blumer the meaning of phenomenon may vary from humans and the meaning will
remain the same once it is interpreted by the individual who encountered it.</a>
