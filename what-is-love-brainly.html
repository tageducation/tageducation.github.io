The Monkey who was a Prince
Prince Ucay was a tall and handsome prince. He was kind and gentle to everyone, including the birds
and animals. He learned to speak the language of his animal friends.
A witch fell in love with Prince Ucay. But no matter what she did to make him love her, Prince Ucay
know her evil plans. The witch became very angry. She changed Prince Ucay into a monkey. She also
changed his people into monkeys and the houses in the village into trees.
Years later, a village grew near Ucay's village. A church was built, and the witch fled away. The people
were unkind to Ucay, which made him very unhappy. They stoned him and drove him away.
One morning, Ucay saw a lovely young girl walk out of the church toward the tree where he was sitting.
The girl wept and wept. Ucay felt pity for her. He was crying in sympathy for her. He put his hand on her
head to comfort her. The girl was frightened upon seeing a monkey. But she felt the kindness in him. She
spoke to him and offered to treat his wounds. Ucay changed into a handsome prince that he was. The witch's
spell was broken. Ucay's village became alive again. Not long after, a royal wedding took place.

The lesson of this story is the importance of trust. To have love, there must be trust. It’s not easy to trust, but it’s necessary in a loving relationship. We may not even experience what Orpheus experienced, but most of us will face a moment of “hell” where our love will be tested and only trust can save us. The story also teaches us to have patience and wait.

The Monkey who was a Prince
Prince Ucay was a tall and handsome prince. He was kind and gentle to everyone, including the birds
and animals. He learned to speak the language of his animal friends.
A witch fell in love with Prince Ucay. But no matter what she did to make him love her, Prince Ucay
know her evil plans. The witch became very angry. She changed Prince Ucay into a monkey. She also
changed his people into monkeys and the houses in the village into trees.
Years later, a village grew near Ucay's village. A church was built, and the witch fled away. The people
were unkind to Ucay, which made him very unhappy. They stoned him and drove him away.
One morning, Ucay saw a lovely young girl walk out of the church toward the tree where he was sitting.
The girl wept and wept. Ucay felt pity for her. He was crying in sympathy for her. He put his hand on her
head to comfort her. The girl was frightened upon seeing a monkey. But she felt the kindness in him. She
spoke to him and offered to treat his wounds. Ucay changed into a handsome prince that he was. The witch's
spell was broken. Ucay's village became alive again. Not long after, a royal wedding took place.

(smart and anything) it not important to use brainly if you dont no but brain love our stuff</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The brain is the center of the nervous system. It interprets stimuli and tells the body how to react. The brain has three major parts. The part that controls balance, coordination and muscle movement is called the cerebellum. It makes sure that the muscles work well together. For example, a gymnast is able to balance on a beam because of the cerebellum. The medulla is a long stem that connects the brain to the spinal cord. It tells one’s body to do things without thinking about them. Digesting food or breathing even while asleep are examples of these involuntary actions. On the other hand, there are actions that one decides to do. It is the largest part of the brain—the cerebrum—that is responsible for these voluntary movements. Without it, one will not be able to kick a ball or dance at all. The brain might seem small but it is so powerful as it controls one’s entire body. Questions 1. Which is the best description of the brain? a. It makes people intelligent. b. It keeps one’s body healthy. c. It helps everyone think well. d. It dictates how the body will react to stimuli. 2. In the sentence, “The brain interprets stimuli,” the meaning of interpret is a. assign roles b. recall facts c. discuss ideas d. make sense of 3.

The lesson of this story is the importance of trust. To have love, there must be trust. It’s not easy to trust, but it’s necessary in a loving relationship. We may not even experience what Orpheus experienced, but most of us will face a moment of “hell” where our love will be tested and only trust can save us. The story also teaches us to have patience and wait.
