Fill in the missing boxes with the appropriate information 1. Fernando Amorsolo (1892-1972) is often known as the "Grand Old Man of Philippine Art". The Spanish-trained realist developed a backlighting technique, where his colorful depictions of local people reflect the radiance of the Philippine sun. The figures and illuminated landscapes magically glow on the canvas Despite his deteriorating health and failing eyesight, he remained prolific until the end, producing up to 10 paintings a month until his death at the age of 80. Amorsolo's creativity defines the nation's culture and heritage to this day.pa help po plsss ​</a>

Rice Terraces of the Philippine Cordilleras- Outstanding Universal Value The Rice Terraces of the Philippines Cordilleras are an outstanding example of a developed, living cultural landscape. They can be traced as far back as two millennia ago in the precolonici Philippines. They are found in the remote areas of the Philippine Cordillera mountain range on the northern island of Luzon, Philippine archipelago. These historic terraces cover an extensive area. The property consists of five clusters of the most intact and impressive terraces located in four municipalities. They are all the products of Ifugao ethnic group, a minority community that has lived on these mountains for thousands of years. The Ifugao Rice Terraces are an ideal example of a living cultural landscape of beauty beyond compare. The Ifugao Rice Terraces are valuable contributions of our ancestors to mankind. They were built 2,000 years ago and passed on through generations and an example of an ancient civilization that overcame challenges passed by modemization. Built on steeper lopes of high mountains and the careful carving of the natural shapes of the hills, the Ifugco Rice Terrace have complex imigation systems. Water comes from the forests of the mountain tops. The maintenance of the living rice terraces shows that the whole community works as one. It is based on the knowledge of the rich variety of biological resources which exist in the Ifugao Agri- ecosystem.- Castillo, K.E. (2016). Joy in Learning English 5. Vibal Group, Inc Questions: 1.

                                            The Philippines is considered a melting pot which is a place where people of different races, religion, beliefs, and tradition blend together as one. This diverse and varied culture makes Filipinos unique from the rest of the world. Filipinos give much importance to their values. Despite of the modern influence, they still retain their traditional practices. One of their trademarks is hospitality like welcoming the guests with a big smile and treating them warmly. In times of challenges and catastrophies, they don’t easily give up as resilience is one of their traits. 1.  Did you enjoy reading the text? ​</a>

                                            Why Pinoy students ranked last in reading comprehension surveyMANILA - Filipino students ranked last among 79 countries in a global survey of reading comprehension because they are more used to narrative instead of informative text materials, a group said Thursday:Frederick Sotto Perez, president of the Reading Association of the Philippines, said this was the first time that the country joined the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).The country joined the global survey which will provide us baseline data for our curriculum," he said. "The texts in the exam) are mainly informational and the evaluation of the text and understanding revolved on informational text and not narrative, to which our students are used to in the Philippines," Perez told ANC's Early Edition"People are alarmed by the results. This alarm may lead us to a more reflective education which we went to pursue."Perez said children should be taught expository texts that focus on factual information, at the age of 9."Reading ability is developed through practice. We can only develop fluent readers if we provide them with text, print and digital, and we practice them through teacher modeling, shared practice towards independent practice, he said.Another reason for Filipino students tenking last in the exam is poor connectivity in far-flung areas, Perez said, noting that the country "lacks reading materials." There's no internet, boolas are mainly children's books, and there are noencyclopedias and other digital texts," he said."Books and printed text are very essential. Reading culture may be promoted in schools through extended literacy projects, book talks of teachers. Schools should be active in fostering a reading culture by actually making their libraries functional."Students must also be taught to discern the credibility of a text which was one aspect that PISA tested, Perez added."I think it's important we know how to evaluate sources, that is being taught in high school, check the facts and actually cross-check," he said."Even in social media, for example, we see our students always sharing online without discerning what kind of texts they are sharing with other people."Teachers and parents must also be guided in handling digital literacy Perez said as he emphasized that all educators should be "reading teachers.""All teachers should undergo reading instruction strategy training. Our students to be able to do research should know how to read articles and facts, evaluate them, citation, distinguishing fact from opinion," he said."But if our teachers for example in science, social studies, or math are not equipped in helping our students develop those skills, the blame goes to our reading teachers."what is your personal opinion towards the subject of the new article? cite you belief or opinions why you think filipino students ranked last in the reading comprehension survey.​</a>

Rhodelyn was going to watch for the first time a musical play The Beauty and the Beast" at the Cultural Center of the Philippines theater. The problem was that Rhodelyn didn't know much about the presentation. So, to solve her dilemma, she took some action. First, she went to the library and read about musical plays. Then she borrowed a book in which she could read about "The Beauty and the Beast." Little did she know that her best friend's aunt was a stage performer. So, she met her to personally ask about the play. After accomplishing all of these, she confidently watched the play with her friends and was very appreciative of the opportunity.​</a>

This diverse and varied culture makes Filipinos unique from the rest of the world. Filipinos give much importance to their values. Despite of the modern influence, they still retain their traditional practices. One of their trademarks is hospitality like welcoming the guests with a big smile and treating them warmly. In times of challenges and catastrophies, they don’t easily give up as resilience is one of their traits. 1.  Did you enjoy reading the text? ​</h2><br />

                            13. Why Pinoy students ranked last in reading comprehension surveyMANILA - Filipino students ranked last among 79 countries in a global survey of reading comprehension because they are more used to narrative instead of informative text materials, a group said Thursday:Frederick Sotto Perez, president of the Reading Association of the Philippines, said this was the first time that the country joined the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).The country joined the global survey which will provide us baseline data for our curriculum," he said. "The texts in the exam) are mainly informational and the evaluation of the text and understanding revolved on informational text and not narrative, to which our students are used to in the Philippines," Perez told ANC's Early Edition"People are alarmed by the results. This alarm may lead us to a more reflective education which we went to pursue."Perez said children should be taught expository texts that focus on factual information, at the age of 9."Reading ability is developed through practice. We can only develop fluent readers if we provide them with text, print and digital, and we practice them through teacher modeling, shared practice towards independent practice, he said.Another reason for Filipino students tenking last in the exam is poor connectivity in far-flung areas, Perez said, noting that the country "lacks reading materials." There's no internet, boolas are mainly children's books, and there are noencyclopedias and other digital texts," he said."Books and printed text are very essential. Reading culture may be promoted in schools through extended literacy projects, book talks of teachers. Schools should be active in fostering a reading culture by actually making their libraries functional."Students must also be taught to discern the credibility of a text which was one aspect that PISA tested, Perez added."I think it's important we know how to evaluate sources, that is being taught in high school, check the facts and actually cross-check," he said."Even in social media, for example, we see our students always sharing online without discerning what kind of texts they are sharing with other people."Teachers and parents must also be guided in handling digital literacy Perez said as he emphasized that all educators should be "reading teachers.""All teachers should undergo reading instruction strategy training. Our students to be able to do research should know how to read articles and facts, evaluate them, citation, distinguishing fact from opinion," he said."But if our teachers for example in science, social studies, or math are not equipped in helping our students develop those skills, the blame goes to our reading teachers."what is your personal opinion towards the subject of the new article? cite you belief or opinions why you think filipino students ranked last in the reading comprehension survey.​</h2><br />

Then she borrowed a book in which she could read about "The Beauty and the Beast." Little did she know that her best friend's aunt was a stage performer.

When it was shown on television,most teens at the time were eager to go home to watch the episodes. Sincethen, various Asian dramas have been emerging and presently, Koreandramas are one of the most popular in Asia, if not around the world. Manychildren, teens, and even adults have adored Korean dramas since thesewere introduced in the Philippines in 2000s.Filipinos have always been welcoming of foreign trends and culture. Assuch, Korean culture and trends as seen in Korean dramas have invaded andbeen deeply rooted in the Philippine society today. Korean dramas havegreatly influenced the food, fashion, cosmetics, music, and entertainmentindustries, as well as people's views and preferences.Write a stand on the influence of Korean culture in the Philippines. State yoursupport or disagreement in 3-5 sentences. (Use the rubric in scoring your output.)​</h2><br />
                        <strong>Answer:</strong><strong></strong>K-Dramas widely influenced Filipinos and I don't think there is anything wrong with that except that some people are starting to neglect their own country, claiming that the other is better. Also, when people start to acknowledge the products of the other country than ours which causes our economy to slowly go down. But still, K-Dramas' influence upon us is more on positivity. For example, people in our country start to learn and try more different dressing or clothing style, but we should not forget our own tradition of clothing. Also, some people tend to give more care to their physical appearance more including the use of products from the country, and also the act of styling our hairs based on a Korean perm. And most of all, our music has been greatly influenced by their artists which is not really a problem as long as you still acknowledge our own country's as well. Despite some of these big changes, I hope that our people still love our own country as much as our (Philippine) heroes did.<p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>HOPE THIS HELPS</strong></p><p><strong>#PhilippinesLovesKorea</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Korean culture has become a part of many Filipinos’ lives. KPOP has become a trend among young people.
