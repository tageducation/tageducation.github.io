                                            "The Road Not Taken" By Robert Frost Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, And sorry I could not travel both And be one traveler, long I stood And looked down one as far as I could To where it bent in the undergrowth; Then took the other, as just as fair, And having perhaps the better claim Because it was grassy and wanted wear, Though as for that the passing there Had worn them really about the same, And both that morning equally lay In leaves no step had trodden black. Oh, marked the first for another day! Yet knowing how way leads on to way I doubted if I should ever come back. I shall be telling this with a sigh Somewhere ages and ages hence: Two roads diverged in a wood, and I, I took the one less traveled by And that has made all the difference.

                                            Please read this text afterwards, answer the questions that follows.
 There are six types of peer pressure and tips for parents to help their child
make healthy, life-long choices:
1.Spoken peer pressure is when a teenager asks, suggests, persuades, or
otherwise directs another to engage in a specific behavior. If the spoken
influence takes place within a group, the pressure to go along with the group
is immense. 
2. With unspoken peer pressure, a teenager is exposed to the actions of one
or more peers and is left to choose whether they want to follow along. This
could take the form of fashion choices, personal interactions or ‘joining’
types of behavior (clubs, teams, etc). Many young teens lack the mental
maturity to control impulses and make wise long-term decisions. 
3. Direct peer pressure can be spoken or unspoken. It is normally behavior
centric. Examples of these kinds of behavior would be when a teenager
hands another teen an alcoholic drink, or make a sexual advance, or looks
at another student’s paper during a test. The other student is put in a
position of having to make an on-the-spot decision. 
4. Like unspoken peer pressure, indirect peer pressure is subtle but can still
exert a strong influence on an impressionable young person. When a teen
overhears a friend gossiping about another person and then reacts to the
gossip, that is indirect peer pressure. 
5. Asking a teenager to engage in behavior that is against his/her moral
code or family values is a type of negative peer pressure. Teens see the
actions of other teens with stronger personalities and are put in a position of
following the leader or walking away. Young people often lack the skills to
say no to negative peer pressure. 
6. A group of dynamic can be a positive peer influence if the behaviors are

                            9. "The Road Not Taken" By Robert Frost Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, And sorry I could not travel both And be one traveler, long I stood And looked down one as far as I could To where it bent in the undergrowth; Then took the other, as just as fair, And having perhaps the better claim Because it was grassy and wanted wear, Though as for that the passing there Had worn them really about the same, And both that morning equally lay In leaves no step had trodden black. Oh, marked the first for another day! Yet knowing how way leads on to way I doubted if I should ever come back. I shall be telling this with a sigh Somewhere ages and ages hence: Two roads diverged in a wood, and I, I took the one less traveled by And that has made all the difference.

And that was the biggest mistáke I have ever done in my entire life, I purchased an amount of ₱20,000+. Two months later, my father asked me why is the bank contacting him saying, "You have a due of ₱28,000 ...", and I froze and don't know what to do. Ten months later, he got home from work and knowing what I did and he rebuked me. It was so tèrrifying and that day I learned a lesson, " do not be so ambitious in life, or you'll pay it in the future". Does the outcome favórable? Yes, because I learned from it. Also, no, because I wásted a lot of móney.</p><p></p>Learning Task 11) What is the moral conveyed in the poem? Is it explicit or implicit? Explain.<p>The moral conveyed in the poem is that "trust the way you believe". Well, as I read the poem, it is implicit. Because it explains what he decided or his choice in the poem.</p>2) What does the poem say about human nature when it comes to decision-making?<p>Do not let anything keep you from deciding what you believe, just continue what you started and you'll get the best result.</p>3) How does this poem remind you of the personal choices that you made before?<p>It is so mindful and it helps me aware of something that I decided to chose.</p>4) In your point of view, do you think the speaker in the poem is happy about his choice? Why or why not?<p>For me, yes, he chooses what he believes and thinks he can complete it.</p>5) What are the chances that the speaker will get to come back and try the other path?<p>It relies on the problems and situations. Every one of us has our decision-making problem. Am I right?</p><p></p><p><strong>#BrainliestBunch</strong></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>
</p><p>Directions: After reading the poem, answer these questions. Write your answer on your pad paper.
</p><p>1. Why is the poem entitled “The Road Not Taken”?
</p><p>Because the poem isn't “The Road less Traveled.” It's “The Road Not Taken.” And the road not taken, of course, is the road one didn't take—which means that the title passes over the “less traveled” road the speaker claims to have followed in order to foreground the road he never tried.
</p><p>2. What attitude of the speaker is revealed by choosing the road less traveled by?
</p><p>Individualism, by choosing the less-traveled path over the well-traveled path, the speaker suggests that he or she values individualism over conformity.
</p><p>3. What do you think would have happened had the traveler made a different choice?
</p><p>For me, I think he would be unhappy because he didn’t choose the path that he really wanted, but it’s his choice even if he regrets it he can’t bring back the time and change his choice anyway.
</p><p>4. Does this choice influence his behavior in life? Why?
</p><p>In the poem, the poet has a choice of traveling on two roads. ... The choice he made, made a difference in his life. Another choice might be if you want to join a gang or go your own way. That choice would definitely affect your behavior.
</p><p>5. How would you decide if you were in the same situation?
</p><p>I would choose the same path because I want to do the things that will make me happy even if it’s not the path that many chose.
</p><p>6. Recall a time when you had to make a difficult decision. Do you think you made the right choice? Was the outcome favorable or not?
</p><p>There was a time when I was forced to choose a section in Grade 10, the other section is where my old friends are, while the other is where I think it will be good for me, I chose the one that I think is best for me even though my old friends are not there.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>1.<strong>Because the poem isn't “The Road Less Traveled.” It's “The Road Not Taken.” And the road not taken, of course, is the road one didn't take—which means that the title passes over the “less traveled” road the speaker claims to have followed in order to foreground the road he never tried.</strong></p><p></p><p>2.<strong>The two roads symbolize the choices that one has to make in life.

Do you think youmade the night choice? Was the outcome favorable or not?​​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>1. The title of "The Road Not Taken" refers to times when we look back at important choices and wonder what would have happened if we had decided differently. 2. The attitude of the speaker that is revealed by his claim to have taken the road less traveled is one of peace, optimism, self-importance, or even self-mockery. The speaker reveals in earlier stanzas that the two roads are "about the same," yet he recognizes that as he looks back on this choice in the future, he will wish to believe and tell others that his decision "made all the difference."3. I think the purpose of the poem is to make the reader consider the impact of decisions made during life. My interpretation of what will happen as a result of the poet's decision to take the road less traveled isn't as important as that every reader finds his/her own meaning.4. I think one way of interpreting the poem is to say that he took the less traveled road both figuratively and literally.  In life, he chose to do things that other people were not doing.  You can interpret the "difference" he says it has made in his life as either positive or negative, but most people assume it is positive.5. No matter which road is chosen it "will make all the difference" just as every decision we make "makes a difference" to alarge or small degree.  The difference can be positive or negative, but all of our choices affect us in some way.  Large decisions like where to go to college or what job to take may affect where we live, who we meet and how we live.  Small decisions like what we eat may affect how we feel later that day.  In the end, all of our choices have consequences.6. Yes, All we have to do is to trust on ourselves, make the decision, and believe that we are going to choose. <p></p><p>This the answer po. </p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Why is the poem entitled “The Road Not Taken”?

                            25. Please read this text afterwards, answer the questions that follows.
 There are six types of peer pressure and tips for parents to help their child
make healthy, life-long choices:
1.Spoken peer pressure is when a teenager asks, suggests, persuades, or
otherwise directs another to engage in a specific behavior. If the spoken
influence takes place within a group, the pressure to go along with the group
is immense. 
2. With unspoken peer pressure, a teenager is exposed to the actions of one
or more peers and is left to choose whether they want to follow along. This
could take the form of fashion choices, personal interactions or ‘joining’
types of behavior (clubs, teams, etc). Many young teens lack the mental
maturity to control impulses and make wise long-term decisions. 
3. Direct peer pressure can be spoken or unspoken. It is normally behavior
centric. Examples of these kinds of behavior would be when a teenager
hands another teen an alcoholic drink, or make a sexual advance, or looks
at another student’s paper during a test. The other student is put in a
position of having to make an on-the-spot decision. 
4. Like unspoken peer pressure, indirect peer pressure is subtle but can still
exert a strong influence on an impressionable young person. When a teen
overhears a friend gossiping about another person and then reacts to the
gossip, that is indirect peer pressure. 
5. Asking a teenager to engage in behavior that is against his/her moral
code or family values is a type of negative peer pressure. Teens see the
actions of other teens with stronger personalities and are put in a position of
following the leader or walking away. Young people often lack the skills to
say no to negative peer pressure. 
6. A group of dynamic can be a positive peer influence if the behaviors are
healthy, age appropriate and socially acceptable. For instance, if a peer
group wants to make good grades, a young teen can be positively influenced
to study. Or if a popular friend wants to earn money and save, a young
teenager may also be influenced to save and open a savings account.
