I would love the chance to change mylife with the money. The first thing I would do is buy a big, new house. I live in a smallapartment, and I have always dreamed of living in a big house in the country. With allthat money, I could buy anything I wanted. I don't have a car right now, so I would buya new car. Or, I might even buy a new motorcycle. I like motorcycles, and I can imaginemyself driving down the highway with the wind in my hair.Of course, I if I won the lottery, I should give some of the money to charity. Iwould probably give my money to a charity that helps sick children. Also, if any of myfriends needed anything, I could help them pay for it. I know many people that havestudent loans, and I could help them pay the loans back. That would make them veryhappy.

Travelling is nice, but then she had nothing left after hervacation.I think, however, that the only problem with dreaming about the money I couldwin is that I have never even played the lottery before.
