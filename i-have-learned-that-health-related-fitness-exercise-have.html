</p>Cardiovascular endurance (also known as cardiorespiratory endurance or aerobic fitness) is the body's ability to efficiently and effectively absorb oxygen and distribute it to your tissues through the heart, lungs, arteries, vessels, and veins.
You will do the following by engaging in routine exercise that challenges the heart and lungs:
Maintain or even increase the efficiency at which oxygen is delivered and absorbed by your body's structures.
Boost cellular metabolism
Reduce the physical demands of daily life
<p><strong>Muscular Endurance</strong>
</p>Muscular endurance is one of two variables that influence muscular fitness overall. Consider muscular endurance to be the ability of a certain muscle group to contract continuously against a given resistance.
Long-distance riders have a good example. Cycling requires cyclists to cultivate fatigue-resistant muscles in their legs and glutes in order to consistently ride a bike for a long distance, frequently up steep inclines. This demonstrates a high degree of physical stamina.
<p><strong>Muscular Strength</strong>
</p>Muscular endurance refers to how fatigue-resistant a specific muscle group is, while muscular strength refers to how much force a specific muscle group can produce in a single, all-out effort. It's also known as the one-rep max in weight training.
<p>
</p><p><strong>Flexibility</strong>
</p>Flexibility refers to the amount of movement you have around a certain joint. Flexibility, including muscle strength and stamina, is joint-specific. You can have very flexible shoulders but rigid and inflexible hamstrings or hips, for example.
Flexibility is essential at any age. It contributes to free movement and may have an effect on the posture, coordination, and agility. Maintaining a wide range of motion in your big joints will reduce your risk of injury and improve your athletic results.
<p><strong>Body Composition</strong>
</p>Body composition, is the final aspect of health-related physical exercise is your body's fat mass-to-fat-free mass ratio. Since high levels of fat mass are associated with negative health effects such as heart disease and type 2 diabetes, achieving and maintaining a balanced body composition is a priority of almost all daily exercise routines.<p></p><p> </p><p><strong>For more information visit this link:  </strong></p><p><strong>https://brainly.ph/question/9120830  </strong></p><p><strong>#LetsStudy</strong></p><br />
