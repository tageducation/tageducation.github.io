                                            "The Story Cinderella"1.consider the values conveyed in the portrayal of the good girl as passive weak submissive, but physically beautiful; and powerful woman as wicked and probably ugly cinderella?2.Consider the protentially misogynist theme of abused-girl-waiting-to-be-rescued-by-prince?"The Story Cinderella"THESISCinderella, far from being an innocent fairy tale about a girl achieving her dreams is actually a misogynist story that presents women as greedy and cruel or pretty and passive, and suggests that the best way for a woman to get ahead in the world is to let herself be abused and wait for help from someone else.IN THE BEGINNINGCCinderella is oppressed by her father and his new wife. She is forced to perform traditional female tasks such as cooking and cleaning. The story allows for no solidarity among women. The stepmother is presented as a monster.THE RISING ACTIONGetting a dress and looking pretty is the only way she is able to be happy, to be noticed and to gain social power. In other words, keeping her ugly kept her from power. Beauty is seen as the only way a woman can be powerful.GOING TO THE BALLAt the ball, she meets the prince, who acts very possessive while also validating her, making her feel important – all because of her looks.Cinderella: A Feminist AnalysisReader viewDANCING WITH THE PRINCEThe prince “falls in love” with her because she is the most beautiful. He only cares about her appearance. Other men ask her to dance, but he doesn’t allow them; she has gone from being her father’s property to the property of the prince. She has no say in who she dances with. He doesn’t even know her name, so how much conversation can they have had?Cinderella: A Feminist AnalysisReader viewHAPPILY EVER AFTER?The only way out of her family home is marriage to the prince. He doesn’t even recognize her at first – her most distinguishing mark is her shoe size. He drives off with two other women first. He announces that he will marry the woman who fits the shoe – he doesn’t ask. Marriage is shown to be the great goal for a woman, the height of her happiness. But what about the next fifty years?Cinderella: A Feminist AnalysisReader viewYour HomeworkCreate your own feminist critique of one of the following two fairy tales: “The Briar Rose” or “The Little Snow White.” Write a thesis statement of the kind that began this presentation: “Cinderella, far from being an innocent fairy tale about a girl achieving her dreams is actually a misogynist story that presents women as greedy and cruel or pretty and passive, and suggests that the best way for a woman to get ahead in the world is to let herself be abused and wait for help from someone else.”Defend your thesis with some argumentation and examples from the story. This is not an essay. Simply write a SEEC paragraph of 6-10 sentences. No longer. Quality is more important than quantity here.Please pakisagotnaman maayosthank​</a>

                                            "The Story Cinderella"1.consider the values conveyed in the portrayal of the good girl as passive weak submissive, but physically beautiful; and powerful woman as wicked and probably ugly cinderella?2.Consider the protentially misogynist theme of abused-girl-waiting-to-be-rescued-by-prince?"The Story Cinderella"THESISCinderella, far from being an innocent fairy tale about a girl achieving her dreams is actually a misogynist story that presents women as greedy and cruel or pretty and passive, and suggests that the best way for a woman to get ahead in the world is to let herself be abused and wait for help from someone else.IN THE BEGINNINGCCinderella is oppressed by her father and his new wife. She is forced to perform traditional female tasks such as cooking and cleaning. The story allows for no solidarity among women. The stepmother is presented as a monster.THE RISING ACTIONGetting a dress and looking pretty is the only way she is able to be happy, to be noticed and to gain social power. In other words, keeping her ugly kept her from power. Beauty is seen as the only way a woman can be powerful.GOING TO THE BALLAt the ball, she meets the prince, who acts very possessive while also validating her, making her feel important – all because of her looks.Cinderella: A Feminist AnalysisReader viewDANCING WITH THE PRINCEThe prince “falls in love” with her because she is the most beautiful. He only cares about her appearance. Other men ask her to dance, but he doesn’t allow them; she has gone from being her father’s property to the property of the prince. She has no say in who she dances with. He doesn’t even know her name, so how much conversation can they have had?Cinderella: A Feminist AnalysisReader viewHAPPILY EVER AFTER?The only way out of her family home is marriage to the prince. He doesn’t even recognize her at first – her most distinguishing mark is her shoe size. He drives off with two other women first. He announces that he will marry the woman who fits the shoe – he doesn’t ask. Marriage is shown to be the great goal for a woman, the height of her happiness. But what about the next fifty years?Cinderella: A Feminist AnalysisReader viewYour HomeworkCreate your own feminist critique of one of the following two fairy tales: “The Briar Rose” or “The Little Snow White.” Write a thesis statement of the kind that began this presentation: “Cinderella, far from being an innocent fairy tale about a girl achieving her dreams is actually a misogynist story that presents women as greedy and cruel or pretty and passive, and suggests that the best way for a woman to get ahead in the world is to let herself be abused and wait for help from someone else.”Defend your thesis with some argumentation and examples from the story. This is not an essay. Simply write a SEEC paragraph of 6-10 sentences. No longer. Quality is more important than quantity here.Please pakisagotnaman maayosthank​</a>

Minerals</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p>1. Streak, the colour of a mineral in its powdered form. It is usually obtained by rubbing the mineral on a hard, white surface, such as a tile of unglazed porcelain, so as to yield a line, or streak, of fine powder.</p><p></p><p>2. <strong>Extrusive</strong>, or <strong>volcanic</strong>, <strong>igneous rocks</strong> are formed when molten hot material cools and solidifies. Each of these rocks are formed by <strong>physical changes</strong>—such as melting, cooling, eroding, compacting, or deforming—that are part of the rock cycle. The formation of igneous rocks is a <strong>physical change</strong>, not a chemical change.</p><p></p><p>3. As minerals are broken (such as with a rock hammer, for example), some may cleave, or break, along smooth flat planes known as <strong>cleavage</strong>. These flat surfaces are parallel to directions of weakness within the crystal.</p><p></p><p>4. In 1812, a man named <strong>Fredrich Mohs</strong> invented a scale of hardness called Mohs Scale which is still used today. He selected ten standard minerals, and arranged them in order of increasing hardness. Talc is the softest and <strong>diamond</strong> is the hardest. Each mineral can scratch only those below it on the scale.</p><p></p><p>5. <strong>Tenacity</strong> refers to a mineral's resistance to breaking, bending, or otherwise being deformed. Tenacity is particularly useful in telling some of the metallic minerals apart.</p><p></p><p>6. <strong>Talc</strong> is the softest and diamond is the hardest. Each mineral can scratch only those below it on the scale.</p><p></p><p>7. The ability to transmit <strong>light</strong> is another convenient property used in the identification of minerals. Opaque minerals, such as graphite and jasper, cannot transmit light. If both light and an image can be transmitted through a mineral, such as mica, it is said to be transparent.</p><p></p><p>8. <strong>Luster</strong> describes the reflection of light off a mineral's surface.</p><p></p><p>9. <strong>Translucent</strong> to transparent minerals have a much more varied degree of color due to the presence of trace minerals.</p><p></p><p>10. <strong>Minerals</strong> are the building blocks of rocks. Nature cements combinations of minerals together to form rocks. Rocks are catagorized in three general groups according to the way they were formed.</p><p></p><p></p><p>*/I'm not sure about my answer to number 7.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>#CarryOnLearning</strong>-,-</p><br />

She is forced to perform traditional female tasks such as cooking and cleaning. The story allows for no solidarity among women. The stepmother is presented as a monster.THE RISING ACTIONGetting a dress and looking pretty is the only way she is able to be happy, to be noticed and to gain social power. In other words, keeping her ugly kept her from power. Beauty is seen as the only way a woman can be powerful.GOING TO THE BALLAt the ball, she meets the prince, who acts very possessive while also validating her, making her feel important – all because of her looks.Cinderella: A Feminist AnalysisReader viewDANCING WITH THE PRINCEThe prince “falls in love” with her because she is the most beautiful. He only cares about her appearance. Other men ask her to dance, but he doesn’t allow them; she has gone from being her father’s property to the property of the prince. She has no say in who she dances with. He doesn’t even know her name, so how much conversation can they have had?Cinderella: A Feminist AnalysisReader viewHAPPILY EVER AFTER?The only way out of her family home is marriage to the prince. He doesn’t even recognize her at first – her most distinguishing mark is her shoe size. He drives off with two other women first. He announces that he will marry the woman who fits the shoe – he doesn’t ask. Marriage is shown to be the great goal for a woman, the height of her happiness. But what about the next fifty years?Cinderella: A Feminist AnalysisReader viewYour HomeworkCreate your own feminist critique of one of the following two fairy tales: “The Briar Rose” or “The Little Snow White.” Write a thesis statement of the kind that began this presentation: “Cinderella, far from being an innocent fairy tale about a girl achieving her dreams is actually a misogynist story that presents women as greedy and cruel or pretty and passive, and suggests that the best way for a woman to get ahead in the world is to let herself be abused and wait for help from someone else.”Defend your thesis with some argumentation and examples from the story.

"The Story Cinderella"1.consider the values conveyed in the portrayal of the good girl as passive weak submissive, but physically beautiful; and powerful woman as wicked and probably ugly cinderella?2.Consider the protentially misogynist theme of abused-girl-waiting-to-be-rescued-by-prince?"The Story Cinderella"THESISCinderella, far from being an innocent fairy tale about a girl achieving her dreams is actually a misogynist story that presents women as greedy and cruel or pretty and passive, and suggests that the best way for a woman to get ahead in the world is to let herself be abused and wait for help from someone else.IN THE BEGINNINGCCinderella is oppressed by her father and his new wife. She is forced to perform traditional female tasks such as cooking and cleaning. The story allows for no solidarity among women. The stepmother is presented as a monster.THE RISING ACTIONGetting a dress and looking pretty is the only way she is able to be happy, to be noticed and to gain social power. In other words, keeping her ugly kept her from power. Beauty is seen as the only way a woman can be powerful.GOING TO THE BALLAt the ball, she meets the prince, who acts very possessive while also validating her, making her feel important – all because of her looks.Cinderella: A Feminist AnalysisReader viewDANCING WITH THE PRINCEThe prince “falls in love” with her because she is the most beautiful. He only cares about her appearance. Other men ask her to dance, but he doesn’t allow them; she has gone from being her father’s property to the property of the prince. She has no say in who she dances with. He doesn’t even know her name, so how much conversation can they have had?Cinderella: A Feminist AnalysisReader viewHAPPILY EVER AFTER?The only way out of her family home is marriage to the prince. He doesn’t even recognize her at first – her most distinguishing mark is her shoe size. He drives off with two other women first. He announces that he will marry the woman who fits the shoe – he doesn’t ask. Marriage is shown to be the great goal for a woman, the height of her happiness. But what about the next fifty years?Cinderella: A Feminist AnalysisReader viewYour HomeworkCreate your own feminist critique of one of the following two fairy tales: “The Briar Rose” or “The Little Snow White.” Write a thesis statement of the kind that began this presentation: “Cinderella, far from being an innocent fairy tale about a girl achieving her dreams is actually a misogynist story that presents women as greedy and cruel or pretty and passive, and suggests that the best way for a woman to get ahead in the world is to let herself be abused and wait for help from someone else.”Defend your thesis with some argumentation and examples from the story. This is not an essay. Simply write a SEEC paragraph of 6-10 sentences. No longer. Quality is more important than quantity here.Please pakisagotnaman maayosthank​</h2><br />
