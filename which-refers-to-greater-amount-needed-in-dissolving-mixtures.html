                        <p><strong>Solvent</strong> refers to greater amount needed in dissolving mixtures. </p><p></p><p>Here is the explanation about solute and solvent. </p><p><strong>What does "</strong><strong>solute</strong><strong>" mean?</strong></p><p>The definition of a solution is a homogeneous mixture of two or more substances. Well, a solution consists of a solute and a solvent, which are homogeneous in nature.</p><p>-<strong>Solvent:</strong> a substance that dissolves other substances.</p><p>-<strong>Solute:</strong> the substance that is dissolved in the solvent.</p><p>Generally, <strong>the amount of solvent will be more than the solute</strong>. This is so that the solute can be mixed homogeneously. The meaning of homogeneous means that it dissolves completely. For example, salt dissolved in water. As a result, the salt will melt and be homogeneous with water.</p><p></p><p><strong>Solution Characteristics</strong></p><p>The following are the properties of the solution:</p><p>A solution is a homogeneous mixture. </p><p>-If it is not homogeneous or there is a precipitate (for example, sand is put in water), it is called a suspension, not a solution.</p><p>-The particles are small and have a diameter of less than 1 nm. Therefore, it cannot be seen with the naked eye.</p><p>-Because between the solvent and the solute can not be distinguished, let's say that the component in which more is called the solvent and the less is called the solute.</p><p>-The components of a mixture cannot be separated using filtration or a sieve (because it is already homogeneous).</p><p> </p><p>  <strong>Types of Solution</strong></p><p>  Solutions have several types based on several classifications, namely:</p><p> Based on <strong>the degree of solubility:</strong></p><p>  a. Unsaturated solution.</p><p>  An unsaturated solution is a solution that can dissolve completely if added solute without going through heating. In other words, an unsaturated solution contains less solute than is required to make a saturated solution at a given temperature. For example, an unsaturated salt solution, the water can still be used to dissolve when added salt again.</p><p>  b. Saturated solution.</p><p>  A saturated solution is a solution in which the solvent can no longer dissolve the solute unless heated. In this solution, the solvent has a maximum limit to dissolve at a certain temperature. An example is a saturated salt solution, the water can still dissolve as long as it is heated.</p><p>  c.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Many people enjoy a cold glass of iced tea on a hot summer day. Some like it unsweetened, while others like to put sugar in it. How fast the sugar dissolved depends on several factors: how much sugar was put in the tea and how cold it is? You usually have to stir the tea for a while to get all the sugar dissolved.</p><p></p><p>Rate of Dissolving</p><p>We know that the dissolving of a solid by water depends upon the collisions that occur between the solvent molecules and the particles in the solid crystal. Anything that can be done to increase the frequency of those collisions and/or to give those collisions more energy will increase the rate of dissolving. Imagine that you were trying to dissolve some sugar in a glassful of tea. A packet of granulated sugar would dissolve faster than a cube of sugar. The rate of dissolving would be increased by stirring, or agitating the solution. Finally, the sugar would dissolve faster in hot tea than it would in cold tea.</p><p></p><p>Surface Area</p><p>The rate at which a solute dissolves depends upon the size of the solute particles. Dissolving is a surface phenomenon since it depends on solvent molecules colliding with the outer surface of the solute. A given quantity of solute dissolves faster when it is ground into small particles than if it is in the form of a large chunk because more surface area is exposed. The packet of granulated sugar exposes far more surface area to the solvent and dissolves more quickly than the sugar cube.</p><p></p><p>Agitation of the Solution</p><p>Dissolving sugar in water will occur more quickly if the water is stirred. The stirring allows fresh solvent molecules to continually be in contact with the solute. If it is not stirred, then the water right at the surface of the solute becomes saturated with dissolved sugar molecules, meaning that it is more difficult for additional solute to dissolve. The sugar cube would eventually dissolve because random motions of the water molecules would bring enough fresh solvent into contact with the sugar, but the process would take much longer. It is important to realize that neither stirring nor breaking up a solute affect the overall amount of solute that dissolves. It only affects the rate of dissolving.</p><p></p><p>Temperature</p><p>Heating up the solvent gives the molecules more kinetic energy. The more rapid motion means that the solvent molecules collide with the solute with greater frequency and the collisions occur with more force. Both factors increase the rate at which the solute dissolves. As we will see in the next section, a temperature change not only affects the rate of dissolving, but also affects the amount of solute that dissolves.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>i hope it helps</p><p></p><p><strong>#</strong><strong> CARRY ON </strong><strong>LEARNING</strong></p><br />
