                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p>The Transfiguration<p><strong>Characteristics:</strong> Transfiguration relates to successive stories of the Gospel of Matthew. The upper part of the painting depicts Christ elevated in front of billowing, illuminated clouds, and on either side of him are the prophets, Elijah and Moses. </p><p><strong>History: </strong>The transfiguration of Jesus is a story told in the New Testament when Jesus is transfigured and becomes radiant in glory upon a mountain. </p><p></p>David (Donatello)<p><strong>Characteristics:</strong> Extremely realistic and a prime example of Renaissance naturalism. His body appears lithe as he stands with one foot atop Goliath's decapitated head. His small frame and almost effeminate disposition imply that his victory is due to God's assistance. </p><p><strong>History:</strong> David is the title of two statues of the biblical hero David by the Italian early Renaissance sculptor Donatello. They consist of early work in marble of a clothed figure (1408–09), and a far more famous bronze figure that is nude except for helmet and boots, and dates to the 1440s or later.</p><p></p>St. Peter's Basilica<p><strong>History: </strong>St. Peter’s Basilica, also called New St. Peter’s Basilica, the present basilica of St. Peter in Vatican City (an enclave in Rome), begun by Pope Julius II in 1506 and completed in 1615 under Paul V. It is designed as a three-aisled Latin cross with a dome at the crossing, directly above the high altar, which covers the shrine of St. Peter the Apostle. </p><p></p>Self-Portrait- Rembrandt<p><strong>Characteristics:</strong> This is a defiant image, proclaiming Rembrandt's courage and awareness of his place in history. Yet it is also a melancholy painting. Rembrandt gives himself a daunting quality, belying his fall from the heights of success to a position on the margins of Dutch society.</p><p><strong>History: </strong>Self-Portrait is a 1660 oil on canvas painting by the Dutch artist Rembrandt, one of over 40 self-portraits by Rembrandt. Painted when the artist was fifty-four, it has been noted as a work in which may be seen "the wrinkled brow and the worried expression the troubled condition of his mind".</p><p> </p>David by Bernini<p><strong>Characteristics: </strong>His young figure of David symbolizes the Republic of Florence and its sense of being blessed by God, and so we see David victorious standing on the head of Goliath. ... Bernini shows us David actively fighting Goliath—with God on his side. Perhaps the way the church itself felt as they were battling against Luther.</p><p><strong>History:</strong> The sculpture was one of many commissions to decorate the villa of Bernini's patron Cardinal Scipione Borghese – where it still resides today, as part of the Galleria Borghese. It was completed in the course of seven months from 1623 to 1624.</p><p></p>The Colonnade of the Piazza<p><strong>Characteristics: </strong>At the center of the square is an ancient Egyptian obelisk, erected at the current site in 1586. Gian Lorenzo Bernini designed the square almost 100 years later, including the massive Doric colonnades, four columns deep, which embrace visitors in "the maternal arms of Mother Church". A granite fountain constructed by Bernini in 1675 matches another fountain designed by Carlo Maderno in 1613.</p><p><strong>History:</strong> In 1656, Pope Alexander VII commissioned sculptor and architect Gian Lorenzo Bernini to create a square worthy of the majesty of St. Peter's Basilica. Bernini designed an elliptical piazza that is embraced on two sides by four rows of imposing Doric columns arranged in a stunning colonnade</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Ang Kataastaasan, Kagalanggalangang Katipunan ng mga Anak ng Bayan, na kilala rin bilang Katipunan o KKK, ay isang rebolusyonaryong lipunang Pilipino na itinatag ng mga kolonyalismong Pilipino na kontra-Espanyol sa Maynila noong 1892; pangunahing layunin nito ay upang makamit ang kalayaan mula sa Espanya sa pamamagitan ng isang rebolusyon.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Ang Barasoain ay kilala dati bilang "Bangkal" na bahagi ng Encomienda ng Malolos na isinama ni Miguel Lopez de Legaspi sa bayan ng Calumpit noong Abril 5, 1572. Nang itatag ng mga prayle ng Augustinian ang Bayan ng Malolos noong 1580 bilang isang malayang bayan, naging isang Bangkal ng mga nayon ng Malolos sa ilalim ng hurisdiksyon ng simbahan ng bayan. Isang ermitanyo na gawa sa nipa at kawayan ang itinayo malapit sa ilog sa pagitan ng Maluslos (Malolos poblacion) at Barasoain para sa mga mamamayan ng Bangkal. Sa parehong taon, sina Malolos Friar Curate at Vicario Foraneo Fray Agustin Carreno, OSA ang nagtatag ng unang kapilya sa matandang Ermita ng matandang Cemetery ng Malolos. Inabandona noong 1680, nagsilbi itong pansamantalang bisita ng Barasoain, na matatagpuan sa harap ng Casa Tribunal (Presidencia), na ngayon ay tinatawag na "Casa Real de Malolos." Isang malaking sunog noong ika-17 siglo ang sumira sa bagong simbahan.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />
