During the process of a chemical reaction, the reacting elements release a certain amount of chemical energy.</p><p>The <strong>chemical energy</strong> that is released is useful for our bodies to help the organs work, maintain body temperature, and carry out daily activities.</p><p>Therefore, the <strong>existence of chemical energy</strong> is needed by humans. In addition, every form of energy that exists on earth has the law of conservation of energy.</p><p>The law of the conservation of energy is the law that states that energy cannot be created nor destroyed. Energy can change from one form to another. An example is <strong>chemical energy</strong> turning into electrical energy.</p><p>The existence of the law of the conservation of energy makes every object on earth have the power to emit energy.

For example the battery used to turn on the wall clock to keep it moving.</p><strong>Photosynthesis</strong><p>Photosynthesis is a process carried out by plants to obtain a green substance called chlorophyll. This process of photosynthesis becomes one of the solar energy that turns into chemical energy.
