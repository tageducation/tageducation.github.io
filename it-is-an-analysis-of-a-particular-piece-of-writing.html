                                            According to Huxley, an essay is a piece of writing that gives an author's own argument. It
is a "prose composition with a focused subject of discussion" or a "long, systematic discourse". Aldous
Huxley, a leading essayist, says that the essay is a literary device for saying almost everything about
almost anything. He suggests that essays can be studied most effectively within a three-poled frame of
reference. First is the personal and the autobiographical (i.e., the essayists write fragments of reflective
autobiography and look at the world through anecdotes and descriptions). Second is the objective, the
factual, and the concrete particular (i.e., the essayists do not speak directly of themselves, but turn their
attention outward to some literary or scientific or political theme. Essayists pass judgment and draw
general conclusions from the presentation relevant data. Third, is the abstract-universal (i.e., the
essayists do their work in the world of high abstractions). They are never personal and they seldom
mention the particular facts of experience. The most satisfying essays make the best not of one, not of
two, but of all the three worlds in which it is possible for the essay to exist.
Apply Huxley’s analysis to the essays of Rizal, as a whole, and briefly write about your insights in an
essay.</a>

                            16. According to Huxley, an essay is a piece of writing that gives an author's own argument. It
is a "prose composition with a focused subject of discussion" or a "long, systematic discourse". Aldous
Huxley, a leading essayist, says that the essay is a literary device for saying almost everything about
almost anything. He suggests that essays can be studied most effectively within a three-poled frame of
reference. First is the personal and the autobiographical (i.e., the essayists write fragments of reflective
autobiography and look at the world through anecdotes and descriptions). Second is the objective, the
factual, and the concrete particular (i.e., the essayists do not speak directly of themselves, but turn their
attention outward to some literary or scientific or political theme. Essayists pass judgment and draw
general conclusions from the presentation relevant data. Third, is the abstract-universal (i.e., the
essayists do their work in the world of high abstractions). They are never personal and they seldom
mention the particular facts of experience. The most satisfying essays make the best not of one, not of
two, but of all the three worlds in which it is possible for the essay to exist.
Apply Huxley’s analysis to the essays of Rizal, as a whole, and briefly write about your insights in an
essay.</h2><br />
