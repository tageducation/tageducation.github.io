Depending on your school and institution, there are certain rulings and they come with their own severity that would bring us to being stopped from coming to school. Usually, only a terrible mistake would result in a <strong>detention</strong>, for example involved into a fight between students.</p><p></p><p>I also never observed one of my friends who got punished with <strong>detention</strong>.

                        <p><strong>UNFORGETTABLE EXPERIENCE AT THE AIRPORT DETENTION:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>At that time, Turkey experienced the coup. My first trip abroad, I didn't expect to be caught in a coup.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>EXPLANATION:</strong></p><p>It was probably the most memorable day for me. I got to experience the gripping times of the Turkish military coup at Ataturk Airport. How's the story?</p><p></p><p>The story of my <strong>being trapped at Ataturk Airport</strong> began when I was about to travel home after a month in Manila. I used this vacation to visit my mother, who was at that time living in Istanbul. That was my first overseas trip. There was no premonition whatsoever if he would be caught in a coup d'etat.</p><p></p><p>At 8.00 pm Manila time, I took off from the airport using Turkish Airlines to transit at Ataturk. However, upon arrival at the airport, there were a number of oddities. When it was around 24.00, there were no more officers at the airport. There are no airport gate attendants. Inside the airport, there was a very dense accumulation of passengers. On the information screen, it appeared that flights to all destinations had been delayed indefinitely.</p><p></p><p>I told the story that night, the situation was quite tense. Especially when I saw a group of people jostling from the top floor of the airport to the lower floor for no apparent reason. Not only that, there were even passengers who tried to hide in the toilet. I don't understand what happened. "If you want to find information, you can't because you don't know the airport wifi password."</p><p></p><p>For several hours inside the airport, I didn't know what to do. Fear filled the air when there was an explosion from the sky. There was also the sound of warplanes passing over the airport. <strong>There were about five explosions in the airport sky. Suddenly we hid near the detention room.</strong></p><p></p><p>My feelings that were raging with fear and confusion to see the situation at the airport began to subside after I got acquainted with a Malaysian citizen. Incidentally, this Malaysian citizen will have also returned to his home country. With this new friend, I was helped a lot. Starting to tell the information that was going on to inform the mother.</p><p></p><p>From this friend's gadget, I just found out that there was a coup. Inside the airport, the situation without officers is used by passengers to loot food. I admit that I also tasted the loot that was distributed to the passengers. At around 04.00 in the morning, a group of people from outside the airport came inside. Inside the airport they speak Turkish shouting chants of the incumbent President. After 06.00, it was declared that the airport situation was safe and it was announced that flights would return to normal. I was only able to continue the journey around 12 noon.</p><p></p><p>Learn how to distinguish unlawful arrest from illegal detention here:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/22825552</p><p></p><p>#SPJ2</p><br />

                            4. Have you ever gotten in trouble because someone caught you cheating (or thought you were cheating)? What happened? What do you wish had happened?</h2><br />
                        <p>If indeed I <strong>cheated</strong> and got caught by other people, then there's not much I can do. Maybe my test paper is taken and then I'm told to leave the class and can't take the exam.</p><p>But if in reality I'm not cheating and someone thinks I'm cheating, I will deny that and stick to the honesty that I'm not cheating. I hope that in such a situation, there are witnesses or evidence such as CCTV who can defend and show that I am not cheating.</p><p></p>The bad effects of cheating<p>1. <strong>Lack of self-assurance</strong></p><p>Basically, cheating behavior aims to make it easier for you to solve problems question by question. Consciously or not, this behavior confirms that you do not have the confidence to fill out the answers, so that you inevitably have to act fraudulently.</p><p>In addition to violating school rules, cheating can bring about such a bad habit for you. Losing confidence is not an easy matter; returning it is not as easy as we imagine.</p><p>2. <strong>You will struggle to solve your own problems.</strong></p><p>Why should there be cheating behavior. Well, because you can't finish what you're doing, look for answers from friends or from books that have been previously provided.</p><p>If you can't solve problem after problem, how can you solve life's complicated problems? The habit of cheating can carry over into adulthood, but you know, you can't do it continuously.</p><p>3.<strong>Make us lazy</strong></p><p>When you cheat and succeed in doing it many times, the sure thing that will happen to you is that you are too lazy to study, especially in the context of memorizing, because you don't have to think about doing the questions.</p><p>So, don't make cheating your habit at the time of the exam. The bad impact can happen to yourself at the time of the exam, which will damage your future later.</p><p>4. <strong>You lie to your own values, including your parents</strong></p><p>When you get good grades from cheating, isn't that the same as lying about the grades you get as well as your parents. So, don't let you lie to yourself, your grades, your teachers, and your parents, who have been struggling to pay school fees all this time.</p><p> </p><p>Learn information about the bad effects of cheating https://brainly.ph/question/7523974.</p><p>#SPJ5</p><br />

                        Answer<p>The traits you get from your parents depends on the genes they pass on to you. For women, they inherit 50% of their DNA from each parent. Men inherit about 51% from the mother and only 49% from the father.</p>Explanation<p>Genes come in pairs. Each parent has two copies of their genes but only one copy of it is passed along to the child. The genes inherited by the child determines the physical traits such as hair color, skin color, eye color, etc.</p><p>For example, the mother has one brown hair and one black hair gene. She passed to the child a black hair gene. So, if the father has two black hair genes, then the child would have black hair. The child then would have two black hair genes.</p>So, figure out which physical trait of your face is similar to your parent. Think about questions like these: <p>Are your eyes the same as your mom, or dad? do you have the same nose as your dad? or does your lip resembles your mother?</p><p></p><p><strong>Characteristic of a Graphic Fiction - </strong>brainly.ph/question/9376884</p><p>#BrainlyFast</p><br />

                            15. what are the behavioral attributes you have gotten from your mother's side how about your father side​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>Academic success</strong></p><p>When a mom scolds her child for getting a D at school, and she points out that she did much better in her studies, in one sense she really has a point. Academic success is 55% dependent on your genetic inheritance. Thousands of genes are directly responsible for how well you perform in school. So if your parents demonstrated outstanding abilities during their school days, you've got great potential.</p><p><strong>Color blindness from your mother</strong></p><p>The inability to differentiate between certain colors is often something that a person inherits through their genes. The gene which produces it is often inherited by sons from their mothers. For the most part, it's men who suffer from color blindness. This is due to the fact that within their genetic makeup, the defect of the single maternal X chromosome is not compensated for, whereas women have an "emergency" X chromosome from their fathers.</p><p><strong>Lactose intolerance</strong></p><p>It might sound surprising, but 65% of adults have a lowered ability to digest lactose, or milk sugar. One particular gene is responsible for this. When a child is still very young and he needs milk to survive, the body creates an enzyme for digesting lactose. As that person gets older, however, their ability to absorb dairy products falls. Only a fraction of people have the gene for lactose tolerance, meaning that they can digest milk effectively without any problems at any age.</p><p><strong>Shortsightedness</strong></p><p>The likelihood that a person has or will develop shortsightedness is inherited. If both parents have this problem, then the risk of the child developing it is around 50%.
</p><p>
</p><p>However, scientists believe that we can't ascribe absolutely everything here to genetics. Those who spend less time sitting in front of a computer and avoid straining their eyes are far less likely to suffer from shortsightedness.</p><p><strong>Popularity</strong></p><p>It might sound unbelievable, but the secret of a person's popularity is hidden in their genes. Harvard scientists reached this conclusion after long years of painstaking research. They believe that at the dawn of humankind's existence, those who possessed valuable information about food sources or danger were at the center of a given social group's attention. These people passed on their genes to their descendants. The people who inherited these genes are those who are popular among their peers and who people often want to be friends with. How did this come to pass? Perhaps future research will make this clearer.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Hope it helps! </p><br />

                        <p>10 Personal Attributes You Never Knew You Inherited From Your Parents</p><p></p><p>1. High cholesterol levels - Many people believe high levels of cholesterol are connected with what you eat. If you want to live a long and happy life, you need to eat vegetables and fruit and get plenty of exercise - or so goes the common belief.</p><p></p><p>But sometimes high cholesterol levels actually depend not on our lifestyle but on our genes. About 1 in every 500 people has a special genetic mutation which leads to an accumulation of cholesterol in their blood. These people will have high levels of this substance even if they eat nothing but vegetables.</p><p></p><p>2. Male pattern baldness comes from the mother</p><p> - One of the genes that plays a role in baldness is located in the X chromosome. Men inherit it from their mothers. But don't rush to blame her for your thinning hairline - there are other genes that play a role here, including ones inherited from the father. Moreover, environmental factors also have an effect on hair loss.</p><p></p><p>3. Academic success - When a mom scolds her child for getting a D at school, and she points out that she did much better in her studies, in one sense she really has a point. Academic success is 55% dependent on your genetic inheritance. Thousands of genes are directly responsible for how well you perform in school. So if your parents demonstrated outstanding abilities during their school days, you've got great potential.</p><p></p><p>4. Love of coffee - Do you drink a lot of coffee? Well, your genes are entirely to blame! Scientists conducted a comparative study of people who can't live without coffee and those who can. It turned out that the second group had a particular set of genes which meant they absorbed caffeine more slowly. This meant that they didn't feel a particular need to drink it on a regular basis in order to get a rush of energy.</p><p></p><p>5. Maturity-onset diabetes of the young - Type 2 diabetes usually develops among older people. But sometimes it occurs in children and adolescents with an active lifestyle. This is known as maturity-onset diabetes of the young, and it appears as a result of a genetic mutation, although a poor diet can also play a role.</p><p></p><p>6. Color blindness from your mother - The inability to differentiate between certain colors is often something that a person inherits through their genes. The gene which produces it is often inherited by sons from their mothers. For the most part, it's men who suffer from color blindness. This is due to the fact that within their genetic makeup, the defect of the single maternal X chromosome is not compensated for, whereas women have an "emergency" X chromosome from their fathers.</p><p></p><p>7. Lactose intolerance - It might sound surprising, but 65% of adults have a lowered ability to digest lactose, or milk sugar. One particular gene is responsible for this. When a child is still very young and he needs milk to survive, the body creates an enzyme for digesting lactose. As that person gets older, however, their ability to absorb dairy products falls. Only a fraction of people have the gene for lactose tolerance, meaning that they can digest milk effectively without any problems at any age.</p><p></p><p>8. The ability to drive a car - What many of us have long suspected has been confirmed by scientists: not everyone has the innate ability to drive a car. You can learn all the rules of the road and pass your driving test, but if you have special genes that affect your ability to orientate yourself, the speed of your reactions, or your memory, then getting behind the wheel may still turn out to be a bad idea. You're more likely to get distracted while driving and are therefore at greater risk of being in an accident. Scientists believe these genes are in as much as 30% of the population.</p><p></p><p>9. Shortsightedness - The likelihood that a person has or will develop shortsightedness is inherited. If both parents have this problem, then the risk of the child developing it is around 50%.</p><p></p><p>However, scientists believe that we can't ascribe absolutely everything here to genetics. Those who spend less time sitting in front of a computer and avoid straining their eyes are far less likely to suffer from shortsightedness.</p><p></p><p>10. Popularity - It might sound unbelievable, but the secret of a person's popularity is hidden in their genes. Harvard scientists reached this conclusion after long years of painstaking research. They believe that at the dawn of humankind's existence, those who possessed valuable information about food sources or danger were at the center of a given social group's attention. These people passed on their genes to their descendants. The people who inherited these genes are those who are popular among their peers and who people often want to be friends with.
