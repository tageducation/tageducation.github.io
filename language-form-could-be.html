                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1) The Communication Process</p><p>The sender must encode the message (the information being conveyed) into a form that is appropriate to the communication channel, and the receiver(s) then decodes the message to understand its meaning and significance. Misunderstanding can occur at any stage of the communication process.</p><p></p><p>2) At its simplest, communication consists of a speaker, a message, and a receiver. Following this model, your speech represents the message. Naturally, this makes you the speaker. To whom you speak then, represents the receiver: in this case, your audience.</p><p></p><p>3) FORMAL/INFORMAL</p><p></p><p>4) Communication serves five major purposes: to inform, to express feelings, to imagine, to influence, and to meet social expectations.
