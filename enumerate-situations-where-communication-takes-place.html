                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>What is a communication transaction?</strong></p><p>The transactional model of communication refers to a continuous information exchange in which both the sender and the receiver are engaged and take turns communicating messages. Participants are referred to as communicators, and they might be either humans or machines. This engagement model defines communication as a Circular model of communication since the communication process of sending the message occurs at the same time. The transaction model, unlike other communication standards, is a two-way process rather than a one-way linear model.</p><p></p><p><strong>Situations where communication transaction takes place</strong></p><strong>Face-to-face interaction with family members</strong><p>Nowadays that most people are stuck at home doing their work and online classes, we are most likely to communicate with our family members face-to-face. Face-to-face interaction within the family is effective because you can communicate in a way where you can also see and hear the reaction of the people you are talking to. </p><p>Verbal and non-verbal communications make face-to-face interaction more intimate and personal. It is an effective way of communication if you want to get a clear response from other people</p><strong>Zoom Call</strong><p>Almost everyone is using many software and applications to communicate with other people virtually. One of the most commonly used applications is Zoom. Here, you can convey the things that you want to say and announce to people/s. Zoom Call meetings are sometimes used in classes as well. It is a very effective tool used in delivering a lesson. Although this is very useful, you cannot see all the reactions of your listeners or the people that you are interacting with. You cannot also hear from them if they are on mute. It is not as effective as face-to-face communication in terms of getting clear reactions from other people. But it has an advantage in delivering a message without comprising health and social distancing that we are facing now. </p><p></p><strong>Class Group Ch at</strong><p>Group ch at enables a collaborative and participative approach to information exchange, which can increase information quality. Immediate dissemination of critical information: If you work in a fast-changing sector, you may need to convey essential information in real-time.</p><p>You can get updates from your classmates about announcements, assessments, and lessons. It is a useful tool that makes use of a non-voice form of communication. </p><p></p><p>To know more about communication transactions, click here</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/3196101</p><p></p><p>Hope this helps! :)</p><p></p><p><strong>#BRAINLYFAST</strong></p><p></p><br />
