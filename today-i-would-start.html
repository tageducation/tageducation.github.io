How will I take care of the kids? What about money?I’m afraid of him, but I’m too scared and dependent to leave him!But I know he must be sorry;Because he sent me flowers today.I got flowers today….Today was a special day.—it was the day of my funeral;Last night he killed me;If only I would have gathered the courage and strength to leave him.Mahahalagang tanong:1.

                                            Activity 1: Connector Your job is to connect the contents of the reading selection to current or past real-world events and experiences. You will also connect the reading to other forms of literature, music, art and/or media. The year 2020 was one of my most awaited years because I had a lot of plans for this year and this decade, My friends and I had planned to visit several cities before the year ended. I had also planned to visit several relatives and to work more this year with the kids from church. However, this has turned out to be a historical year because of the COVID-19 pandemic. When the virus started in China, no one would have imagined that it would cross borders and would hit the world like it has today. Worse of all , I would never have imagined that I would see the most deaths from a virus in such a short time. Though everything seems tough at this moment, I have also witnessed some positives, and one of them is that the pandemic has forced me to spend time with my family and appreciate life and other basics such as food and shelter, which I always took for granted. My resilience level has also gone high because I have become tough from the situations around me. For example, I can now cope with being indoors the whole day. I also find myself being even more creative with my family. MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WITH THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC Posted On: May 22, 2020 Real World Connections: Relate current reading to real situations. Experiences: Relate current reading to real experiences you or others have had. Literature and Media Connections: Relate current reading to other books, movies art, television, music and other media​</a>

You will also connect the reading to other forms of literature, music, art and/or media. The year 2020 was one of my most awaited years because I had a lot of plans for this year and this decade, My friends and I had planned to visit several cities before the year ended. I had also planned to visit several relatives and to work more this year with the kids from church. However, this has turned out to be a historical year because of the COVID-19 pandemic. When the virus started in China, no one would have imagined that it would cross borders and would hit the world like it has today. Worse of all , I would never have imagined that I would see the most deaths from a virus in such a short time. Though everything seems tough at this moment, I have also witnessed some positives, and one of them is that the pandemic has forced me to spend time with my family and appreciate life and other basics such as food and shelter, which I always took for granted. My resilience level has also gone high because I have become tough from the situations around me. For example, I can now cope with being indoors the whole day. I also find myself being even more creative with my family.
