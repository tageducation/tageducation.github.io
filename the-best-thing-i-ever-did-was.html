(2 points each) THESE EXTRAORDINARY TRUE STORIES WILL REMIND YOU ABOUT THE POWER OF TRUST By Charlotte Hilton Andersen Taking a leap of faith and trusting someone else is one of the scariest things you can do, but these people's stories prove that it's worth it. I trusted a career coach - and now I have the job of my dreams "My first job out of college laid me off after just a few years. It was part of a brutal merger and lots of my co-workers also lost their jobs. Part of our severance package was a career counselling service but I didn't want anything to do with it. I was frustrated, depressed, and blamed myself for not being good enough. I was convinced I was a terrible worker and no company would ever want to hire me again. About a month after the layoff, I was wallowing in my misery when a career coach from the counselling company called. He told me to just come in and talk to him. When I said I thought it was a waste of time, he told me to trust him and just try it. Plus, it was already paid for so what did I have to lose? "I went in and met with him. Not only did he totally revamp my resume but he gave me a ton of good advice. He helped me see how unhappy I'd been in my previous position and that I really wanted to focus on a different area in my field. I ended up going to graduate school on his advice to get an advanced degree in a more specialized area. My new resume also got me a lot of interviews and within a couple of months I was in a graduate program for professionals and working at an amazing job. It's been nearly 10 years and now I say that getting laid off was the best thing that ever happened to me - that and trusting that career coach." - Jason Anderson Source: https//drsia com/rute is diskinin her en cuentes-wiitemind you-cho-theres​</a>

                                            1. Junk food should be banned in all school canteens all over the country. These
junk food have low nutritional value, thus these must not be sold in all schools.
Children should not consume such food to develop a healthy lifestyle.
2. UNICEF, or the United Nations Children’s Fund provides the following tips to
reduce the risk of infection of Corona Virus Disease 2019. First, wash hands
often by using soap and water or an alcohol-based hand rub. Next, cover your
mouth and nose if you cough or sneeze with the inside of your elbow. Then, do
not get close to anyone who has cold or flu-like symptoms. Then, go to the
doctor if you have a fever, cough or feel that it is difficult to breathe. Finally, if
you go to the market, do not touch animals or anything in the area they stay.
3. The quarantine makes me appreciate many things in life. Before, I did not mind
the little things around me. Now, I learn to appreciate everything. Every day I
am grateful for the gifts of life, family and nature that God has given me. I am
blessed to have a healthy body. I am happy that I have parents who are always
ready in looking for ways to provide our basic needs especially the food that we
eat daily. Likewise, I am pleased to have siblings who are actively doing their
respective household chores. Moreover, I appreciate the wonderful trees and
flowers that surround our house. All these things should not be taken for
granted.
4. My beloved dog is the sweetest pet that I ever have. His name is Lucky. He is
as small as a rabbit. He has soft and shiny brown fur. He also has black eyes
that sparkle like diamonds. He has a short tail that always wags. He is a
cheerful dog. Playing with him makes me happy. I consider him as my sweetest
best friend.

About a month after the layoff, I was wallowing in my misery when a career coach from the counselling company called. He told me to just come in and talk to him.

3. The quarantine makes me appreciate many things in life. Before, I did not mind
the little things around me. Now, I learn to appreciate everything. Every day I
am grateful for the gifts of life, family and nature that God has given me. I am
blessed to have a healthy body. I am happy that I have parents who are always
ready in looking for ways to provide our basic needs especially the food that we
eat daily. Likewise, I am pleased to have siblings who are actively doing their
respective household chores. Moreover, I appreciate the wonderful trees and
flowers that surround our house. All these things should not be taken for
granted.

cheerful dog. Playing with him makes me happy. I consider him as my sweetest
best friend.
