                        1. Free Education to All. 
Some of the public schools ad universities n the Philippines are already complying to this bill but, not all of the school have 100% free education and have hidden charges. Although it is much cheaper than the private schools and universities but still, many of Filipinos doesn't afford it. So, in order to supply free education for all, we have to put additional allowance for each student.
<p>
</p>2. Free Shelter to Homeless People.
Shelter is one of the basic needs of a person, it should be comfortable and make you feel protected. Unfortunately, many of the Filipinos still struggling about their shelters. In my opinion, this matter cannot be resolve by our government alone but, it should be a joint effort of the people and the government. Every family should exert their efforts in order to afford their own house also, the government should help families that needs extra help on this matter.
<p>
</p>3. Free Medication for All.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Free Education to All.</p><p>Importance: Some of the public schools ad universities n the Philippines are already complying to this bill but, not all of the school have 100% free education and have hidden charges. Although it is much cheaper than the private schools and universities but still, many of Filipinos doesn't afford it. So, in order to supply free education for all, we have to put additional allowance for each student.</p><p>2. Free Shelter to Homeless People.</p><p>Importance: Shelter is one of the basic needs of a person, it should be comfortable and make you feel protected. Unfortunately, many of the Filipinos still struggling about their shelters. In my opinion, this matter cannot be resolve by our government alone but, it should be a joint effort of the people and the government. Every family should exert their efforts in order to afford their own house also, the government should help families that needs extra help on this matter.</p><p>3.

                        <p>Arguments over the filibuster tend to devolve into relatively esoteric debates about minority rights and majority rule. But let's ground this conversation in real-world consequences: In the absence of the filibuster, what laws would have passed the Senate that didn't?</p><p></p><p>Follow the latest on Election 2020</p><p>In order to limit the size of the search, we begin the clock with the 111th Congress, which began in January 2009. We're looking for bills that got more than 50 votes in the Senate but that didn't make it to the president's desk. In most cases, bills that failed due to a filibuster in the 111th Congress had already passed the House, so they would be law today. In the 112th Congress, the Republican House was less aligned with the Democratic Senate, and so passage in the Senate does not mean the bills would gave been passed into law.</p><p></p><p>A disclaimer: If there was no filibuster, the two parties' strategies would be different. The bills they pushed would almost certainly be different. No examination of roll-call votes will reveal the bills that would've been passed in a world without the filibuster, but which the majority party didn't bother pursuing because they recognized they would be filibustered.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>next answer is measures or bills and explaining the needs of passing them.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />
