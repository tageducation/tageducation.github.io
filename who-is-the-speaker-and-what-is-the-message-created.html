                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>4. Poetic devices: Tools of the poet Identify different poetic devices and how they convey the poem's message. • Simile - comparison using like or as.• Metaphor - a direct comparison --- between two things that does not use like or as: Her smile is sunshine. The word metaphor is more broad and can also refer to a variety of ways of comparing or connecting different things, including those that don't use words at all.•Personification - giving human qualities to nonhuman things---- be they animals, inanimate objects, or even intangible concepts. "The moon glared in the window at me." This is personification. •Tone - what emotion does the speaker use as he talks---tone and mood are two different things. The tone is the attitude of the narrator/speaker, and the mood is the emotion or feeling that a piece gives to readers. The speaker is describing his feelings, and the reader is along for the ride.•Point of view - who is the telling the poem-----point of view is what the speaker, narrator, or character can see from their perspective. This can change dramatically depending on who the character is, their own background, the poet's intentions, and the character's reliability. It is also possible that the “speaker” is the poet his/herself.•Imagery - creating pictures with words  is the act of using language to create images in the reader's mind. Writers use descriptive words and phrases to help the reader feel like they're...well, wherever the writer wants them to be! Basically, the writer is trying to create a “mental image” for the reader through the words they choose.•Alliteration - repeating the same letter is a literary device that involves two or more words that appear close together and have the same initial stressed consonant syllable. “Good grief” and “red rose” are two examples. This repeat of sound usually involves the same letters in both words.<p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>GRADE 7 BE LIKE HOPE IT HELPS&lt;3<br />
