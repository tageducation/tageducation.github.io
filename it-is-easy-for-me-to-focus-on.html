(Dear Mama)Sweet lady, place no one above you (You are appreciated)Sweet lady, don't you know we love you?Now, ain't nobody tell us it was fairNo love from my daddy, 'cause the coward wasn't thereHe passed away and I didn't cry, 'cause my angerWouldn't let me feel for a strangerThey say I'm wrong and I'm heartless, but all alongI was lookin' for a father, he was goneI hung around with the thugsAnd even though they sold drugsThey showed a young brother loveI moved out and started really hangin'I needed money of my own, so I started slangin'I ain't guilty, 'cause even though I sell rocksIt feels good puttin' money in your mailboxI love payin' rent when the rent's dueI hope you got the diamond necklace that I sent to you'Cause when I was low you was there for meAnd never left me alone, because you cared for meAnd I could see you comin' home after work lateYou're in the kitchen, tryin' to fix us a hot plateYou just workin' with the scraps you was givenAnd Mama made miracles every Thanksgivin'But now the road got rough, you're aloneYou're tryin' to raise two bad kids on your ownAnd there's no way I can pay you backBut my plan is to show you that I understandYou are appreciatedLady, don't you know we love you? (And dear Mama)Sweet lady, place no one above you (You are appreciated)Sweet lady, don't you know we love you?Pour out some liquor and I reminisce'Cause through the drama I can always depend on my mamaAnd when it seems that I'm hopelessYou say the words that can get me back in focusWhen I was sick as a little kidTo keep me happy there's no limit to the things you didAnd all my childhood memoriesAre full of all the sweet things you did for meAnd even though I act crazyI gotta thank the Lord that you made meThere are no words that can express how I feelYou never kept a secret, always stayed realAnd I appreciate how you raised meAnd all the extra love that you gave meI wish I could take the pain awayIf you can make it through the night, there's a brighter dayEverything will be alright if you hold onIt's a struggle every day, gotta roll onAnd there's no way I can pay you backBut my plan is to show you that I understandYou are appreciatedLady, don't you know we love you?
