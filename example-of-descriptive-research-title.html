                        <p>I have accepted the fact that people who suffer from anxiety and depression will never be cured. Therapy is always there but I've never really seen it as an option probably because I live in the Philippines. However, I meet more and more people who have chosen to get help and so far, there are mixed opinions. The Philippines already has the Mental Health Act approved by the two houses of the senate which hopefully will be passed into law this year (2018).
