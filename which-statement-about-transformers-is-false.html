Quantitative, a research which involves using the method which appears best suited to the research problem and not getting caught up in philosophical debates about which is the best approach. 2. Researchers are interested in gaining a rich and complex understanding of people's experience and not in obtaining information which can be generalized to other larger groups. 3. Depending on which measures have been used, the data collected is analyzed in the appropriate manner. However, it is sometimes possible to transform qualitative data into quantitative data and vice versa although transforming quantitative data into qualitative data is not very common. 4. Qualitative research often involves a bigger number of participants. 5. The pragmatic approach to science involves using the method which appears best suited to the research problem and not getting caught up in philosophical debates about which is the best approach. 6. The approach to data collection and analysis is methodical but allows for greater flexibility than in quantitative research. 7. Data is collected in textual form on the basis of observation and interaction with the participants. 8. Advocacy/participatory approach feels that the approaches to research described so far do not respond to the needs or situation of people from marginalized or vulnerable groups. 9. As they aim to bring about positive change in the lives of the research subjects, their approach is sometimes described as emancipatory. 10. It is not a neutral stance.​</a>

Emile Durkheim set up the first European department of sociology and became France’s first sociology professor in 1895.____________ 8.

Question text
Read the following example of a definition paragraph: 
Soren Kierkegaard, another famous existentialist, comprehends absurd as a synonym to paradox. He defines it as a matter of faith and the only phenomena that allows a person to believe in self. According to his philosophy, a human being is a synthesis of opposites: eternal and temporary, finite and infinite, freedom and obligation. Due to the synthesis of these opposites in an individual’s consciousness, one constantly resides in fear and despair (Liam 194). And the more self-consciousness one possesses, the deeper these feelings are. The only way for salvation is faith in God and this is where absurd comes in. Kierkegaard refers to the biblical myth about Abraham and his son Isaac. According to this legend, God required Abraham to sacrifice his son to Him. In this case, Abraham’s faith led him to commit a crime; it transformed a murder into an act of charity and simultaneously, where faith had returned Isaac to his father alive. Faith cannot be logically argued, but it works and this is absurd. Individuals are free and this freedom lets them find their own way to God.

Read the following example of a definition paragraph: 
The term protein quality refers to the ratio of essential amino acids (eaa) in a protein in comparison with the ratio required by the body. A high quality protein contains eaa in a ratio that matches human requirements. A protein which is lacking or low in one or more eaa is termed a low quality protein. The eaa which is in the shortest supply is called the ‘limiting’ amino acid. In general, animal proteins tend to be high quality while vegetable proteins tend to be low quality. The exception is soy protein which is quite high quality.

A transformer can function with either an  alternating current (AC) or steady direct current (DC).</strong></p><p></p><p>The transformer should be an electrical component rather an electronic component. It is built so energy from one circuit can transfer to another circuit by means of magnetic coupling. It is a simple static electro-magnetic passive electrical device working on the principle of Faraday's law of induction. Alternating current (AC) creates magnetic flux in the core on the first winding, while inducing the voltage in the others. It can convert high and low voltages. However it cannot convert AC to DC. <strong>In Direct current or DC supply, there is no inductance, only resistance will act in the circuit.</strong></p><p></p><p>AC and DC in electricity:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/532625</p><p></p><p>Difference between direct current and alternating current:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/793690</p><p></p><p>Advantage of alternating current:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/2055363</p><p></p><p><strong>Code: 10.22.2.1</strong></p><br />

Question text
Read the following example of a definition paragraph: 
Soren Kierkegaard, another famous existentialist, comprehends absurd as a synonym to paradox. He defines it as a matter of faith and the only phenomena that allows a person to believe in self. According to his philosophy, a human being is a synthesis of opposites: eternal and temporary, finite and infinite, freedom and obligation. Due to the synthesis of these opposites in an individual’s consciousness, one constantly resides in fear and despair (Liam 194). And the more self-consciousness one possesses, the deeper these feelings are. The only way for salvation is faith in God and this is where absurd comes in. Kierkegaard refers to the biblical myth about Abraham and his son Isaac. According to this legend, God required Abraham to sacrifice his son to Him. In this case, Abraham’s faith led him to commit a crime; it transformed a murder into an act of charity and simultaneously, where faith had returned Isaac to his father alive. Faith cannot be logically argued, but it works and this is absurd. Individuals are free and this freedom lets them find their own way to God.

Read the following example of a definition paragraph: 
The term protein quality refers to the ratio of essential amino acids (eaa) in a protein in comparison with the ratio required by the body. A high quality protein contains eaa in a ratio that matches human requirements. A protein which is lacking or low in one or more eaa is termed a low quality protein. The eaa which is in the shortest supply is called the ‘limiting’ amino acid. In general, animal proteins tend to be high quality while vegetable proteins tend to be low quality. The exception is soy protein which is quite high quality.
