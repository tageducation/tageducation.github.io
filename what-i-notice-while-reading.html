As I walked in the door, I was amazed at the beautiful colors and smells. I knew it would be hard to decide what I would buy with my P500.

The lifeguard watched closely to keep children from running. ________________________________________________________________________________________________________3. I was allowed to push the cart. The front left wheel was broken, so the cart wobbled down each aisle. Mother put various packages and boxes in the cart, but I didn’t notice. I was trying to keep the cart going straight as it got heavier and heavier. _________________________________________________________________________________________________________4. As we entered, a large blast of water hit the windshield. Huge flopping sponges began to slap at the hood as we slowly moved forward. Soon there were suds spilling over the sides.

Casey and I decided to use the monkey bars until our teacher called us._________________________________________________________________________________________________________</a>

"Master!" said the camel. It is very cold outside. May I put my head inside your tent? You have a warm fire in there."
The man answered, "You have a coat of fur to keep you warm. Oh well, put your head inside."
A little later, the camel said, "Master, the rest of me is cold. May I bring my front legs inside?" The man wanted to sleep, so he agreed. He moved over so there was room for the camel's front legs. The camel was happy but not for long.
"Master, my back legs are cold. Please move into the comer so that I can get them in." The man moved and the camel came in. Now, there was no room in the tent at all
"Master, there isn't any room in the tent. I cannot turn," said the greedy camel. There isn't enough room for both of us. I am bigger that you are. I think you should go outside."
The man sat up and looked at his camel. "I knew this would happen. Why did I let you in?" he said as the camel pushed him into the cold

"Master!" said the camel. It is very cold outside. May I put my head inside your tent? You have a warm fire in there."
The man answered, "You have a coat of fur to keep you warm. Oh well, put your head inside."
A little later, the camel said, "Master, the rest of me is cold. May I bring my front legs inside?" The man wanted to sleep, so he agreed. He moved over so there was room for the camel's front legs. The camel was happy but not for long.
"Master, my back legs are cold. Please move into the comer so that I can get them in." The man moved and the camel came in. Now, there was no room in the tent at all
"Master, there isn't any room in the tent. I cannot turn," said the greedy camel. There isn't enough room for both of us. I am bigger that you are. I think you should go outside."
The man sat up and looked at his camel. "I knew this would happen. Why did I let you in?" he said as the camel pushed him into the cold

                        MY NOTICE ABOUT THE GIFT OF THE MAGI<p></p><p>The short story "<strong>The Gift of the Magi</strong>" by O., The story of Henry centers on a couple's effort to find important holiday gifts for one another. Due to their limited funds, the couple sacrifices a prized possession to buy a gift for one another.</p><p>The message of <strong>"The Gift of the Magi"</strong> is that love is more important than physical attractiveness. In this short novella, each character surrenders his or her most prized possession. <strong>Jim</strong> gives up his watch, which elevates his status in the eyes of others; <strong>Della</strong> gives up her hair, which causes other women to covet her.</p><p>They are compared to <strong>the Magi </strong>because <strong>the Magi </strong>were the wise men who gave gifts to the infant Jesus. They are compared to these wise men not because their actions were wise but because they had offered the most precious gift of all: love.</p><p>In the story's climax, it is revealed that Jim has sold his pocket watch to purchase hair combs for <strong>Della</strong>, while<strong> Della </strong>has sold her long hair to purchase a watch chain for <strong>Jim</strong>, so illustrating the situational irony. It is paradoxical that each individual's sacrifice has rendered the sacrifice of the other meaningless. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Learn more about The Gift of the Magi</strong></p><p><strong>https://brainly.ph/question/7323200</strong></p><p><strong>#SPJ2</strong></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>What I notice while reading - - - there seems to be a lot more detail from the story that might give readers a slight feeling of disinterest especially in the first few paragraphs where the name James Dillingham Young was given a lot more emphasis than needed. The story has these dispondent characters from the very start that almost give off a little bit of an eerie feel considering it is a Christmas story. Bottomline though, the plot of the story saves the loneliness of the most parts and the lesson it gave to the readers about giving and receiving to and from your loved ones is spectacular.</p><p>What I wonder about while reading - - - - while reading, I wondered if the plot will save the dejected feel throughout the story and thankfully it did. The author gave the characters life and clearly depicts a pair of lovers in despair but with a love so strong. Its almost uncanny that the author gave that kind of ending but for me, the real lesson there was the characters' lack of communication that made them have the decision of giving gifts which might eventually not be of use but the thought of it though is way bigger and what readers should pay attention to.</p><p>How I connect to the text------ personally, I am a giver by nature and I relate to the characters of this text. Although one might mistakenly look at giving as means to receive something in return. For me.. In giving is where you receive. God pays attention one might not realize. In the text, there love for each other is so big that they display the meaning of the word "selfless</p><br />
