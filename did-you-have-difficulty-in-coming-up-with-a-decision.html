                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong>There was a time when I had to make a decision was when I had to decide whether to take choose my mom or my dad. They got separated and since I am an only child I had to choose whom I am going with. I thought deeply of the situation. If I go with my mom then my dad will be sad and If I chose my dad, my mom will be devastated. It was a tough decision for me because I love both of them. I considered a lot of things like what if they both get married again who would be the best person to protect me if ever their partners aren't that nice to me. However, I still chose my mom, because I know that she will do her best to give everything to me. She would protect me at all costs.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>#BRAINLYFAST </strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>ETHICAL DECISION MAKING PROCESS
</p><p>1. Gather the facts
</p><p>2. Define the ethical issues
</p><p>3. Identify the affected parties (stakeholders)
</p><p>4. Identify the consequences
</p><p>5. Identify the obligations (principles, rights, justice)
</p><p>6. Consider your character and integrity
</p><p>7. Think creatively about potential actions
</p><p>8. Check your gut
</p><p>9. Decide on the proper ethical action and be prepared to 
</p><p>deal with opposing arguments.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>1. Don’t jump to conclusions without the facts
</p><p> Questions to ask: Who, what, where, when, how, and 
</p><p>why.
</p><p> However, facts may be difficult to find because of the 
</p><p>uncertainty often found around ethical issues
</p><p> Some facts are not available
</p><p> Assemble as many facts as possible before proceeding
</p><p> Clarify what assumptions you are making!</p><p>2. Don’t jump to solutions without first identifying the ethical 
</p><p>issue(s) in the situation.
</p><p> Define the ethical basis for the issue you want to focus on.
</p><p> There may be multiple ethical issues – focus on one major 
</p><p>one at a time.</p><p>3. Identify all of the stakeholders
</p><p> Who are the primary or direct stakeholders?
</p><p> Who are the secondary or indirect stakeholders?
</p><p> Why are they stakeholders for the issue?
</p><p> Perspective-taking -- Try to see things through the eyes 
</p><p>of those individuals affected. </p><p>4.  Think about potential positive and negative consequences for affected 
</p><p>parties by the decision (Focus on primary stakeholders to simplify 
</p><p>analysis until you become comfortable with the process).
</p><p> What are the magnitude of the consequences and the probability that 
</p><p>the consequences will happen.
</p><p> Short term vs. Long term consequences – will decision be valid over 
</p><p>time.
</p><p> Broader systemic consequences – tied to symbolic and secrecy
</p><p> Symbolic consequences – Each decision sends a message.
</p><p> Secrecy consequences – What are the consequences if the decision 
</p><p>or action becomes public?
</p><p> Did you consider relevant cognitive barriers/biases?
</p><p> Consider what your decision would be based only on consequences –
</p><p>then move on and see if it is similar given other considerations</p><p>5. Obligations should be thought of in terms of principles and rights involved
</p><p> A) What obligations are created because of particular ethical principles
</p><p>you might use in the situation? 
</p><p> Examples: Do no harm; Do unto others as you would have them do 
</p><p>unto you; Do what you would have anyone in your shoes do in the 
</p><p>given context.
</p><p> B) What obligations are created because of the specific rights of the 
</p><p>stakeholders?
</p><p> What rights are more basic vs. secondary in nature? Which help protect 
</p><p>an individual’s basic autonomy?
</p><p> What types of rights are involved – negative or positive?
</p><p> C) What concepts of justice (fairness) are relevant – distributive or 
</p><p>procedural justice?
</p><p> Did you consider any relevant cognitive barriers/biases?
</p><p> Formulate the appropriate decision or action based solely on the above 
</p><p>analysis of these obligations.</p><p>6. Consider what your relevant community members would 
</p><p>consider to be the kind of decision that an individual of 
</p><p>integrity would make in this situation.
</p><p> What specific virtues are relevant in the situation?
</p><p> Disclosure rule – what would you do if the New York Times
</p><p>reported your action and everyone was to read it.
</p><p> Think about how your decision will be remembered when 
</p><p>you are gone.
</p><p> Did you consider any relevant cognitive biases/barriers?
</p><p> What decision would you come to based solely on 
</p><p>character considerations?</p><p>7. Be sure you have not been unnecessarily forced into a 
</p><p>corner
</p><p> You may have some choices or alternatives that have not 
</p><p>been considered
</p><p> If you have come up with solutions “a” and “b,” try to 
</p><p>brainstorm and come up with a “c” solution that might 
</p><p>satisfy the interests of the primary parties involved in the 
</p><p>situation.</p><p>8. Even though the prior steps have argued for a highly 
</p><p>rational process, it is always good to “check your gut.”
</p><p> Intuition is gaining credibility as a source for good 
</p><p>decision making – knowing something is not “right.”
</p><p>• Particularly relevant if you have a lot of experience in 
</p><p>the area – expert decision-making.</p><p>9. Consider potential actions based on the consequences, 
</p><p>obligations, and character approaches.
</p><p> Do you come up with similar answers from the different 
</p><p>perspectives?
</p><p> Do the obligation and character help you “check” the 
</p><p>consequentialist preferred action? 
</p><p> How can you protect the rights of those involved (or your 
</p><p>own character) while still maximizing the overall good for 
</p><p>all of the stakeholders?
</p><p> What arguments are most compelling to you to justify the 
</p><p>action ethically? How will you respond to those with 
</p><p>opposing viewpoints?</p><br />

                        Answer<p><strong>It is because Art is viewed in a personal way.</strong> Meaning, the interpretation of art will differ based on a person's experience, personal preferences, intelligence, creativity, emotions, personality, culture, etc. So, sometimes, two people may disagree on the definition of art, while others will have an agreement on the meaning of Art. Therefore, it is safe to say that Art really doesn't have a very single definition because of the different points of view. </p><p></p><p><strong>Learning Visual Elements -</strong> https://brainly.ph/question/2809402</p><p>#BrainlyFast</p><br />

</strong></p><p><strong>2. Did you have alternative options? what are these?</strong></p><p><strong>Answer: </strong>Option and choice are commonly used interchangeably, but an alternative is an option or choice that stands "instead of the other."1 As a result, when presented with multiple options (choices), a person will always have one more option than alternatives.</p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>3. Did your household members have different options? how did you deal with it?</strong></p><p><strong>Answer: </strong>It is determined by the members of your own household.</p><p><strong>

Does it help to analyze your alternative and the consequence of your decisions?​</strong></p><p><strong>Answer: </strong>After a decision maker has successfully and accurately defined the problem and generated alternatives, he or she can conduct analysis to evaluate and assess each.  The first step in analysis is to identify all of the data sources required to comprehend the various alternatives and their potential outcomes.</p><p>Decision makers use information gathered by defining the problem to generate alternatives. The quality of the data determines how good, complete, and accurate the list of alternatives is. The alternatives identified serve as the foundation for subsequent analysis and, ultimately, the decision.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Learn the difference between individual decision-making and group-making: https://brainly.ph/question/20270520</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>#BrainlyEveryday</strong></p><br />
