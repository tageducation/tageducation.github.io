                                            F. Make judgement on the values of the characters in the story “The Pardoner’s Tale” and on the values of the people in the Article above. Focus on the most essential values that should have been acceptable before and in modern society. Explain your answer and write it on the space provided. The Pardoner’s Taleby: Geoffrey ChaucerThe Pardoner describes a group of young Flemish people who spend their time drinking and reveling, indulging in all forms of excess. After commenting on their lifestyle of debauchery, the Pardoner enters into a tirade against the vices that they practice. First and foremost is gluttony, which he identifies as the sin that first caused the fall of mankind in Eden. Next, he attacks drunkenness, which makes a man seem mad and witless. Next is gambling, the temptation that ruins men of power and wealth. Finally, he denounces swearing. He argues that it so offends God that he forbade swearing in the Second Commandment—placing it higher up on the list than homicide. After almost two hundred lines of sermonizing, the Pardoner finally returns to his story of the lecherous Flemish youngsters.As three of these rioters sit drinking, they hear a funeral knell. One of the reveler’s servants tells the group that an old friend of theirs was slain that very night by a mysterious figure named Death. The rioters are outraged and, in their drunkenness, decide to find and kill Death to avenge their friend. Traveling down the road, they meet an old man who appears sorrowful. He says his sorrow stems from old age—he has been waiting for Death to come and take him for some time, and he has wandered all over the world. The youths, hearing the name of Death, demand to know where they can find him. The old man directs them into a grove, where he says he just left Death under an oak tree. The rioters rush to the tree, underneath which they find not Death but eight bushels of gold coins with no owner in sight.At first, they are speechless, but, then, the youngest of the three reminds them that if they carry the gold into town in daylight, they will be taken for thieves. They must transport the gold under cover of night, and so someone must run into town to fetch bread and wine in the meantime. They draw lots, and the youngest of the three loses and runs off toward town. As soon as he is gone, the sly plotter turns to his friend and divulges his plan: when their friend returns from town, they will kill him and therefore receive greater shares of the wealth. The second rioter agrees, and they prepare their trap. Back in town, the youngest vagrant is having similar thoughts. He could easily be the richest man in town, he realizes, if he could have all the gold to himself. He goes to the apothecary and buys the strongest poison available, then puts the poison into two bottles of wine, leaving a third bottle pure for himself. He returns to the tree, but the other two rioters leap out and kill him.They sit down to drink their friend’s wine and celebrate, but each happens to pick up a poisoned bottle. Within minutes, they lie dead next to their friend. Thus, concludes the Pardoner, all must beware the sin of avarice, which can only bring treachery and death. He realizes that he has forgotten something: he has relics and pardons in his bag. According to his custom, he tells the pilgrims the value of his relics and asks for contributions—even though he has just told them the relics are fake. He offers the Host the first chance to come forth and kiss the relics, since the Host is clearly the most enveloped in sin. The Host is outraged and proposes to make a relic out of the Pardoner’s genitals, but the Knight calms everybody down. The Host and Pardoner kiss and make up, and all have a good laugh as they continue on their way.please don't answer if you don't really know the answer.​</a>

                                            Directions: Read and analyze the sample text and answer the following question.  How long have you been in quarantine since the coronavirus disease pandemic was declared? What are your thoughts about being quarantined and the COVID19 itself? Here is one creative nonfiction work about it. Hello Corona (by Millind, March 24, 2020)  Hello Corona,    No, I will not call you novel or any such thing. You are a monster that has claimed thousands of lives and infected hundreds of thousands of people across the world and there is no sign of your taming down yet. But you must be the happiest creature in the world these days. After all, you have brought the entire mankind who considered themselves the most superior to all other beings, to their knees. Proud for our superior intellect, ingenuity and technological development over past so many centuries, nearly the entire world except emergency service providers has been locked at home now. We constructed large and beautiful bridges, built monumental towers, statues and sacred places for worship which people visited for centuries. All those places are deserted now.We made airplanes and travelled in each corner of the world. We developed astronomical science, built rockets and travelled in space; we even set our footprint on the moon. But now we are afraid of even stepping outside our homes and you deserve the entire (dis)credit for this. Who are you in reality, Corona… are you a message from the nature that we’ve been ignoring for several decades or maybe, centuries? Are you a blow to us from the nature against whom we tried to prove ourselves superior? We were told time and again that we are part of the entire universal ecosystem and whatever development we make; it should be harmonious with this ecosystem so that life on the planet remains unaffected. We did not listen to this advice and you are probably the result of our misdeeds.Each phase of life, however pleasant or difficult, must pass and a new dawn must arrive. I sincerely hope that after causing so much harm to the mankind, you will go away by doing some good to us and make a few positive changes in our lives. Though you have built walls between us and our loved ones by isolating us, I hope that you will destroy walls of castes, religions and languages eventually as people will now realize that worth of a human life is much more than these manmade things. Capitalists are the ones who contribute immensely to our economic growth and provide millions of jobs. But they, at times, become so much profit hungry that they flout environmental norms and foster corruption to satisfy their profit motive. I hope that they will now realize that humanity is above everything and set their priorities accordingly. I hope that countries in the world will come closer in solidarity in the present situation and feuding nations will look for peaceful solutions to disputes between them rather than speaking the language of revenge and destruction. I hope that people in our country will become more hygiene conscious – not just on a personal level, but also in public places such that they maintain cleanliness everywhere. I also hope that our people will grow up with this experience and set their priorities to buy products with good quality rather than just buying cheap products, though this is not directly related to being infected by you. I expect them to value worth of manual labor and treat manual workers respectfully, ensuring their safety. This is crucial because when we interact with these workers, we are sure that we are dealing with hygienic people.Over the years, as medical science developed, our life span increased, and we started taking things for granted. Our approach to life became very rigid and unilateral. We didn’t care if life had something to talk to us…it did have a lot to tell us which is appearing now in your form and shape. It has been our belief for many centuries that we are fully evolved beings. You proved us wrong a hard way and made realize that we are still evolving, and the process of evolution is never complete for which, I thank you. We humans are innovative and intelligent. I’m sure, a vaccine on your infection will be shortly developed and your fear will be wiped out. But as you go, I only hope that you will teach us some good lessons of life that will prevent your younger siblings from entering our lives in years to come. Keep you in the track…    1) What is the text about? 2) From what point of view is the text written? Would it make a difference if the text were written from a different perspective? Why or why not? 3) What are the factual/nonfictional aspects present in the passage? 4) What are the creative aspects of the text? What makes you say so?​</a>

                                            A rainbow is a multicolored arc made by light striking water droplets. The most familiar type of rainbow is produced whensunlight strikes raindrops in front of a viewer at a precise angle (42 degrees). Rainbows can also be viewed around fog, sea spray,or waterfalls. A rainbow is an optical illusion—it does not actually exist in a specific spot in the sky. The appearance of a rainbowdepends on where you're standing and where the sun (or other source of light) is shining. The sun or other source of light is usuallybehind the person seeing the rainbow. In fact, the center of a primary rainbow is the antisolar point, the imaginary point exactlyopposite the sun.Rainbows are the result of the refraction and reflection of light. Both refraction and reflection are phenomena that involve achange in a wave's direction. A refracted wave may appear "bent", while a reflected wave might seem to "bounce back" from asurface or other wavefront.Light entering a water droplet is refracted. It is then reflected by the back of the droplet. As this reflectedlight leaves the droplet, it is refracted again, at multiple angles.The radius of a rainbow is determined by the water droplets' refractive index. A refractive index is the measure of how much aray of light refracts (bends) as it passes from one medium to another—from air to water, for example. A droplet with a high refractiveindex will help produce a rainbow with a smaller radius. Saltwater has a higher refractive index than freshwater, for instance, sorainbows formed by sea spray will be smaller than rainbows formed by rain.Rainbows are actually full circles. The antisolar point isthe center of the circle. Viewers in aircraft can sometimes see these circular rainbows.Viewers on the ground can only see the light reflected by raindrops above the horizon. Because each person's horizon is a littledifferent, no one actually sees a full rainbow from the ground. In fact, no one sees the same rainbow—each person has a differentantisolar point, each person has a different horizon. Someone who appears below or near the "end" of a rainbow to one viewer willsee another rainbow, extending from his or her own horizon.Guide Question1.Visible light waves are the only magnetic waves we can see.

                                            Instruction: Congratulations for making it this far! You’re almost done. Before you proceed to your next lesson, let us test your mastery. Today’s task is to read the following paragraphs and determine which pattern of development in writing is used. Are you ready? Here are the paragraphs. 1. Caring for yourself during these times is also caring for others. When we are allowed to go outside our houses, we should obey health practices. Some are skeptic about wearing masks. Others are still in doubt when asked to wash hands often or use alcohol and sanitizer. There are also people who question the need to maintain distance from each other in public areas. These safety measures are set because they are proven to be helpful in preventing the spread of the virus. They are not mere wishes to make our lives difficult. We are asked to do these health protocols because we are still in danger with the rising number of COVID-19 cases. Be responsible for yourself so that you will not be the reason for others to catch the virus. If you care for your loved ones, you must take care of yourself first. You do not want to be the one bringing the virus to your home. 2. The word quarantine is such a familiar one to almost everyone who are aware of the pandemic today. According to the Merriam- Webster dictionary online, it is a noun that has several meanings. It states that it is a period of 40 days. It may also be a term during which a ship arriving in port and suspected of carrying contagious disease is held in isolation from the shore. Also, it means a restraint upon the activities or communication of persons or the transport of goods designed to prevent the spread of disease or pests. It is also defined as a state of enforced isolation. For us, who have been in community quarantine for more or less three months, we know that quarantine means staying at home and waiting for the situation to be better. It is a condition wherein only those who have quarantine pass are allowed to go out for essential needs of the family. For others, the concept quarantine may also be equated to “no work, no pay” policy. Some may define it as something needed for people who are sick or those who came from places with COVID-19 cases. On the other hand, some probably sees quarantine as something that takes away their right to see family, relatives and friends. To sum it up, whatever or however we understand quarantine, we need to follow it as a safety protocol since we are still fighting this pandemic. 3. There are several similarities and differences between being a senior and junior high school student. Being a senior and junior high school student, both require you to study hard to be able to get desirable outputs and decent grades. Subjects are equally important to be given attention. It’s just that some subject areas may be easier to deal with depending on different factors. The subjects in senior high school (SHS) and junior high school (JHS) differ in a way that SHS subjects are more specific areas that are deemed essential for the track and strand you chose while in JHS, subjects are the general ones that we have since first grade, just increasing in complexity. Another similarity is that when you enter SHS and JHS, you have to prepare yourself to be a responsible part of the institution that you will enroll in. You should be ready to follow the policy that the school implements. Being a “senior” high student doesn’t mean you are superior or anything and being a “junior” high student doesn’t mean that you are under those in the SHS. The difference comes when there may be slight changes in the way rules and regulations are applied and the gravity of reprimands you may receive as you step up to higher grade levels or as you encounter different situations. In general, whether there are similarity or difference in being a Senior or Junior high school student, it’s is still up to you how you will handle it.​</a>

                                            Story:Death of a Salesman (Summary) A stage play written by Arthur Miller Willy Loman returns home exhausted after a business trip he has cancelled. Worried over Willy's state of mind and recent car accident, his wife Linda suggests that he ask his boss Howard Wagner to allow him to work in his home city so he will not have to travel. Willy complains to Linda that their son, Biff, has yet to do something with his life. Despite Biff's potential as a football star in high school, he failed in mathematics and was therefore unable to enter a university. Biff and his younger brother, Happy, who is temporarily staying with Willy and Linda after Biff's unexpected return from the West, reminisce about their childhood together. They discuss their father's mental degeneration, which they have witnessed in the form of his constant indecisiveness and daydreaming about the boys' high school years. Eventually, Willy walks in, angry that the two boys have never amounted to anything. In an effort to pacify their father, Biff and Happy tell him that Biff plans to make a business proposition the next day. The next day, Willy goes to ask Howard for a job in town while Biff goes to make a business proposition, but they both fail; Willy gets angry and ends up getting fired when Howard tells him he needs a rest and can no longer represent the company, while Biff waits hours to see a former employer who does not remember him and turns him down. Biff impulsively steals a fountain pen. Willy then goes to the office of his neighbor Charley, where he runs into Charley's son Bernard, now a successful lawyer. Bernard tells him that Biff originally wanted to go to summer school to make up for failing math, but something happened in Boston when Biff went to visit his father that changed his mind. Charley gives the now-unemployed Willy money to pay his life-insurance premium, and Willy shocks Charley by remarking that ultimately, a man is "worth more dead than alive." Happy, Biff, and Willy meet for dinner at a restaurant, but Willy refuses to hear bad news from Biff. Happy tries to get Biff to lie to their father. Biff tries to tell him what happened as Willy gets angry and slips into a flashback of what happened in Boston the day Biff came to see him: Willy had been in Boston for work, and Biff went to visit him to ask Willy to convince his teacher to curve Biff's failing math grade. Willy was in the middle of an affair with a receptionist, when Biff arrived unexpectedly at the hotel room, and saw the woman, who was half-dressed. Willy attempted to explain away her presence as an innocent borrowing of his shower, while her own room was undergoing renovations, but Biff is unconvinced and angrily dismisses Willie as a liar and a fake before storming out. From that moment, Biff's views of his father changed and set him adrift. Biff leaves the restaurant in frustration, followed by Happy and two girls that Happy picked up, leaving a confused and upset Willy behind. When they later return home, Linda angrily confronts them for abandoning their father while Willy remains outside, talking to himself. Biff tries to reconcile with Willy, but the discussion quickly escalates into another argument. Biff conveys plainly to his father that he is not meant for anything great, insisting that both of them are simply ordinary men meant to lead ordinary lives. The argument reaches an apparent climax as Biff hugs Willy and begins to cry as he tries to get Willy to let go of his unrealistic expectations. Rather than listen to what Biff actually says, Willy appears to believe his son has forgiven him and will follow in his footsteps, and after Linda goes upstairs to bed, lapses one final time into a hallucination, thinking he is talking to his long-dead brother Ben. In Willy's mind, Ben approves of the scheme Willy has dreamed up to kill himself in order to give Biff his insurance policy money. Willy exits the house, and Biff and Linda cry out in despair as the sound of Willy's car blares up and fades out. The final scene takes place at Willy's funeral, which is attended only by his family, Charley and Bernard. The ambiguities of mixed and unaddressed emotions persist, particularly over whether Willy's choices or circumstances were obsolete. At the funeral, Biff retains his belief that he does not want to become a businessman like his father. Happy, on the other hand, chooses to follow in his father's footsteps, while Linda laments her husband's decision just before her final payment on the house. QUESTION:1. How would you describe Willy as a father?2. What can you tell about the relationship of the family to each other?3. What led Willy to commit suicide? Is there a way that this could have been avoided? ​</a>

                                            Once upon a time, in a far-off land, there was a powerful wizard named Alaric who was known for his incredible magic skills. He lived alone in a tall tower, hidden deep within the enchanted forest, and very few people had ever seen him.One day, a young girl named Lily stumbled upon Alaric's tower while exploring the forest. She was amazed by its beauty and decided to enter. As soon as she stepped inside, Alaric appeared before her.Lily was frightened at first, but Alaric was friendly and welcomed her inside. He was impressed by her courage and decided to teach her some magic tricks.As time went by, Lily learned more and more from Alaric, and they became close friends. She discovered that Alaric was actually a kind-hearted wizard who had been hiding from the world because he feared his power could be used for evil.One day, an evil sorcerer named Malakar arrived in the enchanted forest, and he was determined to destroy everything in his path. He had an army of dark creatures that obeyed his every command, and they began to terrorize the forest.Alaric and Lily knew they had to do something to stop Malakar, so they set out to gather the bravest warriors and wizards from all across the land. They formed a powerful army and marched into battle against Malakar and his minions.The battle was long and grueling, and it seemed like all hope was lost. But just when things were looking their bleakest, Lily remembered a spell that Alaric had taught her, and she used it to create a giant shield that protected the army from Malakar's attacks.With the shield in place, the army was able to regroup and launch a final attack against Malakar. Alaric used his most powerful magic to defeat the evil sorcerer, and the dark creatures disappeared back into the shadows.After the battle, Lily and Alaric were hailed as heroes, and they continued to teach magic to those who wished to learn. They became known as the protectors of the enchanted forest, and their legend lived on for generations to come.Question:1. What is the name of the wizard in the story?2. Where does Alaric live?3.

He had grown old and could not run fast anymore. As days went by it became more and more difficult for him to hunt.One day while he was wandering through the forest in search of food, he came across a cave. He peeped in and smelt the air inside the cave. “Some animal must be staying here," he said to himself. He crept inside the cave only to find it empty. “I will hide inside and wait for the animal to return," he thought.The cave was the home of a jackal. Everyday, the jackal would go out in search of food and return to the cave in the evening to rest. That evening, the jackal after having his meal started towards home. But as he came closer, he felt something wrong. Everything around him very quiet. “Something is wrong," the jackal said to himself. “Why are all the birds and insects so silent?"Very slowly and cautiously, he walked towards his cave. He looked around him, watching for any signs of danger. As he got closer to the mouth of the cave, all his instincts alerted him of danger. “I have to make sure that everything is alright," thought the jackal. Suddenly, he thought of a plan.The clever jackal called out to the cave. “Hello my good cave, what happened to you today? Why are you so quiet?"The jackal’s voice echoed deep inside the cave. The lion, who by now could control his hunger no longer, thought to himself, “I think it is because I am here that the cave is silent. Before the jackal realises that something is wrong, I should do something."The jackal continued to call out, “Have you forgotten our agreement cave? You are supposed to greet me when I return home." The lion tried to make his voice sound hollow and called out from within the cave, “Welcome home my friend."The birds chirped loudly and flew away on hearing the lion’s roar. As for the jackal, he shook with fear. Before the hungry lion could pounce on him and eat him up, the jackal ran for his dear life as fast as his legs could carry him.The lion waited for a long while for the jackal to enter the cave. But when the jackal did not come in, the lion realised that he had been fooled. He cursed himself for his foolishness that made him lose a prey.​</a>

Write your answer on the box provided.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The Pardoner’s Taleby: Geoffrey ChaucerThe Pardoner describes a group of young Flemish people who spend their time drinking and reveling, indulging in all forms of excess. After commenting on their lifestyle of debauchery, the Pardoner enters into a tirade against the vices that they practice. First and foremost is gluttony, which he identifies as the sin that first caused the fall of mankind in Eden. Next, he attacks drunkenness, which makes a man seem mad and witless. Next is gambling, the temptation that ruins men of power and wealth. Finally, he denounces swearing. He argues that it so offends God that he forbade swearing in the Second Commandment—placing it higher up on the list than homicide. After almost two hundred lines of sermonizing, the Pardoner finally returns to his story of the lecherous Flemish youngsters.	As three of these rioters sit drinking, they hear a funeral knell. One of the reveler’s servants tells the group that an old friend of theirs was slain that very night by a mysterious figure named Death. The rioters are outraged and, in their drunkenness, decide to find and kill Death to avenge their friend. Traveling down the road, they meet an old man who appears sorrowful. He says his sorrow stems from old age—he has been waiting for Death to come and take him for some time, and he has wandered all over the world. The youths, hearing the name of Death, demand to know where they can find him. The old man directs them into a grove, where he says he just left Death under an oak tree. The rioters rush to the tree, underneath which they find not Death but eight bushels of gold coins with no owner in sight.	At first, they are speechless, but, then, the youngest of the three reminds them that if they carry the gold into town in daylight, they will be taken for thieves. They must transport the gold under cover of night, and so someone must run into town to fetch bread and wine in the meantime. They draw lots, and the youngest of the three loses and runs off toward town. As soon as he is gone, the sly plotter turns to his friend and divulges his plan: when their friend returns from town, they will kill him and therefore receive greater shares of the wealth. The second rioter agrees, and they prepare their trap. Back in town, the youngest vagrant is having similar thoughts. He could easily be the richest man in town, he realizes, if he could have all the gold to himself. He goes to the apothecary and buys the strongest poison available, then puts the poison into two bottles of wine, leaving a third bottle pure for himself. He returns to the tree, but the other two rioters leap out and kill him.	They sit down to drink their friend’s wine and celebrate, but each happens to pick up a poisoned bottle. Within minutes, they lie dead next to their friend. Thus, concludes the Pardoner, all must beware the sin of avarice, which can only bring treachery and death. He realizes that he has forgotten something: he has relics and pardons in his bag. According to his custom, he tells the pilgrims the value of his relics and asks for contributions—even though he has just told them the relics are fake. He offers the Host the first chance to come forth and kiss the relics, since the Host is clearly the most enveloped in sin. The Host is outraged and proposes to make a relic out of the Pardoner’s genitals, but the Knight calms everybody down. The Host and Pardoner kiss and make up, and all have a good laugh as they continue on their way.​</a>

I believe a man should be prepared at all times to sacrifice everything for his convictions. Twice during my life I have been called upon to make this kind of sacrifice. After Pearl Harbor, the Philippines was invaded by Japan. I had never been a soldier. I was a journalist. But something impelled me to enlist. I was attached to General MacArthur’s staff and went with him first to Bataan and later to Corregidor. In Corregidor, I was placed in charge of the broadcast called Voice of Freedom. The Japanese reacted violently to the broadcast. I learned that a prize had been put on my head, and worse that they had gone after my wife and four sons who had been left behind in the occupied territory. I suffered indescribable torment, worrying about my loved ones. I wanted to go back to Manila at whatever cost. But I was order to proceed to Australia on the eve of the fall of Bataan. From Australia, I was sent on to the United States, where I continued to make the Voice of Freedom heard, regardless of the consequenSeeeneral MacArthur, aided by Filipino guerillas who had carried on a vigorous resistance during the more than three years of enemy occupation. The second I was called upon to make considerable sacrifice for my convictions was during 1953 national elections in the Philippines. I had never been a politician, but having become convince that I should do everything I could to help effect a change of government in my country, I resigned as Ambassador to the United States and permanent representative to the United Nations in order to enter the field against the incumbent president— started a vigorous campaign to awaken the Filipino people to the need for a change in administration. Midway in the campaign, it became apparent that the two opposition parties might lose the election if they remained divided, but had an excellent chance to win if they present a united front. I made the painful decision to withdraw my candidacy. After withdrawing my own candidacy, I was the campaign manager of Mr. Ramon Magsaysay and campaigned up and down the land for him. i could not have worked harder if I had been the candidate myself. Magsaysay won by a landslide. The temptation was strong for all those who had worked for him to share in the rewards of victory. I was convinced, however, that the first duty of everyone who had helped to bring about a change of government was to give the new president a completely free hand in making appointments to keep positions in his administration. Immediately after the elections, I left for the United States.​</a>

                                            Summarize the Story in 5-10 sentencesTHE HEROISM OF BERNARDO CARPIOOnce upon a time, there was a couple who lived in one of the many mountains of San Mateo, Rizal. The man and the woman were very poor and led a very hard life. But one day, amidst all their poverty and hardships, came a bundle of joy and happiness. The man and the woman were given the gift of the birth of a big, beautiful, and healthy baby boy. They named their newborn son Bernardo Carpio and he became his parents’ most precious treasure.Like any other kid, Bernardo loved to play. But something was noticeably very different about Bernardo. Unlike the other kids, Bernardo had the power of extraordinary strength.It was said that when Bernardo was still a baby crawling on all fours, all the floorboard nails that he hooked with his tiny fingernails were pulled out from their very places. When Bernardo was still learning how to walk, any railing that he used for support was destroyed and splintered into pieces. And anytime Bernardo’s parents gave him a new toy to play with, the toy would break and become crushed in the palms of his small hands.As Bernardo grew up to be a handsome young man, his power doubled and increased even more. He soon became renowned not only for his power of extraordinary strength, but also for his dashing good looks. Furthermore, Bernardo possessed great courage and bravery that were second to none. Everyone knew that Bernardo could easily beat any man so no one would dare face Bernardo Carpio in a match of strength and bravery.Not like other typical guys, Bernardo was not interested in merriment, social gatherings, and other festivities. The loveliness of all the beautiful young women in his town did not appeal to him. What really captivated Bernardo was the forest.Bernardo found his real happiness in the forest. The part where the trees were the thickest and the densest is where he often stayed. There is where he spent time with and sought the company of his close friends, the animals of the forest.In the forest that Bernardo frequented lived an enchanted creature. This enchanted creature was a very big and a very strong male. However, the creature also had the ugly manner of envying and causing harm to others. The enchanted creature had seen Bernardo many times during the innumerable visits that he had made to the forest.It did not take long before the begrudging and hateful enchanted creature got wind of Bernardo’s fame for his extraordinary strength. The enchanted creature was sure that the young man would be no match against his own power and strength. One day, the enchanted creature waited for Bernardo to come into the forest. As soon as he saw Bernardo, he immediately challenged him to a duel. Bernardo was not one to back down from any fight so he accepted the challenge right away.And so the two fought. This was followed by many different battles in which both of them made use of their power of great strength. And in every single one of them, the enchanted creature lost.They separated after a long and arduous battle. The enchanted creature left but not without hatred in his heart for the one that defeated him. He waited for the right time and the right opportunity to exact revenge on Bernardo for the loss and shame that he had suffered in his hands.When the enchanted creature was able to chance upon Bernardo once again, he invited him to a hidden area of the forest. In that area were two enormous slabs of stone that were positioned on either side of the place. In the middle of those two stone slabs was where the enchanted creature dwelled. The creature told Bernardo to go ahead and enter the place. As soon as Bernardo reached the spot right in the center of the two stones, the enchanted creature vanished into thin air. And suddenly, the two stone slabs started to fall towards Bernardo. Using his extraordinary strength, Bernardo fought against the stones’ massive weight and size to prevent them from crushing him.According to the elders, Bernardo Carpio is still in the same place, holding those two stones. And every time an earthquake occurs, it is said that it is because of Bernardo Carpio moving and wishing to break free.I'm very sorry that this is Long</a>

                                            Read the selection below. Then answer the questions correctly. It is bad to have food stuck between your teeth for long periods of time. This is because food attracts germs, germs produce acid, and acid hurts your teeth and gums. Flossing helps to remove the food that gets stuck between your teeth. This explains why flossing helps to keep your mouth healthy, but some doctors say that flossing can be also good for your heart. It may seem strange that something you do for your teeth can have any effect on your heart. Doctors have come up with a few ideas about how flossing works to keep your heart healthy. One idea is that the germs that hurt your teeth can leave the mouth and travel into your blood. Germs that get into the blood can then attack your heart. Another idea is because when there are too many germs in your mouth, the body tries to fight against these germs. For some reason, the way the body fights these mouth germs may end up weakening the heart over time. Not every doctor agrees about these ideas. Some doctors think that the link between good flossing habits and good heart health is only a coincidence. A coincidence is the occurrence of two or more events at one time apparently by mere chance. The incidence of these events is completely random, as they do not admit of any reliable cause and effect relationship between them. For example, every time I wash my car, it rains. This does not mean that when I wash my car, I somehow change the weather. This is only a coincidence. Likewise, some doctors think that people who have bad flossing habits just happen to also have heart problems, and people who have good flossing habits just happen to have healthy hearts. The theory that flossing your teeth helps to keep your heart healthy might not be true. But every doctor agrees that flossing is a great way to keep your teeth healthy. So even if flossing does not help your heart, it is sure to help your teeth. This is enough of a reason for everyone to floss their teeth every day.41. Which of the following is the most appropriate title for this passage? A. Why Doctors Disagree about Flossing B. How to Keep Your Teeth Healthy C. Flossing Your Way to a Healthy Heart D. Flossing by Coincidence 42. How flossing effectively keeps your mouth healthy?

                                            A hotel has and had a series of walk-outs, which have become the main topic of conversation at departmental management meetings. The most recent has been investigated fairly thoroughly, and the following facts have emerged. The clients (a couple and three children) checked out in one evening at around 9:30pm. They were chance bookings, but the receptionist took a deposit for the first night’s accommodation and tax. When the morning shift arrived they enter the booking onto the computer, since it had not been done the night before. At 5:00am the housekeeper reported that they had not vacated the room, so a message was left on the system for them to call reception. The hotel was not full, so it was not really a problem. When the family arrived backed in, they called reception, and said they wanted to stay until the weekend, so their stay was extended, and all the departments were advised of the departure date. The hall porter reported that they had been very friendly, had been on several trips, and always appeared very pleasant. The restaurant staff said they always added a tip when they signed the bill, and most staff were eager were eager to serve them. The housekeeper said the room was usually quite tidy, although they had very little luggage for a relatively large family, who were staying (she was told) until the end of the month. In public relations they were anxious to please this family, since he worked for a well-known company, whose business would be a great asset to the hotel if they could get this client to recommend them. The bar manager reported that, ‘The gentleman liked a drink, but never brought the children down. He usually sent them and his wife something upstairs and put it on the bill.’ By the time the family walked out they had accumulated a large bill and several different stories had grown up around them. Tasks (20 pts.) 1.1 List the departments that were at fault in this scenario. 1.2 Write a report for the general manager explaining how this could have happened. 1.3 List the departments that were not involved but should have been. 1.4 Outline ways in which this situation could be avoided again. ​</a>

Focus on the most essential values that should have been acceptable before and in modern society. Explain your answer and write it on the space provided. The Pardoner’s Taleby: Geoffrey ChaucerThe Pardoner describes a group of young Flemish people who spend their time drinking and reveling, indulging in all forms of excess. After commenting on their lifestyle of debauchery, the Pardoner enters into a tirade against the vices that they practice. First and foremost is gluttony, which he identifies as the sin that first caused the fall of mankind in Eden. Next, he attacks drunkenness, which makes a man seem mad and witless. Next is gambling, the temptation that ruins men of power and wealth. Finally, he denounces swearing. He argues that it so offends God that he forbade swearing in the Second Commandment—placing it higher up on the list than homicide. After almost two hundred lines of sermonizing, the Pardoner finally returns to his story of the lecherous Flemish youngsters.As three of these rioters sit drinking, they hear a funeral knell. One of the reveler’s servants tells the group that an old friend of theirs was slain that very night by a mysterious figure named Death. The rioters are outraged and, in their drunkenness, decide to find and kill Death to avenge their friend. Traveling down the road, they meet an old man who appears sorrowful. He says his sorrow stems from old age—he has been waiting for Death to come and take him for some time, and he has wandered all over the world. The youths, hearing the name of Death, demand to know where they can find him. The old man directs them into a grove, where he says he just left Death under an oak tree. The rioters rush to the tree, underneath which they find not Death but eight bushels of gold coins with no owner in sight.At first, they are speechless, but, then, the youngest of the three reminds them that if they carry the gold into town in daylight, they will be taken for thieves. They must transport the gold under cover of night, and so someone must run into town to fetch bread and wine in the meantime. They draw lots, and the youngest of the three loses and runs off toward town. As soon as he is gone, the sly plotter turns to his friend and divulges his plan: when their friend returns from town, they will kill him and therefore receive greater shares of the wealth. The second rioter agrees, and they prepare their trap. Back in town, the youngest vagrant is having similar thoughts. He could easily be the richest man in town, he realizes, if he could have all the gold to himself. He goes to the apothecary and buys the strongest poison available, then puts the poison into two bottles of wine, leaving a third bottle pure for himself. He returns to the tree, but the other two rioters leap out and kill him.They sit down to drink their friend’s wine and celebrate, but each happens to pick up a poisoned bottle. Within minutes, they lie dead next to their friend. Thus, concludes the Pardoner, all must beware the sin of avarice, which can only bring treachery and death. He realizes that he has forgotten something: he has relics and pardons in his bag. According to his custom, he tells the pilgrims the value of his relics and asks for contributions—even though he has just told them the relics are fake. He offers the Host the first chance to come forth and kiss the relics, since the Host is clearly the most enveloped in sin. The Host is outraged and proposes to make a relic out of the Pardoner’s genitals, but the Knight calms everybody down. The Host and Pardoner kiss and make up, and all have a good laugh as they continue on their way.please don't answer if you don't really know the answer.​</h2><br />

                            6. Directions: Read and analyze the sample text and answer the following question.  How long have you been in quarantine since the coronavirus disease pandemic was declared? What are your thoughts about being quarantined and the COVID19 itself? Here is one creative nonfiction work about it. Hello Corona (by Millind, March 24, 2020)  Hello Corona,    No, I will not call you novel or any such thing. You are a monster that has claimed thousands of lives and infected hundreds of thousands of people across the world and there is no sign of your taming down yet. But you must be the happiest creature in the world these days. After all, you have brought the entire mankind who considered themselves the most superior to all other beings, to their knees. Proud for our superior intellect, ingenuity and technological development over past so many centuries, nearly the entire world except emergency service providers has been locked at home now. We constructed large and beautiful bridges, built monumental towers, statues and sacred places for worship which people visited for centuries. All those places are deserted now.We made airplanes and travelled in each corner of the world. We developed astronomical science, built rockets and travelled in space; we even set our footprint on the moon. But now we are afraid of even stepping outside our homes and you deserve the entire (dis)credit for this. Who are you in reality, Corona… are you a message from the nature that we’ve been ignoring for several decades or maybe, centuries? Are you a blow to us from the nature against whom we tried to prove ourselves superior? We were told time and again that we are part of the entire universal ecosystem and whatever development we make; it should be harmonious with this ecosystem so that life on the planet remains unaffected. We did not listen to this advice and you are probably the result of our misdeeds.Each phase of life, however pleasant or difficult, must pass and a new dawn must arrive. I sincerely hope that after causing so much harm to the mankind, you will go away by doing some good to us and make a few positive changes in our lives. Though you have built walls between us and our loved ones by isolating us, I hope that you will destroy walls of castes, religions and languages eventually as people will now realize that worth of a human life is much more than these manmade things. Capitalists are the ones who contribute immensely to our economic growth and provide millions of jobs. But they, at times, become so much profit hungry that they flout environmental norms and foster corruption to satisfy their profit motive. I hope that they will now realize that humanity is above everything and set their priorities accordingly. I hope that countries in the world will come closer in solidarity in the present situation and feuding nations will look for peaceful solutions to disputes between them rather than speaking the language of revenge and destruction. I hope that people in our country will become more hygiene conscious – not just on a personal level, but also in public places such that they maintain cleanliness everywhere. I also hope that our people will grow up with this experience and set their priorities to buy products with good quality rather than just buying cheap products, though this is not directly related to being infected by you. I expect them to value worth of manual labor and treat manual workers respectfully, ensuring their safety. This is crucial because when we interact with these workers, we are sure that we are dealing with hygienic people.Over the years, as medical science developed, our life span increased, and we started taking things for granted. Our approach to life became very rigid and unilateral. We didn’t care if life had something to talk to us…it did have a lot to tell us which is appearing now in your form and shape. It has been our belief for many centuries that we are fully evolved beings. You proved us wrong a hard way and made realize that we are still evolving, and the process of evolution is never complete for which, I thank you. We humans are innovative and intelligent. I’m sure, a vaccine on your infection will be shortly developed and your fear will be wiped out. But as you go, I only hope that you will teach us some good lessons of life that will prevent your younger siblings from entering our lives in years to come.

                                            <h2 class="ez-toc-section" id="a-rainbow-is-a-multicolored-arc-made-by-light-striking-water-droplets-the-most-familiar-type-of-rainbow-is-produced-whensunlight-strikes-raindrops-in-front-of-a-viewer-at-a-precise-angle-42-degrees">
                            7. A rainbow is a multicolored arc made by light striking water droplets. The most familiar type of rainbow is produced whensunlight strikes raindrops in front of a viewer at a precise angle (42 degrees). Rainbows can also be viewed around fog, sea spray,or waterfalls. A rainbow is an optical illusion—it does not actually exist in a specific spot in the sky. The appearance of a rainbowdepends on where you're standing and where the sun (or other source of light) is shining. The sun or other source of light is usuallybehind the person seeing the rainbow. In fact, the center of a primary rainbow is the antisolar point, the imaginary point exactlyopposite the sun.Rainbows are the result of the refraction and reflection of light. Both refraction and reflection are phenomena that involve achange in a wave's direction. A refracted wave may appear "bent", while a reflected wave might seem to "bounce back" from asurface or other wavefront.Light entering a water droplet is refracted. It is then reflected by the back of the droplet. As this reflectedlight leaves the droplet, it is refracted again, at multiple angles.The radius of a rainbow is determined by the water droplets' refractive index. A refractive index is the measure of how much aray of light refracts (bends) as it passes from one medium to another—from air to water, for example. A droplet with a high refractiveindex will help produce a rainbow with a smaller radius. Saltwater has a higher refractive index than freshwater, for instance, sorainbows formed by sea spray will be smaller than rainbows formed by rain.Rainbows are actually full circles. The antisolar point isthe center of the circle. Viewers in aircraft can sometimes see these circular rainbows.Viewers on the ground can only see the light reflected by raindrops above the horizon. Because each person's horizon is a littledifferent, no one actually sees a full rainbow from the ground. In fact, no one sees the same rainbow—each person has a differentantisolar point, each person has a different horizon. Someone who appears below or near the "end" of a rainbow to one viewer willsee another rainbow, extending from his or her own horizon.Guide Question1.Visible light waves are the only magnetic waves we can see. We can see these waves as the color of rainbows. Each color has adifferent wavelength \. Now, Which color of lights has the longest wavelength, has a shortest wavelength?2. In the picture, identify something that resembles a polygon? Determine whether it is convex or not.Ples po ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Violet has the shortest wavelength while red has the shortest wavelength </p><p>2. A raindrop is similar to a prism. It is convex. </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>1. As the full spectrum of visible light travels through a prism, the wavelengths separate into the colors of the rainbow because each color is a different wavelength. Violet has the shortest wavelength, at around 380 nanometers, and red has the longest wavelength, at around 700 nanometers. </p><p>2. Raindrops behave like small prisms, so they bend the different colors of the sunlight and disperse them out into a band of colors that appears as a rainbow. Water is denser than the surrounding air, and when the light moves out of raindrops, it moves into separate wavelengths. </p><br />

                            8. Instruction: Congratulations for making it this far! You’re almost done. Before you proceed to your next lesson, let us test your mastery. Today’s task is to read the following paragraphs and determine which pattern of development in writing is used. Are you ready? Here are the paragraphs. 1. Caring for yourself during these times is also caring for others. When we are allowed to go outside our houses, we should obey health practices. Some are skeptic about wearing masks. Others are still in doubt when asked to wash hands often or use alcohol and sanitizer. There are also people who question the need to maintain distance from each other in public areas. These safety measures are set because they are proven to be helpful in preventing the spread of the virus. They are not mere wishes to make our lives difficult. We are asked to do these health protocols because we are still in danger with the rising number of COVID-19 cases. Be responsible for yourself so that you will not be the reason for others to catch the virus. If you care for your loved ones, you must take care of yourself first. You do not want to be the one bringing the virus to your home. 2. The word quarantine is such a familiar one to almost everyone who are aware of the pandemic today. According to the Merriam- Webster dictionary online, it is a noun that has several meanings. It states that it is a period of 40 days. It may also be a term during which a ship arriving in port and suspected of carrying contagious disease is held in isolation from the shore. Also, it means a restraint upon the activities or communication of persons or the transport of goods designed to prevent the spread of disease or pests. It is also defined as a state of enforced isolation. For us, who have been in community quarantine for more or less three months, we know that quarantine means staying at home and waiting for the situation to be better. It is a condition wherein only those who have quarantine pass are allowed to go out for essential needs of the family. For others, the concept quarantine may also be equated to “no work, no pay” policy. Some may define it as something needed for people who are sick or those who came from places with COVID-19 cases. On the other hand, some probably sees quarantine as something that takes away their right to see family, relatives and friends. To sum it up, whatever or however we understand quarantine, we need to follow it as a safety protocol since we are still fighting this pandemic. 3. There are several similarities and differences between being a senior and junior high school student. Being a senior and junior high school student, both require you to study hard to be able to get desirable outputs and decent grades. Subjects are equally important to be given attention. It’s just that some subject areas may be easier to deal with depending on different factors. The subjects in senior high school (SHS) and junior high school (JHS) differ in a way that SHS subjects are more specific areas that are deemed essential for the track and strand you chose while in JHS, subjects are the general ones that we have since first grade, just increasing in complexity. Another similarity is that when you enter SHS and JHS, you have to prepare yourself to be a responsible part of the institution that you will enroll in. You should be ready to follow the policy that the school implements. Being a “senior” high student doesn’t mean you are superior or anything and being a “junior” high student doesn’t mean that you are under those in the SHS. The difference comes when there may be slight changes in the way rules and regulations are applied and the gravity of reprimands you may receive as you step up to higher grade levels or as you encounter different situations. In general, whether there are similarity or difference in being a Senior or Junior high school student, it’s is still up to you how you will handle it.​</h2><br />

                            12. Story:Death of a Salesman (Summary) A stage play written by Arthur Miller Willy Loman returns home exhausted after a business trip he has cancelled. Worried over Willy's state of mind and recent car accident, his wife Linda suggests that he ask his boss Howard Wagner to allow him to work in his home city so he will not have to travel. Willy complains to Linda that their son, Biff, has yet to do something with his life. Despite Biff's potential as a football star in high school, he failed in mathematics and was therefore unable to enter a university. Biff and his younger brother, Happy, who is temporarily staying with Willy and Linda after Biff's unexpected return from the West, reminisce about their childhood together. They discuss their father's mental degeneration, which they have witnessed in the form of his constant indecisiveness and daydreaming about the boys' high school years. Eventually, Willy walks in, angry that the two boys have never amounted to anything. In an effort to pacify their father, Biff and Happy tell him that Biff plans to make a business proposition the next day. The next day, Willy goes to ask Howard for a job in town while Biff goes to make a business proposition, but they both fail; Willy gets angry and ends up getting fired when Howard tells him he needs a rest and can no longer represent the company, while Biff waits hours to see a former employer who does not remember him and turns him down. Biff impulsively steals a fountain pen. Willy then goes to the office of his neighbor Charley, where he runs into Charley's son Bernard, now a successful lawyer. Bernard tells him that Biff originally wanted to go to summer school to make up for failing math, but something happened in Boston when Biff went to visit his father that changed his mind. Charley gives the now-unemployed Willy money to pay his life-insurance premium, and Willy shocks Charley by remarking that ultimately, a man is "worth more dead than alive." Happy, Biff, and Willy meet for dinner at a restaurant, but Willy refuses to hear bad news from Biff. Happy tries to get Biff to lie to their father. Biff tries to tell him what happened as Willy gets angry and slips into a flashback of what happened in Boston the day Biff came to see him: Willy had been in Boston for work, and Biff went to visit him to ask Willy to convince his teacher to curve Biff's failing math grade. Willy was in the middle of an affair with a receptionist, when Biff arrived unexpectedly at the hotel room, and saw the woman, who was half-dressed. Willy attempted to explain away her presence as an innocent borrowing of his shower, while her own room was undergoing renovations, but Biff is unconvinced and angrily dismisses Willie as a liar and a fake before storming out. From that moment, Biff's views of his father changed and set him adrift. Biff leaves the restaurant in frustration, followed by Happy and two girls that Happy picked up, leaving a confused and upset Willy behind. When they later return home, Linda angrily confronts them for abandoning their father while Willy remains outside, talking to himself. Biff tries to reconcile with Willy, but the discussion quickly escalates into another argument. Biff conveys plainly to his father that he is not meant for anything great, insisting that both of them are simply ordinary men meant to lead ordinary lives. The argument reaches an apparent climax as Biff hugs Willy and begins to cry as he tries to get Willy to let go of his unrealistic expectations. Rather than listen to what Biff actually says, Willy appears to believe his son has forgiven him and will follow in his footsteps, and after Linda goes upstairs to bed, lapses one final time into a hallucination, thinking he is talking to his long-dead brother Ben. In Willy's mind, Ben approves of the scheme Willy has dreamed up to kill himself in order to give Biff his insurance policy money. Willy exits the house, and Biff and Linda cry out in despair as the sound of Willy's car blares up and fades out. The final scene takes place at Willy's funeral, which is attended only by his family, Charley and Bernard. The ambiguities of mixed and unaddressed emotions persist, particularly over whether Willy's choices or circumstances were obsolete. At the funeral, Biff retains his belief that he does not want to become a businessman like his father. Happy, on the other hand, chooses to follow in his father's footsteps, while Linda laments her husband's decision just before her final payment on the house. QUESTION:1.

                            15. Once upon a time, in a far-off land, there was a powerful wizard named Alaric who was known for his incredible magic skills. He lived alone in a tall tower, hidden deep within the enchanted forest, and very few people had ever seen him.One day, a young girl named Lily stumbled upon Alaric's tower while exploring the forest. She was amazed by its beauty and decided to enter. As soon as she stepped inside, Alaric appeared before her.Lily was frightened at first, but Alaric was friendly and welcomed her inside. He was impressed by her courage and decided to teach her some magic tricks.As time went by, Lily learned more and more from Alaric, and they became close friends. She discovered that Alaric was actually a kind-hearted wizard who had been hiding from the world because he feared his power could be used for evil.One day, an evil sorcerer named Malakar arrived in the enchanted forest, and he was determined to destroy everything in his path. He had an army of dark creatures that obeyed his every command, and they began to terrorize the forest.Alaric and Lily knew they had to do something to stop Malakar, so they set out to gather the bravest warriors and wizards from all across the land. They formed a powerful army and marched into battle against Malakar and his minions.The battle was long and grueling, and it seemed like all hope was lost. But just when things were looking their bleakest, Lily remembered a spell that Alaric had taught her, and she used it to create a giant shield that protected the army from Malakar's attacks.With the shield in place, the army was able to regroup and launch a final attack against Malakar. Alaric used his most powerful magic to defeat the evil sorcerer, and the dark creatures disappeared back into the shadows.After the battle, Lily and Alaric were hailed as heroes, and they continued to teach magic to those who wished to learn. They became known as the protectors of the enchanted forest, and their legend lived on for generations to come.Question:1. What is the name of the wizard in the story?2. Where does Alaric live?3.

He had grown old and could not run fast anymore. As days went by it became more and more difficult for him to hunt.One day while he was wandering through the forest in search of food, he came across a cave. He peeped in and smelt the air inside the cave. “Some animal must be staying here," he said to himself. He crept inside the cave only to find it empty. “I will hide inside and wait for the animal to return," he thought.The cave was the home of a jackal. Everyday, the jackal would go out in search of food and return to the cave in the evening to rest. That evening, the jackal after having his meal started towards home. But as he came closer, he felt something wrong. Everything around him very quiet. “Something is wrong," the jackal said to himself. “Why are all the birds and insects so silent?"Very slowly and cautiously, he walked towards his cave. He looked around him, watching for any signs of danger. As he got closer to the mouth of the cave, all his instincts alerted him of danger. “I have to make sure that everything is alright," thought the jackal. Suddenly, he thought of a plan.The clever jackal called out to the cave. “Hello my good cave, what happened to you today? Why are you so quiet?"The jackal’s voice echoed deep inside the cave. The lion, who by now could control his hunger no longer, thought to himself, “I think it is because I am here that the cave is silent. Before the jackal realises that something is wrong, I should do something."The jackal continued to call out, “Have you forgotten our agreement cave? You are supposed to greet me when I return home." The lion tried to make his voice sound hollow and called out from within the cave, “Welcome home my friend."The birds chirped loudly and flew away on hearing the lion’s roar. As for the jackal, he shook with fear. Before the hungry lion could pounce on him and eat him up, the jackal ran for his dear life as fast as his legs could carry him.The lion waited for a long while for the jackal to enter the cave. But when the jackal did not come in, the lion realised that he had been fooled. He cursed himself for his foolishness that made him lose a prey.​</h2><br />

                            20. Accomplish the plot diagram following the 5 elements of the story plot from The Pardoner’s Tale. Write your answer on the box provided.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The Pardoner’s Taleby: Geoffrey ChaucerThe Pardoner describes a group of young Flemish people who spend their time drinking and reveling, indulging in all forms of excess. After commenting on their lifestyle of debauchery, the Pardoner enters into a tirade against the vices that they practice. First and foremost is gluttony, which he identifies as the sin that first caused the fall of mankind in Eden. Next, he attacks drunkenness, which makes a man seem mad and witless. Next is gambling, the temptation that ruins men of power and wealth. Finally, he denounces swearing. He argues that it so offends God that he forbade swearing in the Second Commandment—placing it higher up on the list than homicide. After almost two hundred lines of sermonizing, the Pardoner finally returns to his story of the lecherous Flemish youngsters.	As three of these rioters sit drinking, they hear a funeral knell. One of the reveler’s servants tells the group that an old friend of theirs was slain that very night by a mysterious figure named Death. The rioters are outraged and, in their drunkenness, decide to find and kill Death to avenge their friend. Traveling down the road, they meet an old man who appears sorrowful. He says his sorrow stems from old age—he has been waiting for Death to come and take him for some time, and he has wandered all over the world. The youths, hearing the name of Death, demand to know where they can find him. The old man directs them into a grove, where he says he just left Death under an oak tree. The rioters rush to the tree, underneath which they find not Death but eight bushels of gold coins with no owner in sight.	At first, they are speechless, but, then, the youngest of the three reminds them that if they carry the gold into town in daylight, they will be taken for thieves. They must transport the gold under cover of night, and so someone must run into town to fetch bread and wine in the meantime. They draw lots, and the youngest of the three loses and runs off toward town. As soon as he is gone, the sly plotter turns to his friend and divulges his plan: when their friend returns from town, they will kill him and therefore receive greater shares of the wealth. The second rioter agrees, and they prepare their trap. Back in town, the youngest vagrant is having similar thoughts. He could easily be the richest man in town, he realizes, if he could have all the gold to himself. He goes to the apothecary and buys the strongest poison available, then puts the poison into two bottles of wine, leaving a third bottle pure for himself. He returns to the tree, but the other two rioters leap out and kill him.	They sit down to drink their friend’s wine and celebrate, but each happens to pick up a poisoned bottle. Within minutes, they lie dead next to their friend. Thus, concludes the Pardoner, all must beware the sin of avarice, which can only bring treachery and death. He realizes that he has forgotten something: he has relics and pardons in his bag. According to his custom, he tells the pilgrims the value of his relics and asks for contributions—even though he has just told them the relics are fake. He offers the Host the first chance to come forth and kiss the relics, since the Host is clearly the most enveloped in sin. The Host is outraged and proposes to make a relic out of the Pardoner’s genitals, but the Knight calms everybody down. The Host and Pardoner kiss and make up, and all have a good laugh as they continue on their way.​</h2><br />

After Pearl Harbor, the Philippines was invaded by Japan. I had never been a soldier. I was a journalist. But something impelled me to enlist. I was attached to General MacArthur’s staff and went with him first to Bataan and later to Corregidor. In Corregidor, I was placed in charge of the broadcast called Voice of Freedom. The Japanese reacted violently to the broadcast. I learned that a prize had been put on my head, and worse that they had gone after my wife and four sons who had been left behind in the occupied territory. I suffered indescribable torment, worrying about my loved ones. I wanted to go back to Manila at whatever cost. But I was order to proceed to Australia on the eve of the fall of Bataan. From Australia, I was sent on to the United States, where I continued to make the Voice of Freedom heard, regardless of the consequenSeeeneral MacArthur, aided by Filipino guerillas who had carried on a vigorous resistance during the more than three years of enemy occupation. The second I was called upon to make considerable sacrifice for my convictions was during 1953 national elections in the Philippines. I had never been a politician, but having become convince that I should do everything I could to help effect a change of government in my country, I resigned as Ambassador to the United States and permanent representative to the United Nations in order to enter the field against the incumbent president— started a vigorous campaign to awaken the Filipino people to the need for a change in administration. Midway in the campaign, it became apparent that the two opposition parties might lose the election if they remained divided, but had an excellent chance to win if they present a united front. I made the painful decision to withdraw my candidacy. After withdrawing my own candidacy, I was the campaign manager of Mr. Ramon Magsaysay and campaigned up and down the land for him. i could not have worked harder if I had been the candidate myself. Magsaysay won by a landslide. The temptation was strong for all those who had worked for him to share in the rewards of victory. I was convinced, however, that the first duty of everyone who had helped to bring about a change of government was to give the new president a completely free hand in making appointments to keep positions in his administration. Immediately after the elections, I left for the United States.​</h2><br />

                            22. Summarize the Story in 5-10 sentencesTHE HEROISM OF BERNARDO CARPIOOnce upon a time, there was a couple who lived in one of the many mountains of San Mateo, Rizal. The man and the woman were very poor and led a very hard life. But one day, amidst all their poverty and hardships, came a bundle of joy and happiness. The man and the woman were given the gift of the birth of a big, beautiful, and healthy baby boy. They named their newborn son Bernardo Carpio and he became his parents’ most precious treasure.Like any other kid, Bernardo loved to play. But something was noticeably very different about Bernardo. Unlike the other kids, Bernardo had the power of extraordinary strength.It was said that when Bernardo was still a baby crawling on all fours, all the floorboard nails that he hooked with his tiny fingernails were pulled out from their very places. When Bernardo was still learning how to walk, any railing that he used for support was destroyed and splintered into pieces. And anytime Bernardo’s parents gave him a new toy to play with, the toy would break and become crushed in the palms of his small hands.As Bernardo grew up to be a handsome young man, his power doubled and increased even more. He soon became renowned not only for his power of extraordinary strength, but also for his dashing good looks. Furthermore, Bernardo possessed great courage and bravery that were second to none. Everyone knew that Bernardo could easily beat any man so no one would dare face Bernardo Carpio in a match of strength and bravery.Not like other typical guys, Bernardo was not interested in merriment, social gatherings, and other festivities. The loveliness of all the beautiful young women in his town did not appeal to him. What really captivated Bernardo was the forest.Bernardo found his real happiness in the forest. The part where the trees were the thickest and the densest is where he often stayed. There is where he spent time with and sought the company of his close friends, the animals of the forest.In the forest that Bernardo frequented lived an enchanted creature. This enchanted creature was a very big and a very strong male. However, the creature also had the ugly manner of envying and causing harm to others. The enchanted creature had seen Bernardo many times during the innumerable visits that he had made to the forest.It did not take long before the begrudging and hateful enchanted creature got wind of Bernardo’s fame for his extraordinary strength. The enchanted creature was sure that the young man would be no match against his own power and strength. One day, the enchanted creature waited for Bernardo to come into the forest. As soon as he saw Bernardo, he immediately challenged him to a duel. Bernardo was not one to back down from any fight so he accepted the challenge right away.And so the two fought. This was followed by many different battles in which both of them made use of their power of great strength. And in every single one of them, the enchanted creature lost.They separated after a long and arduous battle. The enchanted creature left but not without hatred in his heart for the one that defeated him. He waited for the right time and the right opportunity to exact revenge on Bernardo for the loss and shame that he had suffered in his hands.When the enchanted creature was able to chance upon Bernardo once again, he invited him to a hidden area of the forest. In that area were two enormous slabs of stone that were positioned on either side of the place. In the middle of those two stone slabs was where the enchanted creature dwelled. The creature told Bernardo to go ahead and enter the place. As soon as Bernardo reached the spot right in the center of the two stones, the enchanted creature vanished into thin air. And suddenly, the two stone slabs started to fall towards Bernardo. Using his extraordinary strength, Bernardo fought against the stones’ massive weight and size to prevent them from crushing him.According to the elders, Bernardo Carpio is still in the same place, holding those two stones. And every time an earthquake occurs, it is said that it is because of Bernardo Carpio moving and wishing to break free.I'm very sorry that this is Long</h2><br />

                            25. Read the selection below. Then answer the questions correctly. It is bad to have food stuck between your teeth for long periods of time. This is because food attracts germs, germs produce acid, and acid hurts your teeth and gums. Flossing helps to remove the food that gets stuck between your teeth. This explains why flossing helps to keep your mouth healthy, but some doctors say that flossing can be also good for your heart. It may seem strange that something you do for your teeth can have any effect on your heart. Doctors have come up with a few ideas about how flossing works to keep your heart healthy. One idea is that the germs that hurt your teeth can leave the mouth and travel into your blood. Germs that get into the blood can then attack your heart. Another idea is because when there are too many germs in your mouth, the body tries to fight against these germs. For some reason, the way the body fights these mouth germs may end up weakening the heart over time. Not every doctor agrees about these ideas. Some doctors think that the link between good flossing habits and good heart health is only a coincidence. A coincidence is the occurrence of two or more events at one time apparently by mere chance. The incidence of these events is completely random, as they do not admit of any reliable cause and effect relationship between them. For example, every time I wash my car, it rains. This does not mean that when I wash my car, I somehow change the weather. This is only a coincidence. Likewise, some doctors think that people who have bad flossing habits just happen to also have heart problems, and people who have good flossing habits just happen to have healthy hearts. The theory that flossing your teeth helps to keep your heart healthy might not be true. But every doctor agrees that flossing is a great way to keep your teeth healthy. So even if flossing does not help your heart, it is sure to help your teeth. This is enough of a reason for everyone to floss their teeth every day.41. Which of the following is the most appropriate title for this passage? A. Why Doctors Disagree about Flossing B. How to Keep Your Teeth Healthy C. Flossing Your Way to a Healthy Heart D. Flossing by Coincidence 42. How flossing effectively keeps your mouth healthy?

                            27. A hotel has and had a series of walk-outs, which have become the main topic of conversation at departmental management meetings. The most recent has been investigated fairly thoroughly, and the following facts have emerged. The clients (a couple and three children) checked out in one evening at around 9:30pm. They were chance bookings, but the receptionist took a deposit for the first night’s accommodation and tax. When the morning shift arrived they enter the booking onto the computer, since it had not been done the night before. At 5:00am the housekeeper reported that they had not vacated the room, so a message was left on the system for them to call reception. The hotel was not full, so it was not really a problem. When the family arrived backed in, they called reception, and said they wanted to stay until the weekend, so their stay was extended, and all the departments were advised of the departure date. The hall porter reported that they had been very friendly, had been on several trips, and always appeared very pleasant. The restaurant staff said they always added a tip when they signed the bill, and most staff were eager were eager to serve them. The housekeeper said the room was usually quite tidy, although they had very little luggage for a relatively large family, who were staying (she was told) until the end of the month. In public relations they were anxious to please this family, since he worked for a well-known company, whose business would be a great asset to the hotel if they could get this client to recommend them. The bar manager reported that, ‘The gentleman liked a drink, but never brought the children down. He usually sent them and his wife something upstairs and put it on the bill.’ By the time the family walked out they had accumulated a large bill and several different stories had grown up around them. Tasks (20 pts.) 1.1 List the departments that were at fault in this scenario. 1.2 Write a report for the general manager explaining how this could have happened. 1.3 List the departments that were not involved but should have been. 1.4 Outline ways in which this situation could be avoided again. ​</h2><br />
