                        <p>The question lacks certain information that would help us to
answer the question accurately. However, heat conductor is needed to transfer
heat from one matter to another. In particular, the transfer of heat may occur
in several ways and is classified into the following mechanisms of thermal
transfer: conduction, convection, radiation.</p><br />

                            2. What is needed to transfer heat in this device</h2><br />
                        There are three means by which heat can be transferred. These are conduction in solids, convection in liquids and gases, and radiation in anything that allows electromagnetic waves to pass through it. Conduction and convection involves particles while radiation only involves electromagnetic waves.<br /><br />Conduction transfers heat through direct contact. That is, heat is transferred from the hotter object to the colder one. Conductors, such as metals, allows heat to transfer easily while insulators, such as fiberglass and wood, do not.<br /><br />Convection, on the other hand, refers to the heat transfer from one place to another through the movement of fluids which involves mass transfer. Like conduction, convection also involves heat transfer from the hotter fluid to the cooler one. For example, when water is heated, a part of it absorbs enough thermal energy and transforms to gaseous phase, which is less dense but has greater energy.<br /><br />Lastly, radiation involves heat transfer without physical contact or simply put, it does not involve interaction of matter. Radiation can occur even in vacuum. Thermal energy is carried by electromagnetic waves from the origin and spreads out. All objects radiate energy. The hotter the object the more it radiates off. Dull or rough surfaces reflect radiation poorly but absorbs radiation easily. Shiny surfaces in contrast reflects radiation easily but poorly absorbs radiation. <br />

Any energy unit can be used for heat transfer, and the most common are kilocalorie (kcal) and joule (J). Kilocalorie is defined to be the energy needed to change the temperature of 1.00 kg of water between 14.5ºC and 15.5ºC.</p><p></p><p>12.)In thermodynamics and engineering, a heat engine is a system that converts heat to mechanical energy, which can then be used to do mechanical work. It does this by bringing a working substance from a higher state temperature to a lower state temperature.</p><p></p><p>13.)A heat engine is considered to be 100% efficient if only all the heat is converted into useful work or mechanical energy. Since heat engines cannot convert all the heat energy into mechanical energy, their efficiency can never be 100%.</p><p></p><p>14.)Simply put, thermal pollution comes from hot water or cold water being dumped into a body of water. Bodies of water naturally tend to dissipate the heat gained from warm currents, underwater hot springs, and from the sun.</p><p></p><p>15.)The air then flows over a heating element (similar to the one in a fan heater). On a cold day, this part of the unit may be turned right up so the HVAC works as a heater. ... As it does so, it picks up heat from the air blowing past the pipes and evaporates, turning from a cool liquid into a hotter gas.</p><p></p><p>16.)Heat Engines are any device that converts thermal energy into mechanical energy/work. Chemical energy in fuel transformed into thermal energy then some of the thermal energy transformed into mechanical energy. This process explains how an internal combustion engine works.</p><p></p><p>17.)According to the second law of thermodynamics, however, it cannot convert *all* of the heat energy supplied to it into work. Basic heat engine: hot reservoir, cold reservoir, and a machine to convert heat energy into work. This is a simplified diagram of a heat engine, along with its thermal cycle.</p><p></p><p>18.) (the end of the compression stroke) the compressed air-fuel mixture is ignited by a spark plug (in a gasoline engine) or by heat generated by high compression (diesel engines), forcefully returning the piston to B.D.C. This stroke produces mechanical work from the engine to turn the crankshaft.</p><p></p><p>19.)The great advantage of using a heat pump to keep your home warm, rather than just burning fuel, is that a heat pump supplies Qh = Qc + W. Heat transfer is from the outside air, even at a temperature below freezing, to the indoor space. You only pay for W, and you get an additional heat transfer of Qc from the outside at no cost; in many cases, at least twice as much energy is transferred to the heated space as is used to run the heat pump. When you burn fuel to keep warm, you pay for all of it. The disadvantage is that the work input (required by the second law of thermodynamics) is sometimes more expensive than simply burning fuel, especially if the work is done by electrical energy.</p><p></p><p>20.)The statement that thermal pollution is brought about by the accumulated exhaustion of heat from diesel, gasoline and industrial engines is indeed correct. ...

                        <p><strong>~</strong><strong>The air conditioner pulls heat out of the air in your home, cools it over a set of cold pipes (an evaporator coil), and releases the cool air into your home. The evaporator coil remains cold thanks to a liquid refrigerant that absorbs hot air and changes it to </strong><strong>gas</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>~</strong><strong>There are three means by which heat can be transferred. These are conduction in solids, convection in liquids and gases, and radiation in anything that allows electromagnetic waves to pass through it. ... Radiation can occur even in vacuum. Thermal energy is carried by electromagnetic waves from the origin and spreads out.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>~</strong><strong>So how does a typical air conditioning unit work and keep you sane during the heat of summer? The basic concept is that a chemical called a refrigerant loops from inside the home to outside and back again, absorbing and casting out heat in the </strong><strong>process</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>~</strong><strong>During the cold days, the air conditioner is used to make the air warm in an immediate area. The device provides warmer air in the same way it produces cooler air during hot days</strong></p><br />
