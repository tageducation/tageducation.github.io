                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>Question</strong><strong>:</strong><strong> </strong><strong>do you think do you think professional athletes earn too much money? why or why not? which part at least do you think earn the money?</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Answers</strong><strong>:</strong></p><p></p><p>In my mind, <strong>absolutely</strong> <strong>not</strong>. Professional athletes are making too much money in a society where salaries and wages are traditionally based on the value of one's work. In fact, each basket Kobe Bryant scores earns him equivalent to the average classroom teacher's yearly salary.</p><p></p><p>When <strong>fans</strong> look at professional athletes' salaries, it's easy to say they make far too much money for playing a game. And the few athletes who get that far have relatively short careers—just 5 to 10 years to earn a living, compared with 40 or 50 years for other jobs.</p><p></p><p>#READYTOHELP </p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>i think it would cause a messy one because on a game or sport it must have to had a management to maintain the right rules.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>not sure if the answer is correct</p>Then there will be no rule enforcement if there was no official. This implies no game, both philosophically and literally, according to formalism. After all course, referees may overlook instances of rule violations. <strong>Why</strong><strong> </strong><strong>do</strong><strong> </strong><strong>we</strong><strong> </strong><strong>require</strong> <strong>officials</strong><strong>?</strong><strong> </strong>An official ensures that such athletes and participants follow the rules and perform in good sportsmanship. They are also able to guarantee that everyone observes and enjoys the game/event.#Carryonlearning <p></p><br />

                            27. What do you think about having a business or being an entrepreneur? Do you think it’s hard? Why or why not?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>I believe that being an entrpreneur is hard. When you start a business or when you're planning to start a business there's always doubt on the back of your head which could be mentally draining. If you get pass that phase then ther would be a lot of paper works to do since you have to get a lot of permit for your business to be legal. Even after your business has already succeeded you mught still encounter problems in the future</p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>In many ways the current beliefs and thinking around entrepreneurship seem amazing compared to previous generations. It's no longer uncommon for someone to walk away from employment opportunities, no matter how great, in order to start their own business.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Although they may be confident in their decision to forge his or her own, uncharted path to successful business ownership, prosperity is not guaranteed. The risks, roadblocks, and psychological challenges involved are enough to deter even the most confident entrepreneur with the best product offering.

He's the CEO of PHP Agency, a financial services company with over 3,000 agents across the country. He's also the creator of Valuetainment, a Youtube channel with nearly 400,000 subscribers and millions of views. He is, in my view, one of the biggest advocates of capitalism and entrepreneurship in the world. </strong></p><p><strong>More to learn: "When you read the definition of entrepreneurship, you find lots of references for taking risk, risk of loss, greater than normal risk, and so on. I fundamentally disagree. Being an entrepreneur reduces risk. You are not employed or paid at the whim of a boss. You control your destiny, your upside, your opportunities, your time and your career."

                            29. Why do you think we shouldn't bully someone? Is it not necessary? Why do you think so. ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Why do you think we shouldn't bully someone? Is it not necessary? Why do you think so. </strong></p><p></p><p>✔︎Kids bully for many reasons. Some bully because they feel insecure. Picking on someone who seems emotionally or physically weaker provides a feeling of being more important, popular, or in control. In other cases, kids bully because they simply don't know that it's not OK to pick on kids who are different because of size, looks, race, or religion.Some kids who bully are copying behavior that they see at home. Kids who see aggressive and unkind interactions in the family often learn to treat others the same way. And kids who are taunted learn that bullying can translate into control over children they see as weak.</p><p></p><p>It extremely necessary for us to NOT bully someone because we never knew what will be the consequences are. We should stop  bullying because it causes huge impacts like anxiety , depression, loneliness, eating disorders, low self-esteem, or even suicide . Bullying never solves anything and happens frequently which is wrong. People die or don't go to school because of bullying. Bullying is one of the reasons why people have social anxiety or just hate school honestly.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>sana maktulong yarns.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>An analogy is a comparison between two objects, or systems of objects, that highlights respects in which they are thought to be similar. Analogical reasoning is any type of thinking that relies upon an analogy. An analogical argument is an explicit representation of a form of analogical reasoning that cites accepted similarities between two systems to support the conclusion that some further similarity exists. In general (but not always), such arguments belong in the category of ampliative reasoning, since their conclusions do not follow with certainty but are only supported with varying degrees of strength. However, the proper characterization of analogical arguments is subject to debate (see §2.2).</p><p></p><p>Analogical reasoning is fundamental to human thought and, arguably, to some nonhuman animals as well. Historically, analogical reasoning has played an important, but sometimes mysterious, role in a wide range of problem-solving contexts. The explicit use of analogical arguments, since antiquity, has been a distinctive feature of scientific, philosophical and legal reasoning. This article focuses primarily on the nature, evaluation and justification of analogical arguments. Related topics include metaphor, models in science, and precedent and analogy in legal reasoning.</p><p></p><p>1. Introduction: the many roles of analogy</p><p>2.
