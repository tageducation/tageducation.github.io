                                            TEST
Directions: Read each paragraph carefully. Encircle the cue words used. On the blank, write the text
structure.
1. There are many likenesses between my two brothers. Glenn is my eldest brother
whereas Eric is younger than me. Just like Glenn, Eric also attended the same
college. However, they belong to different departments. Glen studied engineering
while Eric studied nursing. Now, Glenn and Eric are both married to their high school
sweethearts.
2. Drug abuse causes multiple problems for countries and communities. The medical
and psychological effects are very obvious. Due to drugs, addicts cannot function as
normal members of society. They neglect or abuse their families. Consequently, they
eventually require expensive treatment or hospitalization
3. School has increased in its difficulty over the years. Initially, in kindergarten was all i
had to do was finger paint, crafts, and daily naptimes. Then during my elementary
years, math went from adding and subtracting to multiplication and division. After that
came junior high with its more advanced math, which also strengthened my
independent study skills. Recently high school has been the most difficult - my
responsibilities have gone from naptime to chemistry equations.
4. Goldfish make the best imaginable pets. First of all, goldfish are extremely quiet.
They don't bark, meow, chirp, squawk, screech, or race around the house while you
and your neighbors are trying to sleep. Second, goldfish are very small and easy to
house. These diminutive animals don't usually grow much bigger than a few inches.
Third, they are very economical. They don't eat much and they don't need to be
groomed.
5. Coming to a new school is hard, so we should figure out how to make new students
feel welcome. New students have to fit in with new class in an unfamiliar place with
unfamiliar rules. This problem can make them feel lonely. In order to make them feel
comfortable, we can help them fit in. We can show them around the campus and sit
with them to eat during recess and lunch. We can also introduce ourselves and get
to know them.

Every newexperience was, at one time or another, the first experience. For good or bad, each instancechanged the course that my life has taken. But, the most transformative experience was the birthof my youngest brother.Joel is someone my parents often call a happy accident. At the time that my mother becamepregnant, I was 13, and my other brother, Jake, was 10. We were what you would call a well-rounded, perfect family of four. We neatly fit into the perfect classification in nearly every way.We didn't realize what we were missing until the moment that my youngest brother first openedhis striking blue eyes.In truth, I resented the fact that I would be having another sibling. Nothing needed to be addedto our family, and my mother, already 38 at the time, was considered high risk because of herage. The pregnancy itself was full of complications that sent the straight course of my life intorollercoaster-like loops that my 13-year-old mind had a hard time comprehending. But now, I cansee how forging through those loops helped me to roll with the punches that life inevitably brings​</a>

Carabaos and cows are important farm animals. [1] (Together with/Similar) other animals, they both help farmers in producing milk and other farm and dairy products. Meat, [2] (namely/for example), is one of the most important products that both of them can provide. [3] (Besides/Moreover), milk is also an essential item that carabaos and cows produce. [4] (In fact/Indeed), kesong puti is good for breakfast as spread or stuffing for varieties of bread [5] (that is/such as) pandesal and loaf bread. [6] (Therefore/Indeed), cows and carabaos can produce food items that we need in our daily lives.
Last year, we had to sell dozens of carabaos and cows for my parents to financially support me with my studies. [7] (As a result/Accordingly), my family recorded and generated small return of investment for that year. [8] (Instead/Although) we suffered a great loss, we still managed to survive with the help of my uncle.
Uncle Romeo has lent us his resources. [9] (On the other hand/Together with) this, he looked for possible investors who would finance our small farm business. [10] (Consequently/Meanwhile), a known dairy company, invested large amount of money to our small-scale farm. We accepted its offer. [11] (In fact/Wherefore), we have already started the expansion of our farm. From 20 remaining cows and carabaos, we now have at least hundreds of them. Our humble farm can now provide a large amount of milk products to our partner-company. [12] (For instance/Henceforth), we can at least supply them 500 liters of milk per day [13] (importantly/notwithstanding) the El Niño phenomenon that we are currently experiencing.
[14] (As a result/Similar) of this success, our family is planning to further expand our business venture, [15] (for example/to demonstrate), production of other farm products from hogs and chicken. [16] (Coupled with/Whereas) our dedication and enthusiasm, our partner-company has pledged to continuously support us in this endeavor. [17] (Comparatively/In fact), we are now working on our feasibility study about this concept. [18] (Consequently/Furthermore), other government policies and bank loans are considered for this project.
[19] (In conclusion/Otherwise), starting a business is not really an easy task, [20] (even more/indeed) a difficult one. [21] (Instead/While) others may not believe in your capacity, it is your duty to trust yourself and the process. With faith and confidence, you will surely achieve your dreams. From carabaos and cows, our small farm will soon be one of the famous haciendas in town producing and delivering quality products and goods.</a>

                            4. TEST
Directions: Read each paragraph carefully. Encircle the cue words used. On the blank, write the text
structure.
1. There are many likenesses between my two brothers. Glenn is my eldest brother
whereas Eric is younger than me. Just like Glenn, Eric also attended the same
college. However, they belong to different departments. Glen studied engineering
while Eric studied nursing. Now, Glenn and Eric are both married to their high school
sweethearts.
2. Drug abuse causes multiple problems for countries and communities. The medical
and psychological effects are very obvious. Due to drugs, addicts cannot function as
normal members of society. They neglect or abuse their families. Consequently, they
eventually require expensive treatment or hospitalization
3. School has increased in its difficulty over the years. Initially, in kindergarten was all i
had to do was finger paint, crafts, and daily naptimes. Then during my elementary
years, math went from adding and subtracting to multiplication and division. After that
came junior high with its more advanced math, which also strengthened my
independent study skills. Recently high school has been the most difficult - my
responsibilities have gone from naptime to chemistry equations.
4. Goldfish make the best imaginable pets. First of all, goldfish are extremely quiet.
They don't bark, meow, chirp, squawk, screech, or race around the house while you
and your neighbors are trying to sleep. Second, goldfish are very small and easy to
house. These diminutive animals don't usually grow much bigger than a few inches.
Third, they are very economical. They don't eat much and they don't need to be
groomed.
5. Coming to a new school is hard, so we should figure out how to make new students
feel welcome. New students have to fit in with new class in an unfamiliar place with
unfamiliar rules. This problem can make them feel lonely. In order to make them feel
comfortable, we can help them fit in. We can show them around the campus and sit
with them to eat during recess and lunch. We can also introduce ourselves and get
to know them.

Nothing needed to be addedto our family, and my mother, already 38 at the time, was considered high risk because of herage. The pregnancy itself was full of complications that sent the straight course of my life intorollercoaster-like loops that my 13-year-old mind had a hard time comprehending.

On Small-Scale Farming

Carabaos and cows are important farm animals. [1] (Together with/Similar) other animals, they both help farmers in producing milk and other farm and dairy products. Meat, [2] (namely/for example), is one of the most important products that both of them can provide. [3] (Besides/Moreover), milk is also an essential item that carabaos and cows produce. [4] (In fact/Indeed), kesong puti is good for breakfast as spread or stuffing for varieties of bread [5] (that is/such as) pandesal and loaf bread. [6] (Therefore/Indeed), cows and carabaos can produce food items that we need in our daily lives.
Last year, we had to sell dozens of carabaos and cows for my parents to financially support me with my studies. [7] (As a result/Accordingly), my family recorded and generated small return of investment for that year.
