                            1. What are the positive and negative impacts of the law?</h2><br />
                        POSITIVE TECHNOLOGICAL IMPACTS ON LAW ENFORCEMENT<br /><br />     New and emerging technologies are now playing an extremely crucial role in the day to day work of field agents, equipping them with specialized equipment and investigative tools that have the potential to make them better informed, more effective, and a lot safer. <br />     Law enforcement usage of computer technology has expanded tremendously over the past two decades. Given the increasing power and diminishing costs of technology, the extensive growth in mobile communications infrastructure, and the expansion of new applications available, computer usage continues to increase in law enforcement agencies throughout the United States. <br />     According to the 2007 LEMAS (Law Enforcement Management and Administrative Statistics) survey lately released by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, U.S. Department of Justice, and local police departments report using computers for a mixture of law enforcement functions, including records like 79 percent management, 60 percent crime investigation, 50 percent information sharing, and 49 percent dispatch. All larger police departments reported using computers for crime breakdown and crime mapping (100 percent). Agencies serving populations of 25,000 or more reported having access to Automated Fingerprint Identification Systems (AFIS) and using infield computers (for example, mobile digital computers, terminals, and laptops). In addition to the broad availability of infield computers, agents also had access to an expanding collection of information including 88 percent vehicle records, 81 percent driving records, 81 percent warrants, 66 percent protection orders, 60 percent inter-agency information sharing, 60 percent calls-for-service history, and 50 percent criminal history records. Police departments of all sizes were much more likely to use electronic ways to broadcast criminal incident reports to headquarters, with 60 percent of all agencies in 2007, compared to just 38 percent in 2003. Automating the transmission of incident reports is a critical element in building sensible, accurate information and information-sharing capabilities. <br />     In addition to infield computers, two-thirds of police departments throughout the nation reported regularly using video cameras, and well over half reported using video cameras in patrol cars. The deployment of in-car video cameras has increased substantially since the year 2000 in agencies of all sizes.<br /><br />NEGATIVE TECHNOLOGICAL IMPACTS ON LAW ENFORCEMENT<br /><br />     As we gain improvements in technology, we are facing negative effects. Every time a new product is developed people immediately discover excellent and clever ways to utilize it; therefore law enforcement officers have to be very cautious when they receive technological advances. Learning how to properly use modern, advanced tools is a very pertinent skill for the officers to have. When criminals gain possession of these inventions, conflict can arise, and caution must be taken by officers. All new advancements are crucial to the protection of agents and local citizens. Technology is growing and creating more relationships between law enforcement and the community. The explosive growth and technological complexity of smart phones, and the rising popularity of social networking sites have empowered the general public and raised expectations concerning services provided by law enforcement, the ability to communicate with police, and the clearness of the organization. Technology offers crucial benefits to our society, but can be used in negative ways as well. All officers should take caution when gaining possession of these new advancements, and utilize them to their full ability in the situation of protection.<br />

                            3. what are the positive and negative impacts of the law</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><strong>What are the positive and negative impacts of the law?</strong><p></p><p>Law is the standardized, agreed, and accepted rules circulating and implemented in a specific jurisdiction. It keeps members organized and protected from anyone who intends to do harm and maltreatment.</p><p></p><strong>The positive impacts of law are:</strong>It protects the citizens from maltreatment - law is intended to protect and maintain peace in a place. If someone plans to inflict harm and conflict, there will be a corresponding punishments in every harmful action they will commit. Also, different governments have their own different set of rules that may be contradicting to other nearby places so people should be mindful that they should observe, follow, and respect the existing laws implemented in that country. Living in peace is the end goal of law.It keeps our actions and processes in order - since everyone has their own means and methods of doing things, there will be instances that they might offend or hurt others that will result to quarrels and arguments. By following the agreed rules, everyone will be aware of what they are doing and how will it affect the productivity of other people working or living together with you. It opens the door to civic participation - the voice of the people is the most important factor in deciding what law should be passed. Since they are the number one beneficiary of it, people's opinion, feelings, and experiences are the bases of law to be agreed and passed by our legislators. Even when some legislators tend to pursue personal satisfaction by the use of authority, people who opposes the misconduct may gather and express their disagreement by conducting rallies and the like. With this, people can practice their right to be heard and be considered. <p></p><strong>Oftentimes, there are situations where law brings unfavorable results to us. Here are some:</strong>Improper use of authority - this is one of the existing issues still unresolved up to this time. Legislators who wants to gain wealth tends to act inappropriately as public servants and uses their position in the government to take the lead over his constituents. Some of the laws created are detrimental in nature to a specific group of people and situation. Also, there are projects headed by some legislators are not finished yet was declared as functional and existing. This is the worst manifestation of corruption when someone has authority and power.Differentiated interpretation - some of the laws are vague to the point that some constituents misinterpret the law, resulting to poor implementation of the said law. Also, people who exercise people feel that they are exempted in the implementation of the law that they don't follow it. Because of different understanding of the law, people don't observe it. They have different actions to a specific protocol because of different interpretations. As a general rule, agreed and passed law should be carried out from the highest official to the lowest member of the government, excluding no one. <p></p><strong>How can we enjoy and appreciate the existing laws?</strong>Observe and follow the rules - rules are created for us to enjoy life and our resources. Once you go out and do something inappropriate, you need to face its consequences. You will not be punished if you obey what is expected and intended to you. Do not plan anything harmful - if you are mindful of others and their welfare, law will support you in pursuing your goal. It will also protect you from other people who are judging you. As long as you are doing what is specified and observing proper protocols, then law is your friend, not an enemy.<p></p><p>For more information about this topic, you may also check the links below:</p>What are the positive and negative impacts of the law? brainly.ph/question/999920If you were to make a law in the Philippines, what would it be?

In contrast, this review is about the positive and negative effects that constructive and destructive parental conflict behaviours have on a child’s condition and behaviour. It employs the cognitive-contextual framework of Grych and Fincham (1990) and the emotional security hypothesis of Davies and Cummings (1994). Parental conflicts are represented as a continuum from very destructive to very constructive behaviours. Depending on the style of parental conflict behaviour, children’s emotional reactions and behaviour vary from positive to negative, and are moderated or mediated by different variables. A replication of previous findings and additional research are needed for a comprehensive understanding of this relationship and of the underlying mechanisms.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer: The Responsible Parenthood and Reproductive Health Act of 2012 (Republic Act No. 10354), informally known as the Reproductive Health Law, is a law in the Philippines which guarantees universal access to methods of contraception, fertility control, sexual education, and maternal care. The disadvantage of the Reproductive Health Bill in the Philippines is the undue focus being given to reproductive health and population and development, when many more urgent and important health problems need to be addressed in the country, those that cause a significant number of deaths across the country such as cardiovascular diseases and infections. The advantages of the law however seems to be of more relevance. In the advent of poverty, price increases, STDs, AIDs and other crisis, we need to help our people, especially those on the lower end of the financial ladder, take care of their family by not having too many children too soon too fast and we can’t do that with the natural method because that method has failed over and over and over again. The reproductive health bill not only gives us a choice of which contraception is best for us—it prevents couples from having too many children whom they can’t feed, too many children whom they will leave to die in malnutrition, too many children who will not have an education.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Read more here: https://graduateway.com/analyzing-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-the-reproductive-health-bill/</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>"Positive affect" refers to one's propensity to experience positive emotions and interact with others and with life's challenges in a positive way. Conversely, "negative affect" involves experiencing the world in a more negative way, feeling negative emotions and more negativity in relationships and surroundings.</strong></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The positive impacts of law are:</p><p>It protects the citizens from maltreatment - law is intended to protect and maintain peace in a place. If someone plans to inflict harm and conflict, there will be a corresponding punishments in every harmful action they will commit. Also, different governments have their own different set of rules that may be contradicting to other nearby places so people should be mindful that they should observe, follow, and respect the existing laws implemented in that country. Living in peace is the end goal of law.</p><p>It keeps our actions and processes in order - since everyone has their own means and methods of doing things, there will be instances that they might offend or hurt others that will result to quarrels and arguments. By following the agreed rules, everyone will be aware of what they are doing and how will it affect the productivity of other people working or living together with you.</p><p>It opens the door to civic participation - the voice of the people is the most important factor in deciding what law should be passed. Since they are the number one beneficiary of it, people's opinion, feelings, and experiences are the bases of law to be agreed and passed by our legislators. Even when some legislators tend to pursue personal satisfaction by the use of authority, people who opposes the misconduct may gather and express their disagreement by conducting rallies and the like. With this, people can practice their right to be heard and be considered.</p><p>Oftentimes, there are situations where law brings unfavorable results to us. Here are some:</p><p>Improper use of authority - this is one of the existing issues still unresolved up to this time. Legislators who wants to gain wealth tends to act inappropriately as public servants and uses their position in the government to take the lead over his constituents. Some of the laws created are detrimental in nature to a specific group of people and situation. Also, there are projects headed by some legislators are not finished yet was declared as functional and existing. This is the worst manifestation of corruption when someone has authority and power.</p><p>Differentiated interpretation - some of the laws are vague to the point that some constituents misinterpret the law, resulting to poor implementation of the said law. Also, people who exercise people feel that they are exempted in the implementation of the law that they don't follow it. Because of different understanding of the law, people don't observe it. They have different actions to a specific protocol because of different interpretations. As a general rule, agreed and passed law should be carried out from the highest official to the lowest member of the government, excluding no one. </p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>:) Sana makatulong thanks :) </p><br />
