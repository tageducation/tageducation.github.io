to the use of appliances are all the end product of ________. Energy is the ability of a system to perform work. It is a
property that is not created, destroyed or generated. Its specific property is called ______________________. The
law simply depicts that energy can be transformed and modify but not created. Energy resources are mostly
composed of ____________ and _________________. Natural resources are classified into renewable energy and
non-renewable energy. ______________ energy resources are the type of energy that can be easily replenished in a
short period of time regardless of the consumption rate. On the other hand, _________________ energy resources
are the type of energy source that cannot be replaced immediately when consumed. It needs a million years to
develop or formed. The most common non-renewable energy source is _____________. Fossil fuels are composed of
three types namely the: natural gas, ______________, and ______________. All fossil fuels are made up of dead
plants and animals that is associated with temperature and pressure buried in million years. Burning of fossil fuels
comes with negative effects on the environment as it develops ______________. Other major source of energy is
hydroelectric energy and geothermal. Both energy source are renewable energy resources. Geothermal is the type of
energy that solely focus on the _______________ or land masses. Earth’s surface linkage produces hot temperature,
when hot temperature is present in the reservoir, steam is being created. The steams allow the turbine to rotate
creating an electricity. The ________________ power plant is a type of energy source that solely depends on the
water currents and _______.
The strong pressure and currents of water falling down generates a mechanical energy which is converted to
electricity. Both renewable energy resources are safer to the environment. However, both energy sources still

The existence of several fault lines across the country is a manifestation of the movements of these tectonic plates. A fault line is defined as a geological fracture wherein the movement of masses of rock has displaced parts of the Earth's crust. A rapid movement of a fault line may produce a powerful energy that can trigger a strong earthquake. There are five active fault lines in the country namely the Western Philippine Fault, the Eastern Philippine Fault, the South of Mindanao Fault, Central Philippine Fault and the Marikina/Valley Fault System. in Metro Manila, the "Big One" applies to a scenario wherein movements along straddles 10 kilometers in Rizal province while the West Valley Fault runs over more the Valley Fault System could trigger a 7.2-magnitude quake. The East Valley Fault than 100 km through the provinces of Bulacan, Rizal, Cavite and Laguna, and Metro Scientists claimed that the 100-km fault, which last moved in 1658, moves every 400 years, meaning the threat of a 7.2-magnitude quake is getting closer. Over the years, the Philippines has suffered a history of destructive and frequent earthquakes. Destruction of buildings and the loss of lives are not limited to the epicenter and nearby cities of the earthquake. https://business inquirer.net/269314/devastating-faults-of-the-big-one) 1.

The Brain, Heart, Lungs, Liver, Kidneys, Stomach, Small and Large intestines, Bones and Muscles. &gt;The Brain is the control center of the nervous system. There are billions of nerve cells in the Brain direct body activities. Messages to and from the Brain travel along nerve cells or neurons. It also controls the body automatic functions like contraction of the cardiac muscles. ''The three [ 3 ] main parts of the Brain are the Cerebrum, Cerebellum and the Brain stem [ medulla oblongata, pons ]. Each part has particular functions. &gt;The Cerebrum is the largest part of the brain. It is divided into four [ 4 ] distributed within the lobes&gt;The Cerebellum is concerned with the maintenance of posture and balance, and the coordination of movements. &gt;The Brain stem has three parts, the medulla, pons, and midbrain. &gt;The Medulla controls the involuntary activities such as breathing and heart rate. &gt;The Pons connects the major motor and sensory nerves from the spinal cord, medulla and cerebellum with the midbrain and cerebrum. &gt;The Midbrain controls eye movements and size of pupils. It also coordinates head movement with isght and soundActivity No.2 Read and Answer1. How does the Brain work?A_____________B._____________C._____________D._____________B. The Heart is just as big as your fist. Its located in the thoracic cavity just behind the breastbone and between the lungs. It is hollow muscular organ. It's wall encloses four [ 4 ] chambers and the whole heart is enclosed in a sac called pericardium. It beats day and night without stopping and will continue to do so for as long as an individual lives. A healthy heart contracts about 75 times a minute or 4500 times an hour. &gt;Function of the heart:The heart is the pump that enables blood to circulate around the body. The automatic and rhythmic contraction of its muscles enables the body to meet its needs. It is an efficient machine that generates its own power for as long as it supplied with nutrients and energy.1. Describe how the Heart looks like?2. How does the Heart function?3. Where is the heart located?4. Which is the pumping organ of the body?5. How many heartbeats does the heart do in a minute?C. THE LUNGS are organs that supply oxygen to and remove carbon dioxide from the blood. Lungs are made up mainly of epithelial tissue and connective tissue. In the Lungs, oxygen from the air and exhaled. The oxygen-rich blood cells is transported throughout the body. Activity No.1B.1.How does the Lungs work for the body? 2.What are the gases that are supplied to and removed from the blood? A.___________B.___________​3.What kind of tissues are the lungs made up?A.___________B.___________D.The Liver is the largest solid organ in the body. It is a four pound organ highly efficient chemical processing tissue that produces chemicals that flow into the small intestine to help in degistion. It removes toxin from the blood. It can be located by placing our left hand over our right , lowermost ribs, your hand covers the area of the liver.Without the liver, digestion will be impossible and the conversion on food into living cells and energy practically nonexistent. The liver function can be roughly divided into those that breakdown food molecules and those that build up or reconstitute these nutrients into a form that the body can use or store efficiently.Activity No.1A.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Anaerobic A-Lactic (ATP-CP) Energy System</p><p>Athletes who compete in sports that require high amounts of short duration acceleration—shot-putters, weight lifters, American football linemen, gymnasts, or sprint-distance speed skaters use the anaerobic a-lactic system. The ALA system does not create energy for sufficient duration to create a great deal of waste products.</p><p></p><p>2. Anaerobic Lactic (Glycolytic) Energy System</p><p>The anaerobic lactic (AL) system (also known as fast glycolysis) provides energy for medium to high intensity bursts of activity that lasts from ten seconds to two minutes. Some American football skill positions, baseball players, soccer players, judokas, middle distance runners (400m-800m) and sprinters rely on this system. The anaerobic lactic system, as well as the ATP-CP system, are capable of high intensity levels, and do not rely on oxygen for fuel.</p><p></p><p>3. Aerobic Energy System</p><p>The aerobic system is the most utilized of the three. It provides energy for low intensity activities that last anywhere from two minutes to a few hours. Unlike the other two systems, the aerobic system requires oxygen and takes much longer to overload. Sports and activities that use continuous sustained efforts such as long distance swimming, crew (rowing) and sea kayaking rely on the aerobic system.</p><br />

property that is not created, destroyed or generated. Its specific property is called ______________________. The
law simply depicts that energy can be transformed and modify but not created. Energy resources are mostly
composed of ____________ and _________________. Natural resources are classified into renewable energy and
non-renewable energy. ______________ energy resources are the type of energy that can be easily replenished in a
short period of time regardless of the consumption rate. On the other hand, _________________ energy resources
are the type of energy source that cannot be replaced immediately when consumed. It needs a million years to
develop or formed. The most common non-renewable energy source is _____________. Fossil fuels are composed of
three types namely the: natural gas, ______________, and ______________. All fossil fuels are made up of dead
plants and animals that is associated with temperature and pressure buried in million years. Burning of fossil fuels
comes with negative effects on the environment as it develops ______________. Other major source of energy is
hydroelectric energy and geothermal. Both energy source are renewable energy resources. Geothermal is the type of
energy that solely focus on the _______________ or land masses. Earth’s surface linkage produces hot temperature,
when hot temperature is present in the reservoir, steam is being created. The steams allow the turbine to rotate
creating an electricity. The ________________ power plant is a type of energy source that solely depends on the
water currents and _______.
The strong pressure and currents of water falling down generates a mechanical energy which is converted to
electricity. Both renewable energy resources are safer to the environment. However, both energy sources still

                            11. Objed inactive fault every day Directions Read the following article then answer the questions that follow Earthquakes occur quite frequently in the Philippines due largely to its location The country lies along the "Pacific Ring of Fire," home to several tectonic plate boundaries that stretch from Indonesia to the coast of Chile within a 40.000-km arc of seismic violence that triggers volcanic eruptions and unleashes earthquakes almost Three tectonic plates that encircle the country are the Philippine Plate in the East the Eurasian Plate in the West; and the Indo-Australian Plate in the South. The existence of several fault lines across the country is a manifestation of the movements of these tectonic plates. A fault line is defined as a geological fracture wherein the movement of masses of rock has displaced parts of the Earth's crust. A rapid movement of a fault line may produce a powerful energy that can trigger a strong earthquake. There are five active fault lines in the country namely the Western Philippine Fault, the Eastern Philippine Fault, the South of Mindanao Fault, Central Philippine Fault and the Marikina/Valley Fault System. in Metro Manila, the "Big One" applies to a scenario wherein movements along straddles 10 kilometers in Rizal province while the West Valley Fault runs over more the Valley Fault System could trigger a 7.2-magnitude quake. The East Valley Fault than 100 km through the provinces of Bulacan, Rizal, Cavite and Laguna, and Metro Scientists claimed that the 100-km fault, which last moved in 1658, moves every 400 years, meaning the threat of a 7.2-magnitude quake is getting closer. Over the years, the Philippines has suffered a history of destructive and frequent earthquakes. Destruction of buildings and the loss of lives are not limited to the epicenter and nearby cities of the earthquake. https://business inquirer.net/269314/devastating-faults-of-the-big-one) 1.

                            23. A. Activity No.1. Flashback/ Throwback1.Can you name the major organs of our body? a. The Brain, Heart, Lungs, Liver, Kidneys, Stomach, Small and Large intestines, Bones and Muscles. &gt;The Brain is the control center of the nervous system. There are billions of nerve cells in the Brain direct body activities. Messages to and from the Brain travel along nerve cells or neurons. It also controls the body automatic functions like contraction of the cardiac muscles. ''The three [ 3 ] main parts of the Brain are the Cerebrum, Cerebellum and the Brain stem [ medulla oblongata, pons ]. Each part has particular functions. &gt;The Cerebrum is the largest part of the brain. It is divided into four [ 4 ] distributed within the lobes&gt;The Cerebellum is concerned with the maintenance of posture and balance, and the coordination of movements. &gt;The Brain stem has three parts, the medulla, pons, and midbrain. &gt;The Medulla controls the involuntary activities such as breathing and heart rate. &gt;The Pons connects the major motor and sensory nerves from the spinal cord, medulla and cerebellum with the midbrain and cerebrum. &gt;The Midbrain controls eye movements and size of pupils. It also coordinates head movement with isght and soundActivity No.2 Read and Answer1. How does the Brain work?A_____________B._____________C._____________D._____________B. The Heart is just as big as your fist. Its located in the thoracic cavity just behind the breastbone and between the lungs. It is hollow muscular organ. It's wall encloses four [ 4 ] chambers and the whole heart is enclosed in a sac called pericardium. It beats day and night without stopping and will continue to do so for as long as an individual lives. A healthy heart contracts about 75 times a minute or 4500 times an hour. &gt;Function of the heart:The heart is the pump that enables blood to circulate around the body. The automatic and rhythmic contraction of its muscles enables the body to meet its needs. It is an efficient machine that generates its own power for as long as it supplied with nutrients and energy.1. Describe how the Heart looks like?2. How does the Heart function?3. Where is the heart located?4. Which is the pumping organ of the body?5. How many heartbeats does the heart do in a minute?C. THE LUNGS are organs that supply oxygen to and remove carbon dioxide from the blood. Lungs are made up mainly of epithelial tissue and connective tissue. In the Lungs, oxygen from the air and exhaled. The oxygen-rich blood cells is transported throughout the body. Activity No.1B.1.How does the Lungs work for the body? 2.What are the gases that are supplied to and removed from the blood? A.___________B.___________​3.What kind of tissues are the lungs made up?A.___________B.___________D.The Liver is the largest solid organ in the body. It is a four pound organ highly efficient chemical processing tissue that produces chemicals that flow into the small intestine to help in degistion. It removes toxin from the blood. It can be located by placing our left hand over our right , lowermost ribs, your hand covers the area of the liver.Without the liver, digestion will be impossible and the conversion on food into living cells and energy practically nonexistent. The liver function can be roughly divided into those that breakdown food molecules and those that build up or reconstitute these nutrients into a form that the body can use or store efficiently.Activity No.1A.
