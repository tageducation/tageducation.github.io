                                            Read carefully the following case and explain your answer in not more than five (5) sentences.
 Menggay’s water consumption for the months of March, April, and May was billed on May 15, amounting to P6,000.00. When she went to the water district office, she was informed that the billed amount is for three months consolidated in a single bill due to the ECQ period. Still unbelieving and dismayed of the big amount she has to pay, she requested a detailed billing, and she discovered that a penalty of 10% was charged per month of overdue. She argued that the penalty takes the place of indemnity for damages, therefore it is not justified because she has no liability for damages to the water district. The water district office reasoned that the service contract stipulates a penalty of 10% for overdue payment.

                                            Menggay’s water consumption for the months of March, April, and May was billed on May 15, amounting to P6,000.00. When she went to the water district office, she was informed that the billed amount is for three months consolidated in a single bill due to the ECQ period. Still unbelieving and dismayed of the big amount she has to pay, she requested a detailed billing, and she discovered that a penalty of 10% was charged per month of overdue. She argued that the penalty takes the place of indemnity for damages, therefore it is not justified because she has no liability for damages to the water district. The water district office reasoned that the service contract stipulates a penalty of 10% for overdue payment. Decide the case</a>

In the matrix provided below, copy the section that presents the Thesis, Antithesis and SynthesisIt was an undying issue whether divorce should be legalized or not. Divorce is a process of legally separating two individuals who were bound by marriage. For me, it is completely sound.Around 17 Million children were reported homeless by World Health Organization. It was mentioned that 78% of this is caused by lack of family. Hence, approval of this bill is tantamount to subjecting children to an unnecessary suffering.However, around 50 million women were being abused everyday due to failing marriage. Hunger, fractures, and moral damages were an understatement to their husband. This means that divorce could be a gateway for a better life for a wrong decision that was.Divorce, though many are against, remains as one of the votalite options for curing a failing marriage. It is therefore the responsibility or our country's law-making bodies to fast track the approval of this bill into law. There may never be a perfect marriage, but a peaceful life is achievable when all of us are proactive to the evolving need of the societyThesis :Antithesis:Synthesis:​</a>

                                            The short story "The Lottery" by Shirley Jackson takes place a few hundred years ago on June 27 in a small town. The townspeople start the day as they normally would, but then at 10:00 all the residents had to report to the town square. Mr. Summers led the process. He brought with him a box with small pieces of paper inside of it. His first order of business was to take role and make sure he knew who was the head of each family and which members could not attend.  Mrs. Hutchinson arrived after he had been sworn in, declaring that she had forgotten what day it was to the amusement of those people who heard her. If the head male of the family were deceased or incapable of coming as in Clyde Dunbar's case due to a broken leg, then a son over the age of sixteen could stand in or the wife would have to pick for the family. As Mr. Summers called each family name, the representative would come forward and pick a piece of paper from the box without looking at it. While this process went on, some of the townspeople talked about how the north village was talking about giving up the lottery process. The older people in the crowd seemed to think that was ridiculous, saying "lottery in June, corn be heavy soon," but the younger members thought the idea had merit.  When Old Man Warner drew his slip, he declared it was his seventy-seventh time participating in the lottery. The last few people took their slips before everyone opened them. The crowd looked around wondering which family had the piece of paper with the black spot on it. It was Bill Hutchinson. Mrs. Dunbar told her oldest son to run and tell the news to his dad back at home.  Tessie Hutchinson immediately becomes defensive, saying her husband didn't have enough time, and it wasn't fair, but those around her encouraged her to calm down, including her husband who told her to shut her mouth. Then Mr. Summers focused in on the members of the Hutchinson family, which included Tessie and Bill along with their three children: Bill, Jr., Nancy, and Dave.  Since Dave was onl</a>

 Menggay’s water consumption for the months of March, April, and May was billed on May 15, amounting to P6,000.00. When she went to the water district office, she was informed that the billed amount is for three months consolidated in a single bill due to the ECQ period. Still unbelieving and dismayed of the big amount she has to pay, she requested a detailed billing, and she discovered that a penalty of 10% was charged per month of overdue. She argued that the penalty takes the place of indemnity for damages, therefore it is not justified because she has no liability for damages to the water district. The water district office reasoned that the service contract stipulates a penalty of 10% for overdue payment.

In the matrix provided below, copy the section that presents the Thesis, Antithesis and SynthesisIt was an undying issue whether divorce should be legalized or not. Divorce is a process of legally separating two individuals who were bound by marriage. For me, it is completely sound.Around 17 Million children were reported homeless by World Health Organization. It was mentioned that 78% of this is caused by lack of family. Hence, approval of this bill is tantamount to subjecting children to an unnecessary suffering.However, around 50 million women were being abused everyday due to failing marriage. Hunger, fractures, and moral damages were an understatement to their husband. This means that divorce could be a gateway for a better life for a wrong decision that was.Divorce, though many are against, remains as one of the votalite options for curing a failing marriage. It is therefore the responsibility or our country's law-making bodies to fast track the approval of this bill into law. There may never be a perfect marriage, but a peaceful life is achievable when all of us are proactive to the evolving need of the societyThesis :Antithesis:Synthesis:​</h2><br />

                            17. The short story "The Lottery" by Shirley Jackson takes place a few hundred years ago on June 27 in a small town. The townspeople start the day as they normally would, but then at 10:00 all the residents had to report to the town square. Mr. Summers led the process. He brought with him a box with small pieces of paper inside of it. His first order of business was to take role and make sure he knew who was the head of each family and which members could not attend.  Mrs. Hutchinson arrived after he had been sworn in, declaring that she had forgotten what day it was to the amusement of those people who heard her. If the head male of the family were deceased or incapable of coming as in Clyde Dunbar's case due to a broken leg, then a son over the age of sixteen could stand in or the wife would have to pick for the family. As Mr. Summers called each family name, the representative would come forward and pick a piece of paper from the box without looking at it. While this process went on, some of the townspeople talked about how the north village was talking about giving up the lottery process. The older people in the crowd seemed to think that was ridiculous, saying "lottery in June, corn be heavy soon," but the younger members thought the idea had merit.  When Old Man Warner drew his slip, he declared it was his seventy-seventh time participating in the lottery. The last few people took their slips before everyone opened them. The crowd looked around wondering which family had the piece of paper with the black spot on it. It was Bill Hutchinson. Mrs. Dunbar told her oldest son to run and tell the news to his dad back at home.  Tessie Hutchinson immediately becomes defensive, saying her husband didn't have enough time, and it wasn't fair, but those around her encouraged her to calm down, including her husband who told her to shut her mouth. Then Mr. Summers focused in on the members of the Hutchinson family, which included Tessie and Bill along with their three children: Bill, Jr., Nancy, and Dave.  Since Dave was onl</h2><br />
