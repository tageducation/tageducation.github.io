Mutual respect</p><p></p><p><strong>EXPLANATION:</strong></p><p><strong>1. Both want to care and be involved</strong></p><p>A love relationship that is always healthy, lasting, and harmonious must be strengthened by the inner bond between you and your partner. Explained further by <strong>Dr. Sue Johnson</strong>, a clinical psychologist in the United States, a relationship can be vulnerable to shattering and breaking up without an <strong>equally strong bond </strong>between the two of you. Just imagine a bridge that stretches over the surface of the water. If only one side is strong, the bridge will easily break over time because it is not supported by the other side.</p><p></p><p><strong>2. Honest and open communication</strong></p><p>Communication and openness are the keys to a lasting and harmonious relationship that is far from squabbling. Even small lies that may seem trivial at first can be disastrous if either party finds out. Likewise with keeping <strong>secrets</strong> from your partner, for whatever reason. This is because it means you don't <strong>trust</strong> your partner completely.</p><p></p><p><strong>3. Not all demanding</strong></p><p>Every human being is a unique individual who has different characteristics from one another. So if you are ready to have a romantic relationship with someone, it means that you also have to be <strong>ready with all the advantages and disadvantages</strong> of that person.</p><p></p><p><strong>4. Mutual respect</strong></p><p>A healthy relationship involves two people who are <strong>fair and equally strong</strong>, like a partnership. No one person should be of a higher rank or feel more special than the other. Neither party should be harmed.</p><p></p><p>Learn more about <strong>type of relationship depends on the degree of intimacy that a person showed to a certain individual:</strong></p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/10830430</p><p></p><p>#SPJ6</p><br />
