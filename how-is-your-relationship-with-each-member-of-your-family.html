Since this whole COVID-19 started, I got to spend more time with them. I like doing my own things and minding my own business though. To tell you the truth, they can be bothersome but it's not like I can do much about that. For my sibling/s, our relationship isn't too bad, but it isn't too good either. We often fight because of pointless things (and I always win in the end, lol.) As a result, of course our parents would scold us and yada yada.. so on and so forth. My relationship with my parents are normal, except I don't really like dealing with adults. I just end up talking to my grandparents because I really love listening to their stories and memories back then. My aunts and uncles, it's the typical interaction you'd expect. Meet and greet here and there whenever there's an event. I'm not the social type so I don't really start a conversation with my family unless I'm either bored or the air just feels tense and awkward. </p><br />

                            26. 5. How can your relationship influence each member of thefamily​</h2><br />
                        <p>Your relationship with a spouse/partner influences all members of your family, but most obviously so for children and grandchildren. Children (and grandchildren) will likely have an easier time adjusting to their new environment if there was some sort of history behind the change. For example, if you were married before moving to another state, it might be hard for you as an adult to move away again; however, it may be much less difficult if the reason you moved was due to marriage rather than divorce or death. Your current relationships can help ease adjustment as well. If your son has recently had trouble at school, he may feel more comfortable staying home this summer if his parents are nearby. In contrast, if your daughter-in-law just got her first job, she could possibly benefit from spending several weeks helping around the house.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>ofcourse it depends on how you and your family communicates with each other, if you're in a good relationship with them  just do as you are used to and and practice being more closer to each other, if you're not in good terms with your family, it would be awkward if you suddenly change your way of socializing with them from how you used to treat them. I suggest to do it slowly or step by step until you and also they can get used to it. Of course God's help would play the biggest part of this relationship.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>hope it helps :)) &lt;3</p><br />
