In claiming our human rights, we are making a moral claim, normally on our own government, that you cannot do that, because it is a violation of my moral sphere and my personal dignity. No-one – no individual, no government – can ever take away our human rights.</p><p></p><p>2.They come from the fact that we are not only physical beings, but also moral and spiritual human beings. Human rights are needed to protect and preserve every individual's humanity, to ensure that every individual can live a life of dignity and a life that is worthy of a human being.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>#Nagpakahirap PO ako mag type Kaya Sana pa #brainlest PO </p><p></p>At Kung saan kayo nyo lang masulat hehe<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>ADVOCACY FOR THE COMMON GOOD: ACTION, ORGANIZATION, AND POWER</p><p></p><p>Advocacy is the mobilization of resources and power to deal with societal problems.  It combines protest against what you don’t want, pushing for what you do want, and partnering with those responsible for implementation to make sure you actually get what you want  – although it is the pushing that we most generally think of as “advocacy”.  Advocacy starts through the spread of motivating information and bringing people together.  Having ideas and energy is vital, but not enough.  Success requires having the momentum and power to actually implement the desired change.  Vision and talk are the starting points.  Changed awareness – knowledge and empathy – and vital building blocks, but the goal of Advocacy is visible change in individual and social reality – which almost always requires action.  Advocacy occurs when you seek change outside yourself, in the surrounding world.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The advocacy that i want to promote in our society is for the people to have their voices heard on issues that are important to them. Protect and promote their rights. Have their views and wishes genuinely considered when decisions are being made about their lives.</p><p>WARNING: please use this as an idea only so that your teacher cannot misunderstand you as a cheater.  *i saw this on internet*</p><p>If possible, can you make me the brainliest? it motivates me to answer more questions.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

Even if you don’t win, participating in the competition can yield dividends in terms of getting your work out there. In fact, this is considered one of the most cost-effective ways for beginning artists to gain valuable experience and build their resumes.</p><p></p><p>Esther Huser, winner of Chelsea International Fine Art Competition, 2016</p><p>Choose which competitions to enter based on which would best aid your current career goals. If you are working on making a name for yourself in your medium and want to impress your fellow water color artists (for instance) then water color competitions might suit you best.</p><p></p><p>Similarly, if you are interested in taking your career to the national or international level, competitions with awards which will help you do that are the most sensible to enter. The Chelsea International Fine Art Competition, which Agora Gallery sponsors every year, is a great example of a competition with awards which are designed to help artists to increase their exposure and develop their career.</p><p></p><p>#2 – Look For Gallery Representation</p><p>If all this seems a bit overwhelming to you, know that there is help out there. Promotional galleries like Agora are attractive to artists for precisely this reason. Working with an established, respectable gallery will propel your career forward, sometimes beyond your dreams. The scope of representation varies with each gallery, but you can usually count on exhibitions, various promotions, participation in events, and public relations.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p> { Solidarity }<p></p>We are one  human family whatever our national, racial, ethnic, economic, and ideological  differences. We are our brothers’ and sisters’ keepers, wherever they may be.  Loving our neighbor has global dimensions in a shrinking world. At the core of  the virtue of solidarity is the pursuit of justice and peace. Pope Paul VI  taught that “if you want peace, work for justice.”1 The Gospel calls us to be  peacemakers. Our love for all our sisters and brothers demands that we promote  peace in a world surrounded by violence and conflict.<p></p><br />
