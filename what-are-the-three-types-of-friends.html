Elephant and FriendsOne day an elephant wandered into a forest in search of friends. He saw a monkey on a tree. "Will you be my friend? asked the elephant. Replied the monkey, "You are too big. You cannot swing from trees like me. "Next, the elephant met a rabbit. He asked him to be his friend. But the rabbit said, "You are too big to play in my burrow! "Then the elephant met a frog. " Will you be my friend? He asked. "How can I? "asked the frog. "You are too big to leap like me. "Then the elephant was upset. He met a fox next. "Will you be my friend? he asked the fox. The fox said "Sorry sir, you are too big. "The next day, the elephant saw all the animals in the forest running for their lives. The elephant asked them what the matter was. The bear replied, "There is a tiger in the forest. He's trying to gobble us up! "The animals ran away to hide. The elephant wondered what he could do to save everyone in the forest. Meanwhile, the tiger kept eating up whoever he could find. The elephant has no choice but to give the tiger a hefty kick. The frightened tiger ran for his life. The elephant ambled back into the forest to announce the good news to everyone. All the animals thanked the elephant. They said, You are just the right size to be our friend.Title of information text:________Type of information next:________Three informational gathered from text:______Paki answer po​</a>

                                            thank you for helping meFriends can  be  classified  according  to  their honesty ,  loyalty , the  type  that  fits  you  into  their  schedule ,  or  the  type  that  finds  time  for  you  when  they  need  something.  An  honest  friend  tells  you  the  truth  even  if  it’s  not  always  what  you  want  to  hear.  In  the  long  run ,  that  honest  friend  may  have  saved  you  from  embarrassment  or  possibly  rejection.  They give you  constructive  criticisms  overall.  The  loyal  friend  is  the  type  of  friend  that  will  be  there  for  you  through  thick  and  thin.  They  don’t  care  how  good  or  bad  you  may  look  one  day;  they  are  sensitive  to  your  feelings ,  they  respect  you  and  the  other  people  in  your  life,  and  most  of  all  they  will  never  let  you  down  when  times  are  hard.  They may  be  what  you  call  a  best  friend.  The  third  group,  the  person  that  fits  you  into  their  schedule ,  is  the  type  of  person  that  is  always  on  the  go. They barely have  time  for  themselves  let  alone  another  person.  More  than  likely  they  will  not  be  there  for  you  when  you  need  them  most,  because  they  are  so  wrapped  up  in  their  busy  ,  hectic  life.  Then  you  have  the  self-absorbent  type of  friend  that  finds  time  for  you  only  when  they  need  something. This  type  of  person isn’t  what  you  would  call  a  friend.  This  person  may  always  be  extremely  nice  to  you  because  they  know  that from being nice they will more than likely get what they want. They  will call  you  every  once  in  a while  when  it is almost  time  for  them  to  use  that  person  again.  It  may  be  for  a  ride  to  work,  home  or  they  just  want  somebody  to  hangout  with  because  they  have  no  other  friends.  If  the  person  that  is  being  used  is  smart  they  will eventually  realize  that  they  are  getting  used  and  will  stop  being  there  for  that  person.

The fox said "Sorry sir, you are too big. "The next day, the elephant saw all the animals in the forest running for their lives. The elephant asked them what the matter was. The bear replied, "There is a tiger in the forest. He's trying to gobble us up! "The animals ran away to hide. The elephant wondered what he could do to save everyone in the forest. Meanwhile, the tiger kept eating up whoever he could find. The elephant has no choice but to give the tiger a hefty kick. The frightened tiger ran for his life.

                            16. 3. Choose three types of Intellectual Property from the lesson and give one sample scenario for each type. The scenario can be something from your own experience, or the experience of your classmates and friends, or it can also be something from what you have read in the news. Discuss the scenario, what happened, and how it was dealt with.​</h2><br />
                        The Main Types of Intellectual Property1.) Trademarks<p><strong> A trademark is anything that represents your brand to consumers.  The most common trademarks are business and product names, logos, and slogans, but non-traditional trademarks can be registered as well.  Anything from a color scheme to a sound or even a smell can become a registered trademark if it represents your business in the marketplace.</strong></p><p></p>2.) Copyright<p><strong>A copyright protects a work of authorship.  Creative works like books, paintings, plays, photographs, and even websites can receive copyright protection.  While trademarks protect owners against any mark that may be confusingly similar, copyright protections are limited to exact works of authorship or very close replicas.  Ideas and concepts themselves are not protected, but rather how they are expressed.  For example, the concept of painting water lilies is not protected, but Claude Monet’s famous interpretation is.</strong></p><p></p>3.) Patents<p><strong>A patent can protect an invention.  To receive patent protection, an invention must be novel, useful, and non-obvious.  The USPTO recognizes three categories of patents:</strong></p><p></p><strong>Utility patents protect how an invention is made or how an invention works. How a Bluetooth speaker amplifies sound, for instance, may be eligible for a utility patent.</strong><strong>Design patents protect the unique non-functional design or appearance of an invention. The sleek design of a new smartphone or Bluetooth speaker may be protected by a design patent.</strong><strong>Plant patents protect new asexually reproduced plant varieties where part of the plant, other than the seeds, is used to generate a new plant, e.g., through grafting or layering. As an example, the honeycrisp apple tree is the subject of a plant patent.</strong><p></p>#caryonlearnings<br />

                            20. thank you for helping meFriends can  be  classified  according  to  their honesty ,  loyalty , the  type  that  fits  you  into  their  schedule ,  or  the  type  that  finds  time  for  you  when  they  need  something.  An  honest  friend  tells  you  the  truth  even  if  it’s  not  always  what  you  want  to  hear.  In  the  long  run ,  that  honest  friend  may  have  saved  you  from  embarrassment  or  possibly  rejection.  They give you  constructive  criticisms  overall.  The  loyal  friend  is  the  type  of  friend  that  will  be  there  for  you  through  thick  and  thin.  They  don’t  care  how  good  or  bad  you  may  look  one  day;  they  are  sensitive  to  your  feelings ,  they  respect  you  and  the  other  people  in  your  life,  and  most  of  all  they  will  never  let  you  down  when  times  are  hard.  They may  be  what  you  call  a  best  friend.  The  third  group,  the  person  that  fits  you  into  their  schedule ,  is  the  type  of  person  that  is  always  on  the  go. They barely have  time  for  themselves  let  alone  another  person.  More  than  likely  they  will  not  be  there  for  you  when  you  need  them  most,  because  they  are  so  wrapped  up  in  their  busy  ,  hectic  life.  Then  you  have  the  self-absorbent  type of  friend  that  finds  time  for  you  only  when  they  need  something. This  type  of  person isn’t  what  you  would  call  a  friend.  This  person  may  always  be  extremely  nice  to  you  because  they  know  that from being nice they will more than likely get what they want. They  will call  you  every  once  in  a while  when  it is almost  time  for  them  to  use  that  person  again.  It  may  be  for  a  ride  to  work,  home  or  they  just  want  somebody  to  hangout  with  because  they  have  no  other  friends.  If  the  person  that  is  being  used  is  smart  they  will eventually  realize  that  they  are  getting  used  and  will  stop  being  there  for  that  person.
