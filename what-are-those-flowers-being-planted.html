 HOW THE WORLD WAS CREATED (PANAYAN )
One of the stories about the creation of the world, which the old folks of
Panay, especially those living near the mountain , do not tire relating, tell us that in
the beginning there was no heaven or earth--- only bottomless deep and a world of
mist. Everything was shapeless and formless—the earth, the sky, the sea, and the
air were almost all mixed up.
Then from the depth of this formless void, there appeared two gods, ---
Tungkung Langit and Alunsina . Just where the two deities came from it was not
known. However, it is related that Tungkung Langit fell in love with Alunsina and ,
after so many years of courtship, they got married and had their abode in the highest
realm of the eternal space where the water was constantly warm and the breeze was
forever cool. It was in this place where order and regularity first took place.
Tungkung Langit was an industrious, loving and kind god whose chief concern
was how to impose order over the whole confused set-up of things. He assumed
responsibility for the regular cosmic movement. On the other hand, Alunsina was a
lazy, jealous , and selfish goddess whose only work was to sit by the window of their
Heavenly home , and amuse herself with her pointless thoughts. Sometimes, she
would go down from the house, sit down by a pool near their doorstep and comb her
long, jet – black hair all day long.
One day Tungkung Langit told his wife that he would be away from home for
some time to put an end to the chaotic disturbances in the flow of time and in the
position of things. The jealous Alunsina, however, sent the sea breeze to spy on
Tungkung Langit. This made the latter very angry upon knowing about it.
Immediately after his return from the trip, he called this act to her attention
saying that it was ungodly of her to be jealous, there being no other creature living in
the world except the two of them. This reproach was resented by Alunsina, and a
quarrel between them followed.
Tungkung Langit lost his temper. In his rage, he divested his wife of powers
and drove her away. No one knew where Alunsina went; she merely disappeared.
Several days after Alunsina left, however, Tungkung Langit felt very lonely.
He realized what he had done. Somehow it was too late even to be sorry about the
whole matter. The whole place once vibrant of Alunsina’s sweet voice suddenly
became cold and desolate. In the morning when he woke up he would find himself
alone and in the afternoon when he came home, he would feel the same loneliness
creeping deep in his heart because there was no one to meet him at the doorstep or
soothe the aching muscles of his arm.
For months, Tungkung Langit lived in utter desolation.He could not find
Alunsina, try hard as he would. And so, in his desperation, he decided to do
something in order to forget his sorrows. For months and months he thought. His
mind seemed pointless, his heart weary and sick. But he must have to do something
about his loneliness.
One day while he was sailing across the regions of the clouds, a thought
came to him. He would make a big basin of water below the sky so that he can see
the image of his wife, if she were just somewhere in the regions above. And lo! The
sea appeared. However, Alunsina was never seen.
After a long time, the somber sight of the lonely sea irritated Tungkung Langit.
So he came down to the Middleworld and created the land; them he planted this with
grasses, trees and flowers. He took his wife’s treasured jewels and scattered them in
the sky, hoping that when Alunsina would see them she might be induced to return
home , The goddess’ necklace became the stars, her comb the moon and her crown
the sun . However, despite all these Alunsina did not come back.
And up to this time, the folks in Panay say that Tungkung Langit is alone in his
palace in the skies. Sometimes, he would cry out of his pent – up emotions and his
tears will fall down upon the earth. The people say that the rain is Tungkung Langit’s
tears and that is why in some localities in the island of Panay, the first rain in May is
received with so much rejoicing and sacrifice. Incidentally, when it thunders hard, the
old folks also say that it is Tungkung Langit sobbing, calling for his beloved Alunsina
to come back - entreating her so hard that his voice thunders across the fields and
countryside.</a>

                                            Read here:::::::::::::::::::::::::BATS BY DEBBIE DEANIn the distant past, many people thought bats had magical powers, but times have changed. Today, many people believe that bats are rodents, that they cannot see, and that they are more likely than other animals to carry rabies. All of these beliefs are mistaken. Bats are not rodents, are not blind, and are no more likely than dogs and cats to transmit rabies. Bats, in fact, are among the least understood and least appreciated of animals. Bats are not rodents with wings, contrary to popular belief. Like all rodents, bats are mammals, but they have a skeleton similar to the human skeleton. The bones in bat wings are much like those in arms and the human hand, with a thumb and four fingers. In bats, the bones of the arms and the four fingers of the hands are very long. This bone structure helps support the web of skin that stretches fromthe body to the ends of the fingers to form wings. Although bats cannot see colors, they have good vision in both dim and bright light. Since most bats stay in darkness during the day and do their feeding at night, they do not use their vision to maneuver in the dark but use a process called echolocation. This process enables bats to emit sounds from their mouths that bounce off objects and allow them to avoid the objects when flying. They use this system to locate flying insects to feed on as well. Typically, insect-eating bats emerge at dusk and fly to streams or ponds where they feed. They catch the insects on their wingtip or tail membrane and fling them into their mouths while flying. There are about 1,000 species of bat, ranging in size from the bumblebee bat, which is about an inch long, to the flying fox, which is sixteen inches long and has a wingspan of five feet. Each type of bat has a specialized diet. For seventy percent of bats, the diet is insects. Other types of bats feed on flowers, pollen, nectar, and fruit or on small animals such as birds, mice, lizards, and frogs. One species of bat feeds on the blood of large mammals. This is the common vampire bat, which lives only in Latin America and is probably best known for feeding on the blood of cattle. Unfortunately, in an attempt to control vampire bat populations, farmers have unintentionally killed thousands of beneficial fruit-and insect-eating bats as well. Bats, in fact, perform a number of valuable functions. Their greatest economic value is in eliminating insect pests. Insect- eating bats can catch six hundred mosquitoes in an hour and eat half their body weight in insects every night. In many tropical rain forests, fruit eating bats are the main means of spreading the seeds of tropical fruits. Nectar-feeding bats pollinate a number of tropical plants. If it were not for bats, we might not have peaches, bananas, mangoes, guavas, figs, or dates.Today, the survival of many bat species is uncertain. Sixty percent of bats do not survive past infancy. Some are killed bypredators such as owls, hawks, snakes and other meat-eating creatures, but most are victims of pesticides and other human intrusions. In Carlsbad Caverns, New Mexico, where there were once eight million bats, there are now a quarter million. At Eagle Creek, Arizona, the bat population dropped from thirty million to thirty thousand in six years. Bats often have been burdened with a bad reputation, perhaps because they are not the warm, cuddly sort of animal we love to love. However, their unusual physical features should not lead us to overestimate their harm or to underestimate their value.1. What is the text about?2. Who is the author of the text?3.

 HOW THE WORLD WAS CREATED (PANAYAN )
One of the stories about the creation of the world, which the old folks of
Panay, especially those living near the mountain , do not tire relating, tell us that in
the beginning there was no heaven or earth--- only bottomless deep and a world of
mist. Everything was shapeless and formless—the earth, the sky, the sea, and the
air were almost all mixed up.
Then from the depth of this formless void, there appeared two gods, ---
Tungkung Langit and Alunsina . Just where the two deities came from it was not
known. However, it is related that Tungkung Langit fell in love with Alunsina and ,
after so many years of courtship, they got married and had their abode in the highest
realm of the eternal space where the water was constantly warm and the breeze was
forever cool. It was in this place where order and regularity first took place.
Tungkung Langit was an industrious, loving and kind god whose chief concern
was how to impose order over the whole confused set-up of things. He assumed
responsibility for the regular cosmic movement. On the other hand, Alunsina was a
lazy, jealous , and selfish goddess whose only work was to sit by the window of their
Heavenly home , and amuse herself with her pointless thoughts. Sometimes, she
would go down from the house, sit down by a pool near their doorstep and comb her
long, jet – black hair all day long.
One day Tungkung Langit told his wife that he would be away from home for
some time to put an end to the chaotic disturbances in the flow of time and in the
position of things. The jealous Alunsina, however, sent the sea breeze to spy on
Tungkung Langit. This made the latter very angry upon knowing about it.
Immediately after his return from the trip, he called this act to her attention
saying that it was ungodly of her to be jealous, there being no other creature living in
the world except the two of them. This reproach was resented by Alunsina, and a
quarrel between them followed.
Tungkung Langit lost his temper. In his rage, he divested his wife of powers
and drove her away. No one knew where Alunsina went; she merely disappeared.
Several days after Alunsina left, however, Tungkung Langit felt very lonely.
He realized what he had done. Somehow it was too late even to be sorry about the
whole matter. The whole place once vibrant of Alunsina’s sweet voice suddenly
became cold and desolate. In the morning when he woke up he would find himself
alone and in the afternoon when he came home, he would feel the same loneliness
creeping deep in his heart because there was no one to meet him at the doorstep or
soothe the aching muscles of his arm.
For months, Tungkung Langit lived in utter desolation.He could not find
Alunsina, try hard as he would. And so, in his desperation, he decided to do
something in order to forget his sorrows. For months and months he thought. His
mind seemed pointless, his heart weary and sick. But he must have to do something
about his loneliness.
One day while he was sailing across the regions of the clouds, a thought
came to him. He would make a big basin of water below the sky so that he can see
the image of his wife, if she were just somewhere in the regions above. And lo! The
sea appeared. However, Alunsina was never seen.
After a long time, the somber sight of the lonely sea irritated Tungkung Langit.
So he came down to the Middleworld and created the land; them he planted this with
grasses, trees and flowers. He took his wife’s treasured jewels and scattered them in
the sky, hoping that when Alunsina would see them she might be induced to return
home , The goddess’ necklace became the stars, her comb the moon and her crown
the sun . However, despite all these Alunsina did not come back.
And up to this time, the folks in Panay say that Tungkung Langit is alone in his
palace in the skies. Sometimes, he would cry out of his pent – up emotions and his
tears will fall down upon the earth. The people say that the rain is Tungkung Langit’s
tears and that is why in some localities in the island of Panay, the first rain in May is
received with so much rejoicing and sacrifice. Incidentally, when it thunders hard, the
old folks also say that it is Tungkung Langit sobbing, calling for his beloved Alunsina
to come back - entreating her so hard that his voice thunders across the fields and
countryside.</h2><br />

                            16. Read here:::::::::::::::::::::::::BATS BY DEBBIE DEANIn the distant past, many people thought bats had magical powers, but times have changed. Today, many people believe that bats are rodents, that they cannot see, and that they are more likely than other animals to carry rabies. All of these beliefs are mistaken. Bats are not rodents, are not blind, and are no more likely than dogs and cats to transmit rabies. Bats, in fact, are among the least understood and least appreciated of animals. Bats are not rodents with wings, contrary to popular belief. Like all rodents, bats are mammals, but they have a skeleton similar to the human skeleton. The bones in bat wings are much like those in arms and the human hand, with a thumb and four fingers. In bats, the bones of the arms and the four fingers of the hands are very long. This bone structure helps support the web of skin that stretches fromthe body to the ends of the fingers to form wings. Although bats cannot see colors, they have good vision in both dim and bright light. Since most bats stay in darkness during the day and do their feeding at night, they do not use their vision to maneuver in the dark but use a process called echolocation. This process enables bats to emit sounds from their mouths that bounce off objects and allow them to avoid the objects when flying. They use this system to locate flying insects to feed on as well. Typically, insect-eating bats emerge at dusk and fly to streams or ponds where they feed. They catch the insects on their wingtip or tail membrane and fling them into their mouths while flying. There are about 1,000 species of bat, ranging in size from the bumblebee bat, which is about an inch long, to the flying fox, which is sixteen inches long and has a wingspan of five feet. Each type of bat has a specialized diet. For seventy percent of bats, the diet is insects. Other types of bats feed on flowers, pollen, nectar, and fruit or on small animals such as birds, mice, lizards, and frogs. One species of bat feeds on the blood of large mammals. This is the common vampire bat, which lives only in Latin America and is probably best known for feeding on the blood of cattle. Unfortunately, in an attempt to control vampire bat populations, farmers have unintentionally killed thousands of beneficial fruit-and insect-eating bats as well. Bats, in fact, perform a number of valuable functions. Their greatest economic value is in eliminating insect pests. Insect- eating bats can catch six hundred mosquitoes in an hour and eat half their body weight in insects every night. In many tropical rain forests, fruit eating bats are the main means of spreading the seeds of tropical fruits. Nectar-feeding bats pollinate a number of tropical plants. If it were not for bats, we might not have peaches, bananas, mangoes, guavas, figs, or dates.Today, the survival of many bat species is uncertain. Sixty percent of bats do not survive past infancy. Some are killed bypredators such as owls, hawks, snakes and other meat-eating creatures, but most are victims of pesticides and other human intrusions. In Carlsbad Caverns, New Mexico, where there were once eight million bats, there are now a quarter million. At Eagle Creek, Arizona, the bat population dropped from thirty million to thirty thousand in six years. Bats often have been burdened with a bad reputation, perhaps because they are not the warm, cuddly sort of animal we love to love. However, their unusual physical features should not lead us to overestimate their harm or to underestimate their value.1. What is the text about?2. Who is the author of the text?3.
