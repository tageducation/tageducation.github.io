                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>One agent of socialization that has had a great influence on me is my family. From a young age, my family has provided me with a solid foundation of core values and morals that have shaped who I am today. From the teachings of my parents, I have learned the importance of being responsible, honest, and kind. Additionally, they have always encouraged me to strive for success and make the most out of every opportunity that I have been presented with. This mindset has driven me to pursue goals and ambitions that have provided me with valuable life lessons, new experiences, and allowed me to discover what makes me truly happy. With their support and guidance, I am able to stay focused and determined even in the toughest of times. Overall, I am grateful for my family and the invaluable life lessons and values that they have instilled in me.</p><p><strong>Definitely Family Socialization Agent<br /><br />Families can have both positive and negative influences as agents of socialization.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Answer here</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p>Social Group Agents</p><p></p><p>Social groups often provide the first experiences of socialization. Families, and later peer groups, communicate expectations and reinforce norms. People first learn to use the tangible objects of material culture in these settings, as well as being introduced to the beliefs and values of society.</p><p></p><p>Family</p><p></p><p>Family is the first agent of socialization. Mothers and fathers, siblings and grandparents, plus members of an extended family, all teach a child what he or she needs to know. For example, they show the child how to use objects (such as clothes, computers, eating utensils, books, bikes); how to relate to others (some as “family,” others as “friends,” still others as “strangers” or “teachers” or “neighbors”); and how the world works (what is “real” and what is “imagined”). As you are aware, either from your own experience as a child or from your role in helping to raise one, socialization includes teaching and learning about an unending array of objects and ideas.</p><p></p><p>Keep in mind, however, that families do not socialize children in a vacuum. Many social factors affect the way a family raises its children. For example, we can use sociological imagination to recognize that individual behaviors are affected by the historical period in which they take place. Sixty years ago, it would not have been considered especially strict for a father to hit his son with a wooden spoon or a belt if he misbehaved, but today that same action might be considered child abuse.</p><p></p><p>Sociologists recognize that race, social class, religion, and other societal factors play an important role in socialization. For example, poor families usually emphasize obedience and conformity when raising their children, while wealthy families emphasize judgment and creativity (National Opinion Research Center 2008). This may occur because working-class parents have less education and more repetitive-task jobs for which it is helpful to be able to follow rules and conform. Wealthy parents tend to have better educations and often work in managerial positions or careers that require creative problem solving, so they teach their children behaviors that are beneficial in these positions. This means children are effectively socialized and raised to take the types of jobs their parents already have, thus reproducing the class system (Kohn 1977). Likewise, children are socialized to abide by gender norms, perceptions of race, and class-related behaviors.</p><p></p><p>In Sweden, for instance, stay-at-home fathers are an accepted part of the social landscape. A government policy provides subsidized time off work—480 days for families with newborns—with the option of the paid leave being shared between mothers and fathers. As one stay-at-home dad says, being home to take care of his baby son “is a real fatherly thing to do. I think that’s very masculine” (Associated Press 2011). Close to 90 percent of Swedish fathers use their paternity leave (about 340,000 dads); on average they take seven weeks per birth (The Economist, 2014). How do U.S. policies—and our society’s expected gender roles—compare? How will Swedish children raised this way be socialized to parental gender norms? How might that be different from parental gender norms in the United States?</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>First, socialization teaches impulse control and helps individuals develop a conscience.

                        4 Main Cleaning Agents<strong>D</strong><strong>etergent</strong> is a surfactant or a mixture of surfactants with cleansing properties in dilute solutions. These substances are usually alkylbenzene sulfonates, a family of compounds that are similar to soap but are more soluble in hard water, because the polar sulfonate (of detergents) is less likely than the polar carboxylate (of soap) to bind to calcium and other ions found in hard water.<strong>Degreaser</strong> is a solvent-based or solvent-containing cleaning agent. It is a chemical product mostly used for the removal of water-insoluble substances such as grease, paint, oil, lubricants, corrosive products, abrasive dust and all other organic films. This cleaning agent is especially made for the removal of grease.<strong>A</strong><strong>brasive</strong> is a material, often a mineral, that is used to shape or finish a workpiece through rubbing[1] which leads to part of the workpiece being worn away by friction. <strong>Acid cleaning</strong> is a useful method to clean materials and wash away corroded parts. Among the commonly used cleaning agents are hydrochloric acid, also known as muriatic acid. This substance is commonly used for cleaning concrete as well as pools.<p></p><p>#CarryOnLearning</p><br />

                        The moral agent has a responsibility to develop his or her moral character by taking ownership of their thoughts, words, and actions. This lesson encourages the moral agent to be aware of their values and beliefs, to understand their own moral code, and to make conscious choices that are in alignment with this code so that they can become the moral person they aspire to be. Additionally, this lesson encourages the moral agent to reflect on how their decisions affect others and how they can strive to ensure that their decisions are fair, equitable, and just.<br />
