                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Corrosion, and as we all know, that's not good for machine operation. This prevents the production of rust, therefore preventing damage to the metal machine surfaces. So a lubricant is a substance that reduces friction, heat, and wear when introduced as a film between solid surfaces.</p><p></p><p>2. The machine should always be kept covered when not in use to protect from dirt and dust. Before attempting to clean the machine, it is wise to remove the needle to avoid the danger of sewing into the finger during the cleaning process.</p><p></p><p>3. Sorry I don't have an answer</p><p></p><p>4. The materials needed for cleaning are the following: </p><p>1. Screwdriver - these usually come with your machine.</p><p>2. Small brush -  to dust out all those tiny areas</p><p>3. Vacuum attachment kit (optional) – it’s great for getting in tight spaces</p><p>4. Tweezers</p><p>5. Rubbing alcohol</p><p>6. Magnifying glass - it's helpful for seeing in tiny crevic</p><p>7. Machine oil - make sure your oil has not discolore</p><p>8. Fabric scraps</p><p></p><p>5. Sewing machine oil is a white mineral oil, meaning it is clear and has no smell. The oil has a light viscosity and will not collect on the machine's gears. It is usually marketed as machine or sewing machine oil.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>hope this helps</p><br />
