Today we will talk about tree planting in the Philippines.</p><p>We know that may mountains are now denuded resulting in soil erosion and consequently, flash floods. These are weather events we do not like. These problems also have a very easy solution--stop the cutting of trees. But because they are no longer there, we need to start planting them.</p><p></p><p>EO 26, series of 2010 established the National Greening Program which jump started the massive tree planting we had been doing. In 2014 we even had the world record of planting over 3.2 million trees in an hour as part of the reforestation program. This was a significant number, </p><p></p><p>In 2017, the now Expanded National Greening Program has seen seedling planting activities under the program which covered 187,707 hectares nationwide. The target from 2011 to 2017 was to plant on 1.64 million hectares and we are now at 1.85 million hectares. So far we are doing good and hopefully it is not too late given that extreme weather events are now happening as a result of climate change.</p><p></p><p>Above was an example of an information speech on tree planting. Make sure that when you write an information speech you have the appropriate data on hand so that you can quote the necessary numbers.</p><p></p><p>For more information:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/33391</p><p></p><br />
