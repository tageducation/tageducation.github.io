I hope this task will help you explain the importance of focusing specimens using a compound microscope. Read the four different scenarios carefully and answer the question that follows on a separate paper. What Will You Do? Scenario 1: A student is tasked to observe a leaf under a microscope. She cut a small piece, put it on the slide and covered it with a cover slip. She then tried to use the scanning objective, focused the specimen using the coarse knob and switched to low power objective. She focused the specimen using a high power objective, but she cannot see the specimen very well. What do you think is wrong with the procedure? Scenario 2: You are focusing a specimen using a coarse adjustment knob in a high power objective. What do you think will happen? Scenario 3: The world is now experiencing a pandemic because of the newly discovered coronavirus. The Corona Virus Disease (COVID 19) affects the respiratory system of the body. How will your knowledge on using a microscope help in solving this pandemic? Scenario 4: If you are given a chance to observe and discover something, what would it be? How can it help the community?​</a>

                            14. I hope you learned a lot from this lesson. Now, it is time to apply what you have learned. I hope this task will help you explain the importance of focusing specimens using a compound microscope. Read the four different scenarios carefully and answer the question that follows on a separate paper. What Will You Do? Scenario 1: A student is tasked to observe a leaf under a microscope. She cut a small piece, put it on the slide and covered it with a cover slip. She then tried to use the scanning objective, focused the specimen using the coarse knob and switched to low power objective. She focused the specimen using a high power objective, but she cannot see the specimen very well. What do you think is wrong with the procedure? Scenario 2: You are focusing a specimen using a coarse adjustment knob in a high power objective. What do you think will happen? Scenario 3: The world is now experiencing a pandemic because of the newly discovered coronavirus. The Corona Virus Disease (COVID 19) affects the respiratory system of the body. How will your knowledge on using a microscope help in solving this pandemic? Scenario 4: If you are given a chance to observe and discover something, what would it be? How can it help the community?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Scenario 1:</p><p></p><p>There are different reasons. It might be because of the amount of light that passes through the lens. If this is the case, adjust the diaphragm to reach the right amount of light needed to properly observe the specimen It can also be that specimen might be too thick that the light cannot pass through it. In this situation, scrape the leaf to achieve the thinness of the specimen that is enough for the light to pass through it.</p><p></p><p>Scenario 2: When using a high power objective, it is important to remember NOT TO USE the coarse adjustment knob because it might break the cover slip or the glass slide itself.
