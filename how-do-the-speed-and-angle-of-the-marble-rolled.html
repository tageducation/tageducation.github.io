What have you observed to the movement of the marble rolled when the heavystone is replaced?3. What have you observed to the movement of the objects replacing the marblewhen rolled?4. How does the tablecloth activity demonstrate the effect of gravity on the movement of objects?​Answer:1.the marble started accerelating the angle didn't change and if you flick the marble it will became fast and the cloth won't affect the marble2.the marble collided with the heavy stone the marble going faster after colliding the marble reflected on the other direction left or right not going forward and a bit speed reduction.3.the marble got a bit of speed of reduction on the heavy stone and reflected not making it go forward making it go left and right and the cloth it didn't do much if the table is very long it might stop.4.the smaller the object the faster it is the heavier the object how slow it is more mass more gravity the cloth has some friction on it but the marble doesn't it's smooth so it won't affect to it that much.</a>

                        <p>1. The marble began <strong>accelerating</strong>, but the angle did not change, and if you flick the marble, it becomes fast and the cloth has no effect on the marble.</p><p></p><p>2. After hitting with the hefty stone, the marble reflected in the other direction, left or right, not moving ahead and with a slight speed drop.</p><p></p><p>3. The marble had a bit of speed reduction on the hefty stone and reflected not making it travel forward but going left and right and the cloth didn't do much if the table is really long it might halt.</p><p></p><p>4. The smaller the thing, the faster it is; the heavier the object, the slower it is; and the more mass, the greater the gravity. The cloth has some friction, but the marble does not because it is smooth, thus it will not be affected as much.</p><p></p>Gravitation<p>According to the <strong>law of gravitation</strong>, everybody in the universe attracts every other body but the strength depends on the distance between .gravity is nothing but the form with which attracts any other body present on earth</p><p></p>What is gravity?<p>Gravity is a force pulling together all matter (which is anything you can physically touch). The more matter, the more gravity, so things that have a lot of matter such as planets and moons and stars pull more strongly.</p><p></p><p><strong>Mass </strong>is how we measure the amount of matter in something. The more massive something is, the more of a gravitational pull it exerts. As we walk on the surface of the Earth, it pulls on us, and we pull back. But since the Earth is so much more massive than we are, the pull from us is not strong enough to move the Earth, while the pull from the Earth can make us fall flat on our faces.</p><p></p><p>In addition to depending on the amount of mass, gravity also depends on how far you are from something. This is why we are stuck to the surface of the Earth instead of being pulled off into the Sun, which has many more times the gravity of the Earth.</p><p></p><p><strong>Learn more about gravitation here: https://brainly.ph/question/18502</strong></p><p></p><p>#SPJ3</p><br />
