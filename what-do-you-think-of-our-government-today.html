                        corrupt and worse cause of the government not being able to manage the country very well, not being able to control the people, but on the bright side our country is getting better cause of the new buildings, and transportations being built and placed.<p>We, Filpinos, especially the supporters of Duterte, also known as dds, should realize that the Duterte administration is incompetent. They don’t have a plan for this pandemic since March when the pandemic started. President only thinks for vaccine, vaccine, vaccine. What if the vaccine won’t be successful until a year, 2 years, 3 years? What if the ingredients in making the vaccine are limited? In this time of pandemic, we need good governance. We need leadership. All the President can say are curse words. All he thinks are just PNP, AFP, Military. They don’t care about the health workers. Instead of funding for the dolomite sands, why not raise the salary of health workers who sacrifice their lives just to fight the virus. If only the President listened to Vice-President Leni Robredo last January to ban flights, maybe our country is COVID free.</p><p></p><p>The President must learn to step aside his pride for the sake of every Filipino. Last time, when the #CagayanNeedsHelp trended in Twitter, we saw VP Leni went there. She helps her fellow Filipinos and gave them food, essentials, etc., that came from donations. But the President talked about her for 20 minutes straight in his speech instead of talking for what’s really happened.</p><p></p><p>During the East Asian Summit, the President discussed his intentions to increased our disaster risk reduction management. How ironic it is to share his plans about increasing our disaster risk reduction management when he cut the funds for NDRRMC. The irony to discuss his intentions when he actively kills our own prevention efforts.</p><p></p><p>Let’s go back to the pandemic. Why did he appoint a retired general for the COVID task force? Why? As I’ve said earlier, he only thinks of PNP, AFP, Military. Why can’t he assign scientists, doctors? Can those retired general and his company kill the virus by shooting it? NO.  </p><p></p><p>Debold Sinas, who celebrated his birthday and conducted a mañanita in the middle of pandemic, is the newly appointed PNP Chief. Those things he had done are not allowed and you’ll be arrested. But what happened to him? The President appointed him as the new PNP Chief. He is free. The jeepney drivers, who are on their way to protest, has been arrested. Those who don’t have power are easily arrested, but what about those who have positions? They can go wherever they want. The justice in the Philippines is for those only who have power.</p><p></p><p>Let’s vote a good leader next election who cares about his people, who cares about poor, who cares about his nation. We need a leader not only who has a good heart, but also a brilliant mind. We need to vote a President who has dedication to his job.</p><p></p><p>#CarryOnLearning</p><br />
