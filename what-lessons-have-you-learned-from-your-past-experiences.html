This is also the time to wonder about your past experiences athome, school or community. For instance, you may reflect on the steps in problem solvingand decision-making that you have learned from school or remember the pieces of advicethat your parents and teachers gave you when you encountered a similar situation.2. Respond. Responding means acting on a situation while taking into consideration notonly on what is good for you but for others as well. To effectively respond with challenges,you need to plan your actions carefully. Weigh the possible effects of your decisions andreflect on your core values. Enjoy the process and develop a growth mindset to help yousucceed and overcome challenges.

                                            Keep in Mind Suggested Time Allotment: 15 minutes      Challenges are meant to motivate you and see what you are capable of doing. What's more, when you try to look back on those tough times, you can be truly proud of how you have overcome them using the most powerful weapon that you have your gained knowledge and skills.

The following are ways on how you can use and apply your academic and life lessons to deal future challenges:       3 Rs of Overcoming Life's Challenges through Gained Knowledge 1. Reflect. Reflection gives your mind an opportunity to pause and sort through your thoughts and feelings. This is also the time to wonder about your past experiences at home, school or community. For instance, you may reflect on the steps in problem solving and decision-making that you have learned from school or remember the pieces of advice that your parents and teachers gave you when you encountered a similar situation.2. Respond. Responding means acting on a situation while taking into consideration not only on what is good for you but for others as well. To effectively respond with challenges you need to plan your actions carefully. Weigh the possible effects of your decisions and reflect on your core values. Enjoy the process and develop a growth mindset to help you succeed and overcome challenges. As you go along, you will continuously learn, unlearn and re-learn which will empower you to apply your gained knowledge from one experience to another.3. Review. Reviewing helps in remembering the important information and key details of what you have learned. Learning is built on prior knowledge that's why in school, review is a very important part of the teaching and learning process. When done well, this gives you the opportunity to take what you have learned, make it your own, and apply it. More so, in your daily life, you can simply review and apply the knowledge and lessons that you have learned to any academic or personal challenges.​</a>

The Philippine government didn’t impose travel bans and stringent safety protocols fast enough to prevent the virus from entering the country, the slacking and inattentiveness of the government caused some massive consequences to the entire nation.Since the Philippines is only a developing country or a so-called third-world country, the government could not very much contain the effects of the deadly pandemic, imposing lockdowns and keeping people to go out of their houses and huddling together were not enough to prevent more than 8,500 people to perish within 8 months and a worldwide death or 2.1 million people.Note: Please do expound this position paper, I already provided the most important parts, you just have to add more to strengthen your position regarding the issue.Assesment:1.TRUE2.TRUE 3.TRUE4.TRUE5.FALSE6.TRUE7.FALSE8.TRUE9.TRUE10.TRUEII.1.a position paper presents one side of an arguable opinion about an issue.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Assessments, understood as tools for tracking what and how well students have learned, play a critical role in the classroom. Developing Assessments for the Next Generation Science Standards develops an approach to science assessment to meet the vision of science education for the future as it has been elaborated in A Framework for K-12 Science Education (Framework) and Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). These documents are brand new and the changes they call for are barely under way, but the new assessments will be needed as soon as states and districts begin the process of implementing the NGSS and changing their approach to science education.
</p><p>
</p><p>The new Framework and the NGSS are designed to guide educators in significantly altering the way K-12 science is taught. The Framework is aimed at making science education more closely resemble the way scientists actually work and think, and making instruction reflect research on learning that demonstrates the importance of building coherent understandings over time. It structures science education around three dimensions - the practices through which scientists and engineers do their work, the key crosscutting concepts that cut across disciplines, and the core ideas of the disciplines - and argues that they should be interwoven in every aspect of science education, building in sophistication as students progress through grades K-12.</p><br />

The Philippine government didn’t impose travel bans and stringent safety protocols fast enough to prevent the virus from entering the country, the slacking and inattentiveness of the government caused some massive consequences to the entire nation.Since the Philippines is only a developing country or a so-called third-world country, the government could not very much contain the effects of the deadly pandemic, imposing lockdowns and keeping people to go out of their houses and huddling together were not enough to prevent more than 8,500 people to perish within 8 months and a worldwide death or 2.1 million people.Note: Please do expound this position paper, I already provided the most important parts, you just have to add more to strengthen your position regarding the issue.Assesment:1.TRUE2.TRUE 3.TRUE4.TRUE5.FALSE6.TRUE7.FALSE8.TRUE9.TRUE10.TRUEII.1.a position paper presents one side of an arguable opinion about an issue.
