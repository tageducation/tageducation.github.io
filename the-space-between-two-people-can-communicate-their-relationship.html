                        <p>The answer is <strong>True</strong>. </p><p><strong>How do we use space to communicate with others? </strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>We usually use:</strong></p><p>1. <strong>Space</strong> - to communicate the status as a size or location of our home. </p><p>2. <strong>Relationships</strong> - to know who's important to you or not</p><p>3. <strong>Territory</strong> - what do I consider as mine? </p><p></p><p><strong>Space</strong> also indicates the <strong>Nonverbal Communication. </strong></p>The Communication that occurs separate from spoken words is called non-verbal communication.<p></p>For example, a person is standing at the hallway while you are walking towards the classroom and you <strong>waved</strong>. They aren't saying anything, but still, they are clearly sending and receiving information back and forth about their feelings and attitudes. <p></p>The <strong>rolling of the eyes, a hug, sitting alone at a table</strong> - all of these actions communicate non-verbally something about yourself, something you expect the rest of the world to be able to understand. However, there are several ways to communicate without words. Many of them involve your interaction with physical space. As the saying goes, "actions really do speak louder than words."<p></p><p><strong>Physical Space &amp; Nonverbal Communication</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p>One of the basic ideas in communication is immediacy, or the ways that we communicate openness, friendliness, and a desire or willingness to communicate with others.<p></p><p><strong>Common nonverbal signals</strong> of immediacy include things like smiling and waving, but this also extends to your use of physical space.</p><p></p><p>This kind of communication is also known as <strong>Proxemics</strong>. </p><p></p><p><strong>What is Proxemics?</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p>It is the study of human use of space and the effects that population density has on behaviour, communication, and social interaction<p></p><p><strong>The use of space varies in culture:</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p> If you’re in a western culture like in the US and your friend is from Latin America. You may feel a little bit uncomfortable when your friend stands a little closer to you when you would like. You may feel that he/she’s encroaching on your personal space. <p></p>For men, men usually have more space as a limit and yes culture refers to more than race or ethnicity.<p></p>If you’re working with someone, you may probably reduce the amount of space, in order for the others to see your screen.<p></p>For photos, you may notice the photographers asking to stand closer and act like you like each other. It depends on the individuality and their individual preferences. <p></p><p><strong>This can be applied across cultures:</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p>The distance between the communicators can help us see their relationship to each other.  The behaviour tends to be learned implicitly by observing other. Less likely to explicitly instruct others as what appropriate distance is when we communicate to each other. <p></p><p>There's also a type of non-verbal communication called <strong>Territoriality</strong>.</p><p></p><p><strong>What is Territoriality?</strong></p> It is a  non verbal communication of ownership. Feeling protective of a specific physical space and your body language reflects on it. <p></p><p><strong>4 types of Territoriality:</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p>1. <strong>Body Territory</strong> - it refers to a personal space or bubble we keep to ourselves. You can carry around you anywhere you like. </p><p></p><p>2. <strong>Primary/Home Territory</strong>  - it is the location where you feel comfortable and will feel violated if someone you don't know enters to this space. You can do whatever you want. </p><p></p><p>3. <strong>Secondary Territory</strong> - it is an interactional space where the same people go on consistency level. You can view it as yours but you will expect to see others such as colleagues, schoolmates, teachers and many more. </p><p></p><p>4. <strong>Public Territory-</strong> This is open to everyone and accessible. Samples are  park, cinema, mall. You'll usually use territorial marker such as using objects or bodies to mark it as your own. </p><p></p><p><strong>Different types of Territorial Markers. </strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p>1. <strong>Central markers</strong>- used to identify our personal space. </p><p></p><p><strong>Example:</strong> </p><p>You arrived early in your classroom. You may save your space by putting ur backpack on the table or chair or use of hand to indicate that it is taken or saved for someone else. </p><p></p><p>2. <strong>Boundary markers</strong> - boundaries of territory with physical barrier such as fence, closed door and gates. </p><p></p><p>3.<strong> Earmarks</strong> - uses objects to identify that it’s yours. </p><p></p><p><strong>Example: </strong></p><p>Putting a Keep out of Private property sign</p><p>Labelling your lunch bag.</p><p></p><p><strong>Here are some helpful articles you can use to learn more about space and non verbal communication: </strong></p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/1515032</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/854588</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/1722308</p><br />
