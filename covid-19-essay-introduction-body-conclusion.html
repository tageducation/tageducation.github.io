                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Community Pantries in Philippines</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Community Pantries in the Philippines</p><p></p><p>In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, Filipinos are demonstrating their "bayanihan" spirit by establishing community pantries. The community pantry is a grassroots initiative that provides food and other essential items to those in need. It began with a small group of volunteers in Quezon City, but it quickly spread throughout the country, with thousands of community pantries popping up in various cities and municipalities.</p><p></p><p>The community pantry movement has gained momentum due to the government's slow response to the pandemic. Filipinos who have lost their jobs or livelihoods due to lockdowns and quarantines have been struggling to put food on the table. The community pantries provide them with much-needed assistance. The pantries rely on donations from individuals, groups, and even businesses, and the items are available to anyone who needs them. The community pantry movement has become a symbol of hope and solidarity during these challenging times.</p><p></p><p>Despite its success, the community pantry movement has faced challenges, including red-tagging, where organizers and volunteers are accused of being communist sympathizers. The government has also expressed concerns about the unregulated distribution of goods and the potential for crowds to gather, which could spread the virus. Despite these challenges, the community pantry movement continues to thrive and provide aid to those in need.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the community pantry movement is a remarkable display of the Filipino spirit of bayanihan. It highlights the importance of community solidarity and demonstrates the power of people coming together to help those in need. Despite facing challenges, the community pantries have become a beacon of hope and a symbol of resilience in these difficult times.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>.yan po pa brainliest </p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>As we are writing this essay, The Coronavirus outbreak known as Covid-19 has so far killed over 388,041 people across the globe and infected 6,573,585 (as on June 3, 2020). Although this virus can infect people of all ages, people over 60 years old and those with underlying medical conditions are at higher risk of getting infected. As Corona Pandemic is one the worst pandemics of the decade we have prepared an “Essay on Coronavirus” for students of various standards.</p><p></p><p>Global Corona pandemic describes an infectious disease (COVID-19) by a large family of viruses known as the corona. World Health Organization (WHO) and it’s communication with the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) announced the official name for this new virus responsible for the disease is SARS-CoV-2 on 11th February 2020. The full form of this virus is Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona virus 2.</p><p></p><p>There are several reports of the origin of this virus but the most accepted report is the following one. The origin of this disease is well fixed at the world-famous Huanan seafood market in Wuhan during late 2019 in which a person was infected with a virus from a mammal; Pangolin. As reported, pangolins were not listed for sale in Wuhan and it is illegal to sell them. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) also says that pangolins are the most illegally traded mammal in the world. One statistical study provides that pangolins are able to develop the characteristics that the newly found virus enables. Later it was reported that a descendent of the virus came into effect with humans and then espoused as it was preceded from human to human. </p><p></p><p>the disease is continuing its spread across the world. It is noted that possible animal sources of COVID-19 have not yet been confirmed. It can spread only from person to person through small (respiratory) droplets from the nose, mouth or coughing and sneezing. These droplets land on any object or surfaces. </p><p></p><br />

The COVID-19 pandemic, while draws the world’s attention to the vaccine, also reminds us of the importance of immunization, which saves millions of lives each year.</p><p></p><p>WHO is working with partners all over the world to accelerate research and development of a safe and effective vaccine and ensure equitable access for the billions of people who will need it. But even with an expedited process, development of a vaccine for COVID-19 will take time. </p><p></p><p>The ongoing pandemic disrupts routine immunization services in many countries. When immunization services are disrupted, even for brief periods during emergencies, the risk of vaccine-preventable disease outbreaks, such as measles and polio, increase. Further disease outbreaks will also overwhelm health systems already battling the impacts of COVID-19.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>COVID-19 vaccines were evaluated in clinical trials and have been approved because those studies show that the vaccine significantly reduces the probability of contracting the virus.</p><p></p><p>Based on what has been proved about vaccines for other diseases, the COVID-19 vaccine may help keep you from getting seriously ill, even if you do get the virus. Getting vaccinated also may protect people around you — particularly those at greater risk for severe illness from COVID-19.</p><p></p><p>Saag says the true value of the vaccine is more easily seen when we consider what would happen if the development of a vaccine had failed.</p><p></p><p>“We would be faced with an exploding pandemic for which there was no end in sight,” Saag said. “It might continue to burn through the population for another two to four years.”</p><p></p><p>He compares the rapid development of a safe, highly effective vaccine to both a “home run” and an event that might be seen as divine intervention.</p><p></p><p>“First, scientists developed the strategy and drug quickly,” Saag explained. “Second, the resulting vaccine works at an almost unprecedented level of effectiveness. Third, the side-effect profile is the same as for most vaccines. You may get aches and fever that are gone in 36 hours, on average. So, this is a walk-off, grand-slam home run in the last game of the World Series that you rarely witness in medicine.”</p><br />
