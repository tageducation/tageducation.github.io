                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>D. The test was a 50-item test</p><p><strong>Step-by-step explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p>→ He scored above 75% of his classmates, NOT 25%. Therefore A is not the right answer.</p><p></p><p>→ He passed the test because the 75th percentile is equivalent to 3rd or upper quartile.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>C:she surpassed 75%of her classmates</p><p></p><p><strong>Step-by-step explanation:</strong></p><p>So we're given that somebody scored a 50 out of a 70 item test and that's in the third corps tile and we want to know what does it mean when something is in the third quartile. So if we're in the third quartile, you can think about quarters as being divided into four sections. So this would be quartile one To, this would be the third quartile and the 4th quartile over here. I guess I should change that to Roman numeral. So if something is in the third quartile it is at 75%. So that number would be right here And there would be 75% of the data. That would be less than that number. So the correct statement when we're thinking about Um what it means if she scored in the third quartile, it means that she surpassed 75% of the classmates or the other test takers.</p><p></p><br />
