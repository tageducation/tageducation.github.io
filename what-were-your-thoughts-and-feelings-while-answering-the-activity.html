At the end, I will help them solve whatever conflict they have.</p><p>-When I made an unpopular decision, I just neglect the bad feedbacks because it will not change the situation. I just focused on how to divert and make the situation better rather than thinking negatively.</p><p>-Yes, I can make decisions alone especially if the situation is manageable. However, their are some things beyond expectation in which I really have to call for help and teamwork is really a must.</p><p>-Yes, I often make the most decisions because I have the courage and determination. I believe in my own self and in my own capacity.</p><p>-The pandemic we are facing today is very alarming but it is not a way to stop living. In fact, It gives us more courage to endure the consequences. Working despite the danger of the pandemic is one example of our strength.
