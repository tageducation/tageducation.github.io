                        Answer:<p></p><p>1.During the intake stroke, the fuel and air mixture is drawn into the cylinder with the exhaust valve closed. Then the air and fuel mixture is compressed in a compression stroke. ... During the expansion or power stroke, the high-pressure combustion gases expand moving the piston down and delivering the power.</p><p></p><p>2.Compression Stroke</p><p>During the compression, no heat is transferred to the fuel/air mixture. As the volume is decreased because of the piston's motion, the pressure in the gas is increased, as described by the laws of thermodynamics.</p><p></p><p>3.The main purpose of the spark plug is to ignite the air and fuel mixture inside a combustion chamber. To produce fire or flame, there has to be oxygen, fuel and ignition. The spark plug then causes the mixture to produce flame thus increasing the mixture temperature.</p><p></p><p>4.By definition, power stroke is the stage in an internal combustion engine cycle wherein the expansion of gases causes the piston to move outwards.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Q17.What happens to the gas if it is heated inside the engine's cylinder?<p>When the gases are heated inside the engines cylinder, it results into high temperature and pressure due to vibration cause by movement of gas particles. Increase in tempearture and pressure produces internal combustion that direct force to component of the engines including pistons, turbine blades and rotor.</p>Q18.What happens to the piston and the gases during the compression stroke?<p>Compression Stroke</p><p>During the compression, no heat is transferred to the fuel/air mixture. As the volume is decreased because of the piston's motion, the pressure in the gas is increased, as described by the laws of thermodynamics.</p>Q19.What is the function of the spark plug?<p>Your spark plugs are what supply the spark that ignites the air/fuel mixture, creating the explosion which makes your engine produce power. These small but simple plugs create an arc of electricity across two leads which are not touching, but close enough together that electricity can jump the gap between them.</p>Q20. Describe the piston and the gases during power stroke<p>The high pressure of the gases acting on the face of the piston cause the piston to move to the left which initiates the power stroke. ... During the power stroke, the volume occupied by the gases is increased because of the piston motion and no heat is transferred to the fuel/air mixture.</p>Q21. In exhaust stroke, what happens to the piston and the mixture of gases ?<p>During the exhaust stroke, the mixture of gases that were ignited during the compression/power/expansion stroke is forced out from the cylinder through the exhaust valve. The piston, meanwhile, rises to force the gases out.</p>Q22.What do you think is the effect of this exhaust gas to the environment?<p>Air pollutants are responsible for a number of adverse environmental effects, such as photochemical smog, acid rain, death of forests, or reduced atmospheric visibility. Emissions of greenhouse gases from combustion of fossil fuels are associated with the global warming of Earth's climate.</p>Q23. Can we consider heat engine 100%efficient? Why or why not?<p>No. 100 percent efficient engine is not possible. In reality, heat engines are inefficient systems. ... Another is that not all thermal energy is used by the system, some of it exits the engine as heat, which is not used to produce the force or output that is needed.</p>Q 24. As a student, how can you help minimize the effects of thermal pollution?<p>Thermal pollution is the degradation of water quality due to changes in water temperature. A change in water quality affects oxygen supply and the ecosystem that is dependent on bodies of water. There are different factors why water temperature changes and one of these is due to the heat released by power plants.</p><p>As a student, there are only limited things that I can do to minimize the effects of thermal pollution:</p>Plant trees. By planting trees, it helps minimize the degradation of water temperature by blocking the sun's heat and absorbing carbon emissions. By absorbing carbon emissions, more oxygen is provided for the water.Reduce electrical consumption. Power plants are the major contributor of thermal pollution and by consuming less power, less power is also managed by the power plants. With less power, less water will be used as a coolant wherein it would lessen the heated water being sent back to where it came from.  <p>In the end, there are only a handful of ways that I can do as a student to help solve thermal pollution. The best way is to educate other people of the effects of thermal pollution in order to have a collective effort in providing a solution to the problem. Take note that what we do will always have a domino effect on our environment therefore, we should do things accordingly.</p><br />

Any energy unit can be used for heat transfer, and the most common are kilocalorie (kcal) and joule (J). Kilocalorie is defined to be the energy needed to change the temperature of 1.00 kg of water between 14.5ºC and 15.5ºC.</p><p></p><p>12.)In thermodynamics and engineering, a heat engine is a system that converts heat to mechanical energy, which can then be used to do mechanical work. It does this by bringing a working substance from a higher state temperature to a lower state temperature.</p><p></p><p>13.)A heat engine is considered to be 100% efficient if only all the heat is converted into useful work or mechanical energy. Since heat engines cannot convert all the heat energy into mechanical energy, their efficiency can never be 100%.</p><p></p><p>14.)Simply put, thermal pollution comes from hot water or cold water being dumped into a body of water. Bodies of water naturally tend to dissipate the heat gained from warm currents, underwater hot springs, and from the sun.</p><p></p><p>15.)The air then flows over a heating element (similar to the one in a fan heater). On a cold day, this part of the unit may be turned right up so the HVAC works as a heater. ... As it does so, it picks up heat from the air blowing past the pipes and evaporates, turning from a cool liquid into a hotter gas.</p><p></p><p>16.)Heat Engines are any device that converts thermal energy into mechanical energy/work. Chemical energy in fuel transformed into thermal energy then some of the thermal energy transformed into mechanical energy. This process explains how an internal combustion engine works.</p><p></p><p>17.)According to the second law of thermodynamics, however, it cannot convert *all* of the heat energy supplied to it into work. Basic heat engine: hot reservoir, cold reservoir, and a machine to convert heat energy into work. This is a simplified diagram of a heat engine, along with its thermal cycle.</p><p></p><p>18.) (the end of the compression stroke) the compressed air-fuel mixture is ignited by a spark plug (in a gasoline engine) or by heat generated by high compression (diesel engines), forcefully returning the piston to B.D.C. This stroke produces mechanical work from the engine to turn the crankshaft.</p><p></p><p>19.)The great advantage of using a heat pump to keep your home warm, rather than just burning fuel, is that a heat pump supplies Qh = Qc + W. Heat transfer is from the outside air, even at a temperature below freezing, to the indoor space. You only pay for W, and you get an additional heat transfer of Qc from the outside at no cost; in many cases, at least twice as much energy is transferred to the heated space as is used to run the heat pump. When you burn fuel to keep warm, you pay for all of it. The disadvantage is that the work input (required by the second law of thermodynamics) is sometimes more expensive than simply burning fuel, especially if the work is done by electrical energy.</p><p></p><p>20.)The statement that thermal pollution is brought about by the accumulated exhaustion of heat from diesel, gasoline and industrial engines is indeed correct. ...

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>1. What happens to the gas if it is heated inside the engine's cylinder?<p>When the gases are heated inside the engines cylinder, it results into high temperature and pressure due to vibration cause by movement of gas particles. Increase in tempearture and pressure produces internal combustion that direct force to component of the engines including pistons, turbine blades and rotor.</p>2. What happens to the piston and the gases during the compression stroke?<p>Compression Stroke</p><p>During the compression, no heat is transferred to the fuel/air mixture. As the volume is decreased because of the piston's motion, the pressure in the gas is increased, as described by the laws of thermodynamics.</p>3. What is the function of the spark plug?<p>Your spark plugs are what supply the spark that ignites the air/fuel mixture, creating the explosion which makes your engine produce power. These small but simple plugs create an arc of electricity across two leads which are not touching, but close enough together that electricity can jump the gap between them.</p>4. Describe the piston and the gases during power stroke<p>The high pressure of the gases acting on the face of the piston cause the piston to move to the left which initiates the power stroke. ... During the power stroke, the volume occupied by the gases is increased because of the piston motion and no heat is transferred to the fuel/air mixture.</p>5. In exhaust stroke, what happens to the piston and the mixture of gases ?<p>During the exhaust stroke, the mixture of gases that were ignited during the compression/power/expansion stroke is forced out from the cylinder through the exhaust valve. The piston, meanwhile, rises to force the gases out.</p>6.What do you think is the effect of this exhaust gas to the environment?<p>Air pollutants are responsible for a number of adverse environmental effects, such as photochemical smog, acid rain, death of forests, or reduced atmospheric visibility. Emissions of greenhouse gases from combustion of fossil fuels are associated with the global warming of Earth's climate.</p>7. Can we consider heat engine 100%efficient? Why or why not?<p>No. 100 percent efficient engine is not possible. In reality, heat engines are inefficient systems. ... Another is that not all thermal energy is used by the system, some of it exits the engine as heat, which is not used to produce the force or output that is needed..</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>What does a heat engine do?

<p><strong>Heat engines convert thermal energy into mechanical energy, so the answer is the letter (b).
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong>Heat engines</strong> generally work by using a rotating shaft that uses excess heat from a source such as a furnace in the old days and converting a bit of that heat into movement or work, the same process is in use today even with solar panels as a heat source.  </p><p>
</p><p>Being dependent on<strong> cycles,</strong> heat engines need some sort of fluid<strong> (working fluid)</strong> to continue functioning.  </p><p>It all starts with a heat source, where the heat generated will be absorbed by the fluid, converting itself into steam using a type of boiler. The expanded steam turns the shaft which is almost always a turbine of some sort. The spinning shaft operates the engine and work is created.  </p><p>
</p><p>To complete the cycle mentioned earlier, excess heat (steam) that was not converted to work goes into the condenser which turns it back into fluid. This fluid is then pumped back into the boiler and reused.  </p><p>

                         ANSWER <p></p><p>1.When the gases are heated inside the engines cylinder, it results into high temperature and pressure due to vibration cause by movement of gas particles. Increase in tempearture and pressure produces internal combustion that direct force to component of the engines including pistons, turbine blades and rotor.</p><p></p><p>2.When compressing a gas using a cylinder and a piston, the piston is being pushed up and down. As the piston goes down, the gas inside the cylinder is being compressed; raising its temperature and decreasing its volume. ... The compression stroke is being done in 4-stroke engine.</p><p></p><p>3.The main purpose of the spark plug is to ignite the air and fuel mixture inside a combustion chamber. To produce fire or flame, there has to be oxygen, fuel and ignition. The spark plug then causes the mixture to produce flame thus increasing the mixture temperature.</p><p></p><p>4.By definition, power stroke is the stage in an internal combustion engine cycle wherein the expansion of gases causes the piston to move outwards. The hot expanding gases causes the piston to move away from the cylinder head. The piston movement then results to further movement of the connecting rod then applying torque to the crankshaft. The torque applied results to.crankshaft rotation. Furthermore, the amount of torque produced is depemdent upon the size of the piston, the pressure on the piston caused by the gases, and the throw of the engine.</p><p></p><p><strong>-SORRY </strong><strong>DI </strong><strong>KO </strong><strong>MAPA </strong><strong>IKSI</strong></p><p><strong>-BRAINIEST </strong><strong>AND </strong><strong>HEART </strong><strong>PLS</strong></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>In thermodynamics and engineering, a heat engine is a system that converts heat to mechanical energy, which can then be used to do mechanical work. It does this by bringing a working substance from a higher state temperature to a lower state temperature</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>sana po makatulong</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Internal combustion engines are the most common form of heat engines, as they are used in vehicles, boats, ships, airplanes, and trains. They are named as such because the fuel is ignited in order to do work inside the engine. The same fuel and air mixture is then emitted as exhaust. In thermodynamics and engineering, a heat engine is a system that converts heat to mechanical energy, which can then be used to do mechanical work. It does this by bringing a working substance from a higher state temperature to a lower state temperature.</p><br />

What is the function of the spark plug? What is its effect to the mixture's temperature?4. In exhaust stroke, what happens to the piston and the mixture of gases?5. What do you think is the effect of this exhaust gas to the environment?6. Can we consider heat engine 100% efficient? Why? Why not?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. The engine consists of a fixed cylinder and a moving piston. The expanding combustion gases push the piston, which in turn rotates the crankshaft. ... After the piston compresses the fuel-air mixture, the spark ignites it, causing combustion. The expansion of the combustion gases pushes the piston during the power stroke</p><p></p><p>2.When compressing a gas using a cylinder and a piston, the piston is being pushed up and down. As the piston goes down, the gas inside the cylinder is being compressed; raising its temperature and decreasing its volume. ... These strokes includes the intake, compression, power, and exhaust</p><p></p><p>3.The main purpose of the spark plug is to ignite the air and fuel mixture inside a combustion chamber. To produce fire or flame, there has to be oxygen, fuel and ignition. The spark plug then causes the mixture to produce flame thus increasing the mixture temperature.</p><p></p><p>4. During the exhaust stroke, the mixture of gases that were ignited during the compression/power/expansion stroke is forced out from the cylinder through the exhaust valve. The piston, meanwhile, rises to force the gases out.</p><p></p><p>5. It is produced from the combustion of gasoline, natural gas, fuel oil, diesel oil, petrol, or coal. ... Here are the effects of exhaust gas in the environment: Acid rain. Global warming.</p><p></p><p>6. No. 100 percent efficient engine is not possible. In reality, heat engines are inefficient systems. ... Another is that not all thermal energy is used by the system, some of it exits the engine as heat, which is not used to produce the force or output that is needed.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />
