won’t you tell me how it’s supposed to be?
Who is it that I see who’s there inside of me?
I can’t be anything but broken,
broken on this earth
And you don’t see a thing, just laugh for all your worth
I’m already all broken down,
and my breath starts to seize
I pull, but it won’t come apart and you can see the truth freeze
Breaking apart, but I can’t drop
I’m going mad, my mind can’t stop
Then finding you made something pop
This world is so twisted and tangled around me,
I’m drifting and fading until you can’t see
Please, just leave me lost; no, don’t look back at me. No, don’t look at me
I never chose this world that someone decreed
I just wanted you to be safe here from me
Just keep me in mind; the way I used to be, when I shone vividly
The solitude creeping around in strands until I’m weighted down,
Remembering in innocence my laughter in the distance
I can’t get free no, can’t get free; no, can’t get free, no can’t get free no, can’t get free, no, can’t get free
it’s unravelling the world
My life here was stifled,
But somehow changed forever
The two of us are joined, but might die when we’re together
Breaking apart, but I can’t drop
I’m going mad, my mind can’t stop
You won’t be a blemished prop
This world is so twisted and tangled around me,
I’m drifting and fading until you can’t see
Please, just leave me lost; no, don’t look back at me. No, don’t look at me
In this lonely trap someone built I can’t be free
Before all the future unravels ’round me
Just keep me in mind the way I used to be, when I shone vividly
Oh, don’t forget me
please, don’t forget me
please, don’t forget me
please, don’t forget me
The fact that I’ve changed somehow leaves me paralyzed,
In this world I can’t control, this stranger’s paradise
Just keep me in mind yes, please remember me.
Oh, won’t you say
oh, won’t you say
oh, won’t you say
who’s there inside of me?</a>

He looked up and saw a big beehive. “Look how big the beehive is!” thought the bear. «There must be a honey in it. Anyway, the bees are small, and would not do me harm if I take the honey”. As he hit the beehive, a swarm of bees flew out. Some stung his ears, others stung his eyes, some his hands and a few stung his whole body. The bear screamed and ran away into the forest.

                            17. Oh, won’t you tell me,
won’t you tell me how it’s supposed to be?
Who is it that I see who’s there inside of me?
I can’t be anything but broken,
broken on this earth
And you don’t see a thing, just laugh for all your worth
I’m already all broken down,
and my breath starts to seize
I pull, but it won’t come apart and you can see the truth freeze
Breaking apart, but I can’t drop
I’m going mad, my mind can’t stop
Then finding you made something pop
This world is so twisted and tangled around me,
I’m drifting and fading until you can’t see
Please, just leave me lost; no, don’t look back at me. No, don’t look at me
I never chose this world that someone decreed
I just wanted you to be safe here from me
Just keep me in mind; the way I used to be, when I shone vividly
The solitude creeping around in strands until I’m weighted down,
Remembering in innocence my laughter in the distance
I can’t get free no, can’t get free; no, can’t get free, no can’t get free no, can’t get free, no, can’t get free
it’s unravelling the world
My life here was stifled,
But somehow changed forever
The two of us are joined, but might die when we’re together
Breaking apart, but I can’t drop
I’m going mad, my mind can’t stop
You won’t be a blemished prop
This world is so twisted and tangled around me,
I’m drifting and fading until you can’t see
Please, just leave me lost; no, don’t look back at me. No, don’t look at me
In this lonely trap someone built I can’t be free
Before all the future unravels ’round me
Just keep me in mind the way I used to be, when I shone vividly
Oh, don’t forget me
please, don’t forget me
please, don’t forget me
please, don’t forget me
The fact that I’ve changed somehow leaves me paralyzed,
In this world I can’t control, this stranger’s paradise
Just keep me in mind yes, please remember me.
Oh, won’t you say
oh, won’t you say
oh, won’t you say
who’s there inside of me?</h2><br />

He looked up and saw a big beehive. “Look how big the beehive is!” thought the bear. «There must be a honey in it. Anyway, the bees are small, and would not do me harm if I take the honey”. As he hit the beehive, a swarm of bees flew out. Some stung his ears, others stung his eyes, some his hands and a few stung his whole body. The bear screamed and ran away into the forest.
