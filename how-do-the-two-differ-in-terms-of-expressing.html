Which of the two has better vocal quality and voice range?4. Which rendition portrays better intonation, diction and enunciation?​</h2><br />
                        1. The two differ in terms of expressing emotions portrayed in the song through:<p>With<strong> their singing styles</strong>, the two performances conveyed various emotions. The procedure used by Vanya is more breathy and feels gentler. The technique used by Daryl is a richer voice with more intense passion.</p><p></p>2. I think which rendition is more relevant and charismatic are:<p><strong>Daryl Ong's </strong>interpretation, in my opinion, is superior because I was more moved by his emotion and because I enjoyed the music he chose. Both are excellent, but I prefer how Daryl modifies parts of the song's tones to make it more charismatic.</p><p></p>3. I think which of the two has the better vocal quality and voice range are:<p>I can tell that <strong>Daryl Ong</strong> has a stronger vocal quality and voice range based on their cover. Daryl's use of his entire voice and less falsetto demonstrates just how skilled he is. Vanya is adept at transitioning between high and low notes, yet she is only a little too breathy.</p><p></p>4. I think which rendition portrays better intonation, diction, and enunciation are:<p>Both of these have good intonation, but I prefer <strong>Daryl Ong</strong>'s more. He changes his tone, which is an excellent way to introduce <strong>something fresh</strong>. Daryl also wins for clarity of speech and enunciation because his singing voice is louder than Vanya's. The language on Daryl's cover is clear to me.</p><p></p>Further explanation:<p>Filipino singer-songwriter Daryl Neilsonn Ong is from the country. He became well-known after competing in <strong>The Voice of the Philippines</strong>, a singing contest. The judges and Filipino viewers were charmed with Ong's performance of "Paano" during his blind audition for Season 2 of The Voice of the Philippines.</p><p></p><p>With such a smooth and polished voice, Daryl is an R&amp;B powerhouse. He does not casually imitate known icons' modal runs like the majority of R&amp;B artists do. He uses melisma and humorous melodic alterations just when necessary to fit the song's new style, demonstrating his skill and accuracy in doing so. This is what gives his song revivals their strength and allure. He expertly and commandingly reworks any piece of music.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Learn more about Filipino music here: https://brainly.ph/question/3612232#</strong></p><p></p><p>#SPJ2</p><br />
