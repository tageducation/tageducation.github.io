                                            Directions: The election does not contain a topic sentence; hence you need to understand the selection to infer its main idea. What can a hug do? It delights. It comforts. It thrills. Who doesn't want a warmth of a loving hug? Just like words, hugs speak volumes. They can mean "I miss you," "Bye," "I care," "1 love you." "It's OK," "I forgive," "I'm so proud of you!" In victory celebrations, in trying times, or in hours of bereavement, kiss is not the need of the hour. It is the hug that matters most.. A hug costs nothing. But it is a great gift to give on any occasion. No need to shop for it or bother about size or length or width. All you need is to open your arms wide and wrap the person inside them. And no matter how long or how short your arms are, hugs are always a perfect fit. And what so nice about giving a hug? You can get one in return. A hug goes beyond physical contact. It encompasses compassion, love, forgiveness, and care. "A hug delights and warms, and charms that must be why God gave us arms," so goes the quotation. So with arms wide open, why not go out and hug someone today? But first, here's my big, big, hug.

                                            Why Houseplants are the Perfect Valentine's Day Gift
The Beatles sang “money can’t buy me love” but do you think they’d say the same thing about
houseplants and love?
If your partner or crush is a lover of all things green and leafy, then we bet they’d be thrilled
with getting a houseplant for Valentine’s Day. And even if they’re not a convert yet, now is a
good time to get them hooked to the plant gene. It’s early spring for most of us, and this is the
perfect time to bring a new houseplant home.
Sure, you can always default to red roses for a grand Valentine’s Day gesture, but let us try to
change your mind. Here's why houseplants make for much better gifts than cut flowers, plus
a few ideas of low-maintenance and romantic houseplants to get you started!
1.Houseplants last longer
Ok, this is obvious. But we’re trying to slowly ease into advocating for houseplants. The
average life of a bouquet of cut flowers is about a week. Some bouquets come with plant feed
that might stretch that to ten days. After that, it’s bye-bye flowers!
Houseplants last much longer. Even the blackest of thumbs can’t manage to kill a plant in a
week (don’t take that as a challenge though!). Houseplants may last for years as a good
reminder for a thoughtful Valentine’s Day gift.
2. Houseplants are often cheaper
We bet this one is not so obvious, right? You may think of houseplants as an investment. And
some of them are (especially rare specimens). But you can easily find houseplants that cost
10 dollars, and we’re not talking about runts. Prices are going down as the popularity of
houseplants is going up, so even a trip to your local plant nursery won’t break the bank.
3. Houseplants are more environmentally friendly
Most people don’t realize the environmental footprint of the fresh flower industry. That’s
because we tend to associate flowers with nature, and nature can do no wrong, right?
What I Can Do
21
Well, not until it’s exploited for profit at a massive scale. Most cut flowers are grown year-round
in greenhouses and fields heavily laden with pesticides. In the United States, most fresh
flowersare imported. And because the flowers are already cut (so pretty much dead), they are
shipped long distances in refrigerated containers that take a lot of energy to stay cool.
There is also a lot of waste in the flower industry because we all want perfect-looking flowers
with zero blemishes. And not to mention the waste caused by the flowers being thrown away
en-masse if the supermarket can’t sell them within the short window when they look nice and
perky. We’re not saying that houseplants have a zero-carbon footprint. But they are definitely
the more responsible choice for eco-conscious Valentines.
4. Houseplants send a message
Now that we got the practical reasons out of the way, let’s talk a bit about the sentimental
symbolism. When you give someone a houseplant, the underlying message is this: I think
you’re a responsible person. I think you can nurture and take care of something. And you can
count on me because I’ll be around to help. Maybe in not so many words. But the sentiment
is there!
If your partner is already someone who loves houseplants, then offering them another plant
for their collection shows that you care about their interests and hobbies. And you get extra
bonus points for being a good listener if they’ve already hinted that they wouldn’t mind another
green friend, and you deliver.

                                            Who’s the Thief?" by Mendy Kaminker Three angry men presented themselves in King Solomon’s court. “Your Majesty,” said the first, “the three of us are business partners. We went together on a business trip with a large sum of money.” The second picked up the story. “Shortly before Shabbat, we hid the money in a pit we’d dug, planning to dig it up right after Shabbat.” King Solomon listened attentively. It was gone! “But when we went for it, it was gone!” said the third. “No one knew about it but us. One of us is a thief! My lord, I’d like for you to have each of us swear that he didn’t steal the money. That way we’ll find out which of us is the thief!” But King Solomon was in no hurry to do that. He knew that the man who stole the money would also lie and swear falsely. How could he find out which of them was guilty? “Return to me tomorrow,” he told the three. When the partners presented themselves the next day, King Solomon said, “I can see that you three are wise men. Before we discuss your case, I would like your opinion about a different matter.” King Solomon’s flattery worked like magic, and they waited eagerly to hear his problem. “A boy and a girl grew up together, and swore to each other that when they were old enough, they would become husband and wife. At very least, they decided, they’d ask the other’s permission before marrying anyone else. “Years passed. The girl, forgetting her oath, married someone else. Immediately after the wedding, she remembered her earlier commitment and told her husband about it. He said, ‘We can’t live as husband and wife until we find that boy and ask him to annul the oath that you swore to each other!’ “They took a large sum of money and set out to find her childhood friend. They found him and offered to pay him to annul the oath, but he was a good man, so he wished them a hearty mazal tov and refused the money. “On their way home, the happy new couple was robbed. ‘Please give us back the money,’ the woman pleaded. She told the robber about how good her husband was, being so patient as to let her take care of her oath before they moved in together, and how good the boy she’d grown up with was for refusing to take the money. The robber was touched, and returned the purse.” King Solomon looked at the three men, who couldn’t understand where all this was leading. “My question is, which of the people in this story was the most praiseworthy?” asked the king. One of the partners said, “The wife is the most admirable. She kept an oath she made when she was just a girl!” The second partner said, “Her husband is the most praiseworthy. Although he loved his wife, he left home right after his wedding to find that boy, and allowed himself to act as a husband to her only after she was released from her oath.” The last partner said, “Its true, both of them behaved in an exemplary fashion. But the boy was a fool! Why didn’t he take the money when they offered it to him?” “You are the thief!” “You are the thief!” King Solomon bellowed, pointing to the last partner. “When you talk that way about the boy, you show that you have an appetite for money even if you have no right to it. I’m convinced that you stole the money from your partners.” The last partner admitted his guilt, and the other two went home satisfied and impressed by the wisdom of King Solomon1.

                            10. Directions: The election does not contain a topic sentence; hence you need to understand the selection to infer its main idea. What can a hug do? It delights. It comforts. It thrills. Who doesn't want a warmth of a loving hug? Just like words, hugs speak volumes. They can mean "I miss you," "Bye," "I care," "1 love you." "It's OK," "I forgive," "I'm so proud of you!" In victory celebrations, in trying times, or in hours of bereavement, kiss is not the need of the hour. It is the hug that matters most.. A hug costs nothing. But it is a great gift to give on any occasion. No need to shop for it or bother about size or length or width. All you need is to open your arms wide and wrap the person inside them. And no matter how long or how short your arms are, hugs are always a perfect fit. And what so nice about giving a hug? You can get one in return. A hug goes beyond physical contact. It encompasses compassion, love, forgiveness, and care. "A hug delights and warms, and charms that must be why God gave us arms," so goes the quotation. So with arms wide open, why not go out and hug someone today? But first, here's my big, big, hug.

                            14. Why Houseplants are the Perfect Valentine's Day Gift
The Beatles sang “money can’t buy me love” but do you think they’d say the same thing about
houseplants and love?
If your partner or crush is a lover of all things green and leafy, then we bet they’d be thrilled
with getting a houseplant for Valentine’s Day. And even if they’re not a convert yet, now is a
good time to get them hooked to the plant gene. It’s early spring for most of us, and this is the
perfect time to bring a new houseplant home.
Sure, you can always default to red roses for a grand Valentine’s Day gesture, but let us try to
change your mind. Here's why houseplants make for much better gifts than cut flowers, plus
a few ideas of low-maintenance and romantic houseplants to get you started!
1.Houseplants last longer
Ok, this is obvious. But we’re trying to slowly ease into advocating for houseplants. The
average life of a bouquet of cut flowers is about a week. Some bouquets come with plant feed
that might stretch that to ten days. After that, it’s bye-bye flowers!
Houseplants last much longer. Even the blackest of thumbs can’t manage to kill a plant in a
week (don’t take that as a challenge though!). Houseplants may last for years as a good
reminder for a thoughtful Valentine’s Day gift.
2. Houseplants are often cheaper
We bet this one is not so obvious, right? You may think of houseplants as an investment. And
some of them are (especially rare specimens). But you can easily find houseplants that cost
10 dollars, and we’re not talking about runts. Prices are going down as the popularity of
houseplants is going up, so even a trip to your local plant nursery won’t break the bank.
3. Houseplants are more environmentally friendly
Most people don’t realize the environmental footprint of the fresh flower industry. That’s
because we tend to associate flowers with nature, and nature can do no wrong, right?
What I Can Do
21
Well, not until it’s exploited for profit at a massive scale. Most cut flowers are grown year-round
in greenhouses and fields heavily laden with pesticides. In the United States, most fresh
flowersare imported. And because the flowers are already cut (so pretty much dead), they are
shipped long distances in refrigerated containers that take a lot of energy to stay cool.
There is also a lot of waste in the flower industry because we all want perfect-looking flowers
with zero blemishes. And not to mention the waste caused by the flowers being thrown away
en-masse if the supermarket can’t sell them within the short window when they look nice and
perky. We’re not saying that houseplants have a zero-carbon footprint. But they are definitely
the more responsible choice for eco-conscious Valentines.
4. Houseplants send a message
Now that we got the practical reasons out of the way, let’s talk a bit about the sentimental
symbolism. When you give someone a houseplant, the underlying message is this: I think
you’re a responsible person. I think you can nurture and take care of something. And you can
count on me because I’ll be around to help. Maybe in not so many words. But the sentiment
is there!
If your partner is already someone who loves houseplants, then offering them another plant
for their collection shows that you care about their interests and hobbies. And you get extra
bonus points for being a good listener if they’ve already hinted that they wouldn’t mind another
green friend, and you deliver.

Goldfish, hamsters, and cats do not compare. "What makes dogs so great?" you mightask. That's easy. They are affectionate, smart, and easy to care for.If you have a tough day at school, what do you want to come home to? Do you want to come home to a cat that just looks at you, bored, until youfeed it? No way! How about coming home to a loving dog instead? If you are sad, a good dog will comfort you right away. A dog will jump up on your lap and lick your face until you can't help but smile. Dogs are also super smart! They can play fun games, like fetch. This also means that they are easy to train. You can teach your dog to use the bathroom outside. Most dogs learnthis pretty fast and don't forget it. You can also teach a dog some tricks. With some patience and a couple treats, you can train your dog to put on a show.Last, dogs are easy to take care of. As long as you feed them, love them, and train them, caring for a dog is a breeze. You don't have to worry about cleaning out a dirty litter box or fishbowl. If you are thinking about getting a new pet, you should choose a dog. After all, they are man's best friend.1.

                            22. Who’s the Thief?" by Mendy Kaminker Three angry men presented themselves in King Solomon’s court. “Your Majesty,” said the first, “the three of us are business partners. We went together on a business trip with a large sum of money.” The second picked up the story. “Shortly before Shabbat, we hid the money in a pit we’d dug, planning to dig it up right after Shabbat.” King Solomon listened attentively. It was gone! “But when we went for it, it was gone!” said the third. “No one knew about it but us. One of us is a thief! My lord, I’d like for you to have each of us swear that he didn’t steal the money. That way we’ll find out which of us is the thief!” But King Solomon was in no hurry to do that. He knew that the man who stole the money would also lie and swear falsely. How could he find out which of them was guilty? “Return to me tomorrow,” he told the three. When the partners presented themselves the next day, King Solomon said, “I can see that you three are wise men. Before we discuss your case, I would like your opinion about a different matter.” King Solomon’s flattery worked like magic, and they waited eagerly to hear his problem. “A boy and a girl grew up together, and swore to each other that when they were old enough, they would become husband and wife. At very least, they decided, they’d ask the other’s permission before marrying anyone else. “Years passed. The girl, forgetting her oath, married someone else. Immediately after the wedding, she remembered her earlier commitment and told her husband about it. He said, ‘We can’t live as husband and wife until we find that boy and ask him to annul the oath that you swore to each other!’ “They took a large sum of money and set out to find her childhood friend. They found him and offered to pay him to annul the oath, but he was a good man, so he wished them a hearty mazal tov and refused the money. “On their way home, the happy new couple was robbed. ‘Please give us back the money,’ the woman pleaded. She told the robber about how good her husband was, being so patient as to let her take care of her oath before they moved in together, and how good the boy she’d grown up with was for refusing to take the money. The robber was touched, and returned the purse.” King Solomon looked at the three men, who couldn’t understand where all this was leading. “My question is, which of the people in this story was the most praiseworthy?” asked the king. One of the partners said, “The wife is the most admirable. She kept an oath she made when she was just a girl!” The second partner said, “Her husband is the most praiseworthy. Although he loved his wife, he left home right after his wedding to find that boy, and allowed himself to act as a husband to her only after she was released from her oath.” The last partner said, “Its true, both of them behaved in an exemplary fashion. But the boy was a fool! Why didn’t he take the money when they offered it to him?” “You are the thief!” “You are the thief!” King Solomon bellowed, pointing to the last partner. “When you talk that way about the boy, you show that you have an appetite for money even if you have no right to it. I’m convinced that you stole the money from your partners.” The last partner admitted his guilt, and the other two went home satisfied and impressed by the wisdom of King Solomon1.
