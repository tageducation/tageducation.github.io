What is the bar graph all about? Evaporation - BLUE
Condensation - YELLOW
Surface runoff - GREEN
Precipitation - RED
Transpiration - ORANGE
Water vapor in the atmosphere changes into tiny droplets of water that form
clouds.
Water droplets in the clouds change to rain, dew, hail, sleet, and snow that fall on Earth.
Plants absorb water from runoff and evaporate the water into the atmosphere.
Solar energy makes. water from the oceans and land evaporates and changes into a vapor.
Comes from the precipitation that falls to the ground and is carried by gravity to the rivers, lakes, and back to the oceans,

It is a detailed plan of data gathering and step-by-step procedure in doing the actual experi- ment. In an experimental design, the variables under study are also described and included. Designing and Planning an Experiment Define the Problem What do you want to investigate? State the problem in declarative of interrogative form. State Your Recommendation Are there other problems that come up? What are the things you would like to do to improve the result of the study? Formulate Hypothesis State Your Conclusion The statement of your what do you think will happen? what observations or knowledge in the past are you using in formu- inting the hypothesis? conclusion must be based on the data gathered. Your data should etther support or lead you to another hypothesis. Plan your Experiment Interpret or Analyze Data Is there a need for contral? If so, what is the variable? What are the set standards? Write in detail the methods or procedures of the experiment to make sure that others can repeat the experiment exactly. Write your time table. Do you see patterns or trends in the data? Do the data support your hypothesis? Explain the meaning of the figures. Gather Data What tools are you going to use? Will you observe or measure? How will you gather your data? Organize and Record Data What will you do to organize your data? Will you present them using tables, graphs, diagrams, or Illustrations? ​</a>

Pie graph is also calledgraph that shows the parts that makes a whole. Informationpresented in a circle, which is divided into pieces or parts represents the whole or 100 percent.7.graph is graph in which points representing quantities are connected by a series of shortlines, forming a jagged or smooth curve. It is often used to show changes or trends over time.8. It is important to remember that when formulating graphs and charts, exactmust beobserved. For pie graphs, the division of the parts or slices should be accurately done. For the bar and linegraph, the grid can help provide the better representation of measurements.9. Information map oris a visual image such as a chart or diagram used to representinformation or data. It is great for making complex information easy to understand.

Plants absorb water from runoff and evaporate the water into the atmosphere.
Solar energy makes. water from the oceans and land evaporates and changes into a vapor.
Comes from the precipitation that falls to the ground and is carried by gravity to the rivers, lakes, and back to the oceans,

                            18. Topic 1 LESSON 7 Experimental Design An experimental design describes the complete and orderly steps performed in answering a research problem. It is a detailed plan of data gathering and step-by-step procedure in doing the actual experi- ment. In an experimental design, the variables under study are also described and included. Designing and Planning an Experiment Define the Problem What do you want to investigate? State the problem in declarative of interrogative form. State Your Recommendation Are there other problems that come up? What are the things you would like to do to improve the result of the study? Formulate Hypothesis State Your Conclusion The statement of your what do you think will happen? what observations or knowledge in the past are you using in formu- inting the hypothesis? conclusion must be based on the data gathered. Your data should etther support or lead you to another hypothesis. Plan your Experiment Interpret or Analyze Data Is there a need for contral? If so, what is the variable? What are the set standards? Write in detail the methods or procedures of the experiment to make sure that others can repeat the experiment exactly. Write your time table. Do you see patterns or trends in the data? Do the data support your hypothesis? Explain the meaning of the figures. Gather Data What tools are you going to use? Will you observe or measure? How will you gather your data? Organize and Record Data What will you do to organize your data? Will you present them using tables, graphs, diagrams, or Illustrations? ​</h2><br />

There are three basic types of graphs.line and bar graph.5.graph is a visual comparison of amounts or frequency of occurrences of differentcharacteristics of data. It uses bars to show data trends.6. Pie graph is also calledgraph that shows the parts that makes a whole. Informationpresented in a circle, which is divided into pieces or parts represents the whole or 100 percent.7.graph is graph in which points representing quantities are connected by a series of shortlines, forming a jagged or smooth curve. It is often used to show changes or trends over time.8. It is important to remember that when formulating graphs and charts, exactmust beobserved. For pie graphs, the division of the parts or slices should be accurately done. For the bar and linegraph, the grid can help provide the better representation of measurements.9. Information map oris a visual image such as a chart or diagram used to representinformation or data. It is great for making complex information easy to understand. It can be used to explaina process, summarize a report, compare, and contrast an issue and raise awareness about an issue.10. When reading, do not forget to check for the relevance and accuracy.
