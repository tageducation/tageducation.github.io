                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Soil erosion has negative effects on water quality and on the fish farm itself. You must protect your farm against erosion and its effects if you wish to maintain good levels of production at a reasonable cost. Soil erosion should be controlled, not only on the farm itself but also in the entire catchment basin upstream from it. This is usually the responsibility of the regional administration. All fish farmers involved should seek action or assistance from them if needed. However, on your own land and maybe even in its immediate neighbourhood, you should practise soil conservation wherever necessary. It is best if local farmers work together to achieve this goal.</p><p> </p><p>C hope it helps</p><p></p><p>thank me laturr</p><p> </p><p></p><br />
