                                            Keep in Mind Suggested Time Allotment 10 minutes You have made decisions in the past and will be making still in the coming days, weeks or months. To be better on this, you may want to look back and reflect how you were doing it and be mindful on the learnings that those experiences try to mold in you. Did you have a moment of evaluating your decisions in the past? If so, how did you do it? Here are some pointers for you to make sense out of your past decisions: 1. Did you get the rightful results? Did it really solve your problem? If you answered "yes" to these questions, that's good. If "no", why did you say so? Did your solution create more problems or complications? If that's the case, then, you may take it as a learning experience. Maybe in your next decisions, you can check if your option will really answer the problem or it will create more. If it does, then, it certainly is not the right solution. You could consider other options next time and eliminate the choice that brought you more problems. 2. What were the consequences when you made that decision? What took place after your decision? Did it improve the situation? Did you feel good about it? Decision-making comes with responsibility. It is very ideal for any decision to be favorable for everyone. However, there are times that you need to calculate the risk of your choice. Hence, it has to be a well-calculated one. You are responsible for any decisions that you make. Good or bad, you have to own it. Be wiser with it. 3. Did it contribute to your personal growth in any areas of life (social relationship, academic performance, career pathing, health, spiritual, etc.) With your past decisions, can you identify any significant changes in your life in any aspect of it? For instance, when you decided to continue your studies during this pandemic, did it make a step nearer to your dream of finishing basic education? When you decided to stay at home instead of going out with your friends, did it make any difference to your safety? Try to appreciate whatever gains or personal development you have for any choice that you have. It is a good point of reference for your succeeding decision-making in life. 4. Did it consider the common good? In your past decisions, did it promote the welfare of everyone around you or there are regrets attached to it? There might be times when you are clouded by your personal biases or perceptions. However, the common good would always be a good consideration when weighing your options. At times, there is a need to analyze what is good for you and for everyone. Always try to check what would be good and gain for everyone. Your maturity and experiences aid you to always prioritize the common good. 5. How would that make you as a person?​</a>

                                            <h2 class="ez-toc-section" id="keep-in-mind-suggested-time-allotment-10-minutes-you-have-made-decisions-in-the-past-and-will-be-making-still-in-the-coming-days-weeks-or-months-to-be-better-on-this-you-may-want-to-look-back-and-r">
                            19. Keep in Mind Suggested Time Allotment 10 minutes You have made decisions in the past and will be making still in the coming days, weeks or months. To be better on this, you may want to look back and reflect how you were doing it and be mindful on the learnings that those experiences try to mold in you. Did you have a moment of evaluating your decisions in the past? If so, how did you do it? Here are some pointers for you to make sense out of your past decisions: 1. Did you get the rightful results? Did it really solve your problem? If you answered "yes" to these questions, that's good. If "no", why did you say so? Did your solution create more problems or complications? If that's the case, then, you may take it as a learning experience. Maybe in your next decisions, you can check if your option will really answer the problem or it will create more. If it does, then, it certainly is not the right solution. You could consider other options next time and eliminate the choice that brought you more problems. 2. What were the consequences when you made that decision? What took place after your decision? Did it improve the situation? Did you feel good about it? Decision-making comes with responsibility. It is very ideal for any decision to be favorable for everyone. However, there are times that you need to calculate the risk of your choice. Hence, it has to be a well-calculated one. You are responsible for any decisions that you make. Good or bad, you have to own it. Be wiser with it. 3. Did it contribute to your personal growth in any areas of life (social relationship, academic performance, career pathing, health, spiritual, etc.) With your past decisions, can you identify any significant changes in your life in any aspect of it? For instance, when you decided to continue your studies during this pandemic, did it make a step nearer to your dream of finishing basic education? When you decided to stay at home instead of going out with your friends, did it make any difference to your safety? Try to appreciate whatever gains or personal development you have for any choice that you have. It is a good point of reference for your succeeding decision-making in life. 4. Did it consider the common good? In your past decisions, did it promote the welfare of everyone around you or there are regrets attached to it? There might be times when you are clouded by your personal biases or perceptions. However, the common good would always be a good consideration when weighing your options. At times, there is a need to analyze what is good for you and for everyone. Always try to check what would be good and gain for everyone. Your maturity and experiences aid you to always prioritize the common good. 5. How would that make you as a person?​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>FUN FACT ABOUT PANGEA AND PANGEAULTIMA</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Pangaea was the most recent supercontinent to have existed and the first to be reconstructed by geologists. The distribution of fossils across the continents is one line of evidence pointing to the existence of Pangaea.Pangaea Proxima (also called Pangaea Ultima, Neopangaea, and Pangaea II) is a possible future supercontinent configuration. Consistent with the supercontinent cycle, Pangaea Proxima could occur within the next 200 million years.Pangea Ultima is projected as the next supercontinent 250 million years. If you incorporate the velocities and trajectories of current plate movement, then you can model how continents will evolve. The landmass itself would extend 13,000 miles with one superocean covering two-thirds of Earth.</p><br />
