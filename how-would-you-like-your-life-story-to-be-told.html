He lived on the sweet grass by the forest pool but he felt very bored. One day, he notice a large eagle flying overhead. He looked gracefully, flying so easy that the tortoise dicided he would learn how to fly too. When the eagle came to rest on a rock near the pool, the tortoise got hes chance and said, Oh, handsome eagle, you fly so well. Please teach me how to fly. The eagle was surprised. What? Teach you how to fly? You have no wings or feathers! Again the tortoise pleaded, Oh please eagle, I'm sure I can learn. The tortoise continued asking the eagle to teach him how to fly, Finally, the eagle agreed. He picked up tortoise with his claws and they flew high in the sky. Then he let go off tortoise and told him flap his legs and fly. The tortoise flapped his legs as hard as he could, but he fell like a stone towards the ground. Luckily, he fell into a bush.

                                            please answer this..title - ChangesBy Rachael C CastroWhen I was younger. I could still hear my father play music using theturntable And as the time goes by, nobody under eighteen years old wouldask about, well those next to it like tape recorders, compact disk or CD.Your expressions date you. For example. I am from the group before Martial Law, the time when Filipino pop music was very popular!My father's music pushed me to collect some old-fashioned terms. Telephones now became handy and called cell phones, iceboxes then became refrigerators, now are food-storage systems, the audio system then now a home entertainment center About food, macaroni, noodles, and spaghetti are terms used by the oldies. These are now called pasta.Back then, a camera needed rolls of film for snapshots, while now you can have as many poses as you want plus your selfie. Buy your film in a shopping center now called the mall and have your picture developed by a printing machine which now can be just inside your home beside your laptop a printerPeers instead of pals and role models for heroes. Detention centers for jails and wetland is used to be ecologically correct swamp. Siblings for brothers and sisters, parameters for boundaries, finances for money.Well maybe this is as it should be: marking the time or era or generation with words. I just can't imagine how a divan looks like when one of the supervisors told us to have one inside the room for our cleaning materials. I should have understood it only if she said sofa.Read a short story and answer the following questions; 1. What type of connection is used in the story you have read? 2.

Joseph was next to the youngest son. The father lovedJoseph more than his other children and gave him a beautiful, colorful robe.Joseph's brothers did not like him. One day they sold Joseph to a caravan of peoplegoing to Egypt. But God was with Joseph. There he was sold to Potiphar, captain of theking's guard. He took care of Potiphar's home and all his belongings. One day Potiphar'swife told a lie about Joseph and he was put into prison. God was still with Joseph, takingcare of him and protecting him.In prison the guard found favor in Joseph and put him in charge of all the prisoners.Two prisoners, the chief cup bearer and the chief baker, had dreams, Joseph told themwhat they meant. Soon afterwards the cup bearer went back to work for the king.Two years later the king of Egypt had two dreams and he was sad, because he didnot know what the dreams meant. The cup bearer told the king about Joseph and he wasbrought to the palace. With God's help, Joseph told the king what the dreams meant.There would be seven years when there would be lots of crops and food. Afterwards therewould be seven years of drought, with little rain and very little food.The king put Joseph in charge, second-in-command of Egypt. Joseph helped takecare of the country. He had the people store and save food during the prosperous years,when there was lots of food. This way the people could buy food during drought years,when little food could be grown.One day his brothers came to Egypt to buy food and Joseph gave them food. Whenthey found out that he was their brother, they asked him to forgive them for the wrong thingsthat they had done against him. He forgave them. He invited his whole family to come livein Egypt where he could help take care of them. Joseph was happy to be together againand to see his father again.Joseph told his family that God was always with him, helping to take care of his life.PART 1: PERSONAL QUESTIONSWhat did you learn from the story?1.2.How can you apply this story to your life?Page 1​</a>

                            14. please answer this..title - ChangesBy Rachael C CastroWhen I was younger. I could still hear my father play music using theturntable And as the time goes by, nobody under eighteen years old wouldask about, well those next to it like tape recorders, compact disk or CD.Your expressions date you. For example. I am from the group before Martial Law, the time when Filipino pop music was very popular!My father's music pushed me to collect some old-fashioned terms. Telephones now became handy and called cell phones, iceboxes then became refrigerators, now are food-storage systems, the audio system then now a home entertainment center About food, macaroni, noodles, and spaghetti are terms used by the oldies. These are now called pasta.Back then, a camera needed rolls of film for snapshots, while now you can have as many poses as you want plus your selfie. Buy your film in a shopping center now called the mall and have your picture developed by a printing machine which now can be just inside your home beside your laptop a printerPeers instead of pals and role models for heroes. Detention centers for jails and wetland is used to be ecologically correct swamp. Siblings for brothers and sisters, parameters for boundaries, finances for money.Well maybe this is as it should be: marking the time or era or generation with words. I just can't imagine how a divan looks like when one of the supervisors told us to have one inside the room for our cleaning materials. I should have understood it only if she said sofa.Read a short story and answer the following questions; 1. What type of connection is used in the story you have read? 2.

Joseph was next to the youngest son. The father lovedJoseph more than his other children and gave him a beautiful, colorful robe.Joseph's brothers did not like him. One day they sold Joseph to a caravan of peoplegoing to Egypt. But God was with Joseph. There he was sold to Potiphar, captain of theking's guard. He took care of Potiphar's home and all his belongings. One day Potiphar'swife told a lie about Joseph and he was put into prison. God was still with Joseph, takingcare of him and protecting him.In prison the guard found favor in Joseph and put him in charge of all the prisoners.Two prisoners, the chief cup bearer and the chief baker, had dreams, Joseph told themwhat they meant. Soon afterwards the cup bearer went back to work for the king.Two years later the king of Egypt had two dreams and he was sad, because he didnot know what the dreams meant. The cup bearer told the king about Joseph and he wasbrought to the palace. With God's help, Joseph told the king what the dreams meant.There would be seven years when there would be lots of crops and food. Afterwards therewould be seven years of drought, with little rain and very little food.The king put Joseph in charge, second-in-command of Egypt. Joseph helped takecare of the country. He had the people store and save food during the prosperous years,when there was lots of food. This way the people could buy food during drought years,when little food could be grown.One day his brothers came to Egypt to buy food and Joseph gave them food. Whenthey found out that he was their brother, they asked him to forgive them for the wrong thingsthat they had done against him. He forgave them.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><strong>How would you like your life story to be told?</strong><strong></strong><p><strong>Life story</strong> or also called as <strong>anecdote</strong> is a short, brief, and interesting story of someone's life or experience. Personally, I would like my life story to be told as:</p><strong>As simple as it can be</strong> - I want a simple depiction of my life events because I really don't like extravagant descriptions. As I have lived my life as simply as I can, I hope someone has noticed this simplicity and tell others how simple I am.<strong>A man with firm decisions</strong> -  I really follow my philosophies in life and as much as I want to, live in peace and harmony with others. I hope that my family would see me as a man of integrity, a man whom can be trusted, and a man worthy of their respect. I may be limited with many things but I think I can do things others can't. I would like them to see that I am the father they can rely on. Unlike those fathers who left them behind, who quit providing for them just because they can't stand other's giving orders to them. I am not competing with others, I just want them to see that I am doing everything for them.<strong>A man who loves God</strong> - above all other things, I really value my faith in God because it gives me hope especially in times of troubles. I have experienced great, marvelous things that I don't even thought would happen to me and that is because I placed my trust and faith to Jesus. I really want to set an example to them and eventually do the same.
