                        I feel confident with my decisions.<p></p><p></p><p><strong>Here's how to convince ourselves of the decisions we make:</strong></p><strong>Think positive</strong><p>The main key to convince yourself is to always think positive. One of the reasons why we don't believe in our own decisions is because we think too much negatively.</p><p>Plus we also always think about the opinions of others that arise from the decisions of every decision we make. Therefore, to avoid doub'ts, try to always think positively with every decision and whatever will happen in the future.</p><strong>Firm your stance</strong><p>A person will continue to experience doub'ts if there is still no strong conviction in him. After trying to always think positively, the next thing we have to do is strengthen our stance. Suggest to the mind that there is nothing to worry about the impact of any decisions that have been made.</p><p>Therefore, if we really want to change, then we must have a strong intention. Don't be half-hearted, let alone have no stand.</p><strong>Ask a trusted person for opinion</strong><p>If at this time we are faced with a difficult decision, there are still many doub'ts after the decision was made. The thing that might be a solution is to tell all our burdens to those closest to us. Like parents, friends, or family.</p><p>Do not be too hasty in making decisions without any input from others. Involve other people in every decision we will or have made. Not only that, if this is done, it can also minimize decisions that are made based solely on emotions, which sometimes tend to be more detrimental.</p><strong>Get closer to God</strong><p>L4stly, draw closer to God. Believe me, the feeling of ‘unease that has been felt so far may be because we have gone too far from the Creator.</p><p>Pray and ask Him for guidance. God knows better what we need, entrust everything only to Him. Rest assured that all the decisions we make are part of the destiny that God has set for his creation.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Learn more about how do you feel at https://brainly.ph/question/4382008</p><p>#SPJ3</p><br />

I also need to consider all the consequences it may bring so that I would never regret all the decisions I have made after the activity. We should also make decisions not based on how we feel but on what is right. We need to keep in mind that emotions play a great role in making decisions and whatever we feel now may not be the same next time. We have to weigh things that some decisions are being affected by our emotions and not by what is right. </p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>3.

It has multiple stages that need to be processed accurately so we can say that the decision is right. We can say that the decision considers the common good if the one who creates it does not only think of him or her. He or she needs to think if the result would be good or not.</p><p>One thing that we should consider in decision-making is the pros and cons of our actions. If we can see that is it for the good of everyone, then we can proceed. If we are hesitant, we should think about it multiple times before finalizing the decision. </p><p><br />To know more about the steps in decision-making, please refer to this link https://brainly.ph/question/5386429.</p><p></p>#BrainlyEveryday<br />

A lot of these hurt you and you are in a lot of pain right now.  </p><p></p><p>But you're a good person, and you might be hurt right now but keep in mind that mistakes are not there for nothing.

It means that you should never make decisions when you're too much happy, sad and mad. lastly, always think of the impact that your decision will ring to yourself and the people around you.</p><p></p><p>Above all this, you are doing great and never be afraid of making excuses.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>. </p><p><strong>Step-by-step explanation:</strong></p><p>1. When making decisions, you have to consider the things that might affect your chances of getting a better deal. You have to think the possibilities that might occur upon making decisions. First and foremost you have to know that you are responsible to your decision. No matter what comes out, you have to accept and admit it. Never ever blame others for your own peace of mind. Second factor, everything happens for a reason. Maybe it happened because it is good for you. Third factor, you have to choose the decisions where you are capable of. Don't just make rush decisions. Think carefully and rationally. It would help you in making and choosing decisions. </p><p></p><p>2. If the decisions I made was close to my target goal, I would be grateful and at the same time proud because I am capable of making decisions on my own. Not all people are capable of getting into wise decisions. Otherwise, I'd still be proud too because I made that decision and as I said I'm responsible of my actions. Atleast I've learned a lesson and experienced it, it could help me arrive in a better decision the next time I had to make. </p><br />

                        Just usually say pretty good, rather than trying to explain. Not so straightforward a question to answer, if you are elements of whether a person is referring to your health, or your life in general.Investigate the situation in details. Create a constructive environment. Generate good alternatives. Explore your options. Select the best solution. Evaluate your plan.The importance of realizing how to make decisions is because the decisions we make today will affect our lives in the future.<p></p><p><strong>Ways To Make Better Decisions:</strong></p><strong>Understand every decision making</strong><p>The first thing that gives us the opportunity to regret is how we don't understand the decision-making process. Research has shown that people don't know why they make certain decisions. Although not all, but this shows that the decision was taken carelessly.</p><p>To reduce regret, you at least need to think clearly before making a decision. You have to measure every decision, where every decision that has more impact you don't have to choose.</p><strong>View all options at the same time</strong><p>Journal of Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes tries to measure how a person makes decisions. A series of experiments were conducted to test this hypothesis. In each experiment, participants were given a series of tests that had slightly different options.</p><p>The results of the study concluded that there were some participants who looked at all options and some did not. And, the result is that participants who check all the options simultaneously have a success rate of up to 22%.</p><strong>Think about the past and the future</strong><p>Take a moment before making a tough decision. Will the decision impact your life 10 years from now or not? Thinking about the future is a must, but you also need to consider each experience before making a decision.</p><strong>Plan every decision in the morning</strong><p>When you wake up, you tend to be a neutral person. Therefore, everything you think about at that time is the best decision. From now on, try to make decisions earlier, in the morning. Because, it can make you make better decisions.</p><p></p><p>Learn more about decisions at https://brainly.ph/question/26490945</p><p>#SPJ3</p><br />
