                                            Set B:Answer and support about this logic.1. In a party, David plays a game with three of his friends: Bill, Nash and John.  He shows to his friends and the guests five caps, three of them are black and two are red.  He puts one cap on each head of his friends whom he asks to sit one behind the other, so that Bill who sits in the front sees none of the players, Nash who sits between can see only Bill, and John who sits at the last can see Nash and Bill.  David asks John about the color of his cap, but the latter replies, “I do not know.” When asked of the same question, Nash answers, “ I don’t know either.” But when Bill is asked about the color of his cap, he gives the right answer.  WHAT IS THE COLOR OF BILL’S CAP?2. If I divide a piece of chalk, what is the least number of pieces of chalk will I get? Exactly, the answer is two.  Now, if I divide and divide every last piece of chalk that I get from the series of division, for sure I would have on the tip of my finger a tiny piece of chalk which is now difficult to divide with a mere use of my fingers.  But provided with a specialized tool which can help me to continue dividing the last piece of chalk, I can proceed in dividing with a number of times as many as I want.  If I stop the work after a countless times of dividing, WILL I END UP WITH SOMETHING OR NOTHING?3.In the province unknown yet to many, every individual there is truthful except for a group of people who everyone knows always tell a lie, the politicians.  At one time that an election is coming, a party of candidates delivers speeches to a certain town.  The last candidate ends his speech: “YES I ACCEPT THE TRUTH THAT I AM A POLITICIAN, if to be a politician is to be a servant.”  If every politician always tells a lie, is it a LIE or a TRUTH for a politician to say “I AM A POLITICIAN”? ​</a>

THE FOX AND THE CROW The fox knows how to flatter, and how to play many cunning tricks Once upon a time he saw a raven, who alighted on a tree with a piece of meat in his beak. The fox seated himself beneath the tree, looked up at him, and began to praise him. "Your color," he began," pure black This proven to me that you possess all the wisdom of Laotrse, who knows how to shroud his learning in darkness. The manner in which you manage to feed your mother shows that your mal affection equals that which the Master Dsong had for his parents. Your voice is rough and strong. It proves that you have the courage with which King Hiang once drove his foes to flight by the mere sound of his voice in truth, you are the king of birds! The raven hearing this, was filled with joy and said "I thank youll thank you! And before he knew it, the meat fell to earth from his opened beak The fox caught it up, devoured it and then said, laughing "Make note of this, my dear sir if someone praises you without occasion, he is sure to have a reason for doing so."​</a>

When it comes to pets, dogs are certainly the best choice. They are loyal,affectionate and active companions. No other choice of pet can compete with a dog.Firstly, dogs are incredibly loyal companions. They see themselves as part of thefamily. Secondly, dogs are extremely affectionate animals. No other animal can showtheir love when you arrive home at the end of the day quite like a dog can. Thirdly,dogs are very active.

Long, long time ago, Arrojo, a young and mighty giant, fell in love with an ordinarymortal girl named Aloya. When this girl died, giant Arojo cried so bitterly that his tearsthen turned into mounds of earth. These eventually became hills as lasting proof of hisgrief, now known as, the Chocolate Hills.4.Looking like giant mole hills, the Chocolate Hills are probably Bohol's most famoustourist attraction. Most people who first see the landscape in pictures can hardlybelieve that these hills are natural artifact or not man-made. If this idea is true, then theeffort of building them surely surpasses the construction of the pyramids in Egypt. Theyare covered with grass, which at the end of the dry season, turns into chocolate brown.It is from this color that the name Chocolate Hills was derived.5. If you wish to go to Chocolate Hills on your own, you can do this. From Tagbilaran,you will have to go to the integrated bus station in Dao and catch a bus going toCarmen. Ask the driver to drop you off at the Chocolate Hills complex which is about 4kilometers before the town of Carmen. From there, have a 10-minute walk along a roadwinding up to the complex.​</a>

He shows to his friends and the guests five caps, three of them are black and two are red.  He puts one cap on each head of his friends whom he asks to sit one behind the other, so that Bill who sits in the front sees none of the players, Nash who sits between can see only Bill, and John who sits at the last can see Nash and Bill.  David asks John about the color of his cap, but the latter replies, “I do not know.” When asked of the same question, Nash answers, “ I don’t know either.” But when Bill is asked about the color of his cap, he gives the right answer.  WHAT IS THE COLOR OF BILL’S CAP?2. If I divide a piece of chalk, what is the least number of pieces of chalk will I get? Exactly, the answer is two.  Now, if I divide and divide every last piece of chalk that I get from the series of division, for sure I would have on the tip of my finger a tiny piece of chalk which is now difficult to divide with a mere use of my fingers.  But provided with a specialized tool which can help me to continue dividing the last piece of chalk, I can proceed in dividing with a number of times as many as I want.  If I stop the work after a countless times of dividing, WILL I END UP WITH SOMETHING OR NOTHING?3.In the province unknown yet to many, every individual there is truthful except for a group of people who everyone knows always tell a lie, the politicians.

Long, long time ago, Arrojo, a young and mighty giant, fell in love with an ordinarymortal girl named Aloya.
