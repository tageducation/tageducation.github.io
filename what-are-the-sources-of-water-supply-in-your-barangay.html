It has a large amount of satt, it is found in the seas and oceans, Seawater can be classified as hard water. 2. Freshwater. Some portion of earth's freshwater comes from surface water. This is found in open but small bodies of water like waterfalls, rivers, lakes, creeks, and porids. Surface water comes mostly frm rain. Rainwater flows from land into strearns and rivers. In cold countries, it also comes from now. Great quantities of snow accumulate on highlands and mountains during winter. In spring the snc mells and runs off info surface water. Groundwater is found beneath the earth's surface. It comes from water that seeps into the groum These accumulate in the underground layer called water table. Groundwater is the safe source water. It is considered the cleanest water and contains plenty of dissolved minerals which the h</p><p></p><p>body needs. Springs are openings of the groundwater directly to the earth's surface.</p><br />
