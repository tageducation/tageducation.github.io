This scenario reminds me of my high school days when we used to go to malls after class hours with my friends. 18. That picture I am looking at reminded me of my primary years where ! used to cry before entering my classroom. 19. The message of this portrait depicts the real situation of what is happening now in our nature. 20. This text/passage is the same as the lesson we discussed in science about the prevention of the possible spread of corona virus.​</a>

I kept myself
I hid to deep
Burned myself, with my own heat
i must go out, must go with the flow
My red tears shouted pain, as it glows
So as iam, later on it would be touch 
I freed my burning self and i'll go reach the top</a>

                        <p> It's been a long time since I've thought about my high school self. I was a different person back then, or at least I thought I was. I was more naive and more trusting. I was also more outgoing and more confident. I thought I knew who I was and what I wanted in life. I was wrong about a lot of things, but I'm grateful for the person I was back then. I'm a better person now because of the lessons I learned in high school.</p><p>High school was a time of growth and discovery for me. I was figuring out who I was and who I wanted to be. I made mistakes and I learned from them. I had highs and lows, but overall it was a positive experience. I made lifelong friends and I learned how to be independent. I grew as a person and I'm better for it.</p><p>I'm not the same person I was in high school, but that's okay.

                        <p>Answer:</p><p>DUCATION in SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL</p><p></p><p>Senior High School is a stepping stone towards the preparation of an individual for the “real world”. The next stage after education has ideas of competition, salary, bills, stability, and independence. What one learns in Senior High School is simply grooming, priming, readying, conditioning, and educating for what is next.</p><p></p><p>Senior High School is the best stage to learn about what is really best for you. You get to try out things from your soon-to-be course in college and further later work or job. You can evaluate if it is something you would really want.</p><p></p><p>Topics like application and resume writing in Senior High School is what would be most practical to learn. It is not discussed or taught in-depth now, however, it is very important in the future. In general, Senior High School would put in the proper perspective for students making us more prepared for collegiate education.</p><p>Explanation:</p><p>Hope its help </p><br />

Everything was sunshine and Rainbow and as a kid in my position, it wasn't a surprise. <br /><br />Moving onto High school, the stage of changes and growing up into a young adult. Firstly, it started of me becoming rebellious towards others in that stage. I was no longer shy and had confidence. I was becoming more into academics and strived to be successful. <br /><br />Now that I am a proud College student, my characteristics haven't changed since then. My interests in life and academics barely moved and now I am as happy as I can be!<br /><br />Hope that helps! Keep on Learning! #Brainliest</p><br />

I don’t think they change a great deal, just get more ingrained with maturity. A sense of self worth. An accepting attitude towards authority. The desire to excel, or at least, do well. The ability to use your time wisely, and to my mind, a friendly, non judgemental attitude to others.

The next stage after education has ideas of competition, salary, bills, stability, and independence. What one learns in Senior High School is simply grooming, priming, readying, conditioning, and educating for what is next.</p><p></p><p>Senior High School is the best stage to learn about what is really best for you. You get to try out things from your soon-to-be course in college and further later work or job. You can evaluate if it is something you would really want.</p><p></p><p>Topics like application and resume writing in Senior High School is what would be most practical to learn. It is not discussed or taught in-depth now, however, it is very important in the future. In general, Senior High School would put in the proper perspective for students making us more prepared for collegiate education.</p><br />
