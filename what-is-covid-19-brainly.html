                                            Education is of great consequence to children for they are the future of the nation. President Duterte echoed this sentiment when he said, "the future of this country depends on how we educate our young people nowadays." The DepEd's aspiration to continue the formal education of the youth through alternative and innovative learning pathways despite the prevalent COVID-19 threat becomes all the more pertinent and relevant. While there are challenges in implementing "blended learning", the need to educate the young people of the country is not only essential but also imperative. Taking into consideration all the perceived challenges that "blended learning" may encounter, the support for and cooperation with the DepEd among all possible stakeholders is crucial. In this regard, it is reassuring that President Duterte said, "it is but good that the government is full force in its support to DepEd to fully extend all the necessary assistance for DepEd to carry out blended learning." There is no doubt that the DepEd through the active and able leadership of Sec. Briones will ensure that everything will be on-track and in place for "blended learning" to work. Nevertheless, it is also the responsibility of parents and guardians to decide what's best for their children based on their respective realities. The decision to enroll or not is a voluntary process, and it is in the hands of parents/guardians to decide whether to allow their children to attend formal education this school year (2020-2021) or not.

Write your answer on a separate sheet of paper. UNDERSTANDING THE DISTANCE LEARNING DELIVERY MODALITIES Adopting to the challenges of the times in fulfilling its mandate, the DepEd would be using blended and distance learning programs during this period of COVID-19 pandemic consistent with the President's preference that children would not be sent to school until it is safe to do so. There are three kinds of DLDM, the Modular Distance Learning (MDL), the Blended Leaning (BL) , and Homeschooling. The MDL, which is for learners who do not have internet connectivity. The Printed or Digital Modules (PDM) are delivered to the homes of learners or picked up by their parents or guardians at designated places within coordinated schedules. Digital means modules (e-modules) are saved in USB/flash drives, CDs, OTGs. To be able to access the content of these materials, laptops, computers or tablets are needed. For the Online Distance Learning (ODL),this modality is applicable to learners as well as teachers with technology devices in which internet connectivity is required. The second DLDM is the Blended Leaning (BL) which is a combination of ODL, MDL, and R/TVI. The learners make use of computers, tablets, smart phones, CD/DVD, USB storage, TV, /Radio and Printed Modules in learning. Through this modality learners are not required to report to school, physical distancing is observed and the number of people going out from their homes is minimized. The third DLDM is Homeschooling, It is the alternative learning modality learners that provides learners with access to formal education while staying in a home-based environment with a parent, guardian or tutors as authorized learning facilitators instead of classroom teachers.

                            12. Education is of great consequence to children for they are the future of the nation. President Duterte echoed this sentiment when he said, "the future of this country depends on how we educate our young people nowadays." The DepEd's aspiration to continue the formal education of the youth through alternative and innovative learning pathways despite the prevalent COVID-19 threat becomes all the more pertinent and relevant. While there are challenges in implementing "blended learning", the need to educate the young people of the country is not only essential but also imperative. Taking into consideration all the perceived challenges that "blended learning" may encounter, the support for and cooperation with the DepEd among all possible stakeholders is crucial. In this regard, it is reassuring that President Duterte said, "it is but good that the government is full force in its support to DepEd to fully extend all the necessary assistance for DepEd to carry out blended learning." There is no doubt that the DepEd through the active and able leadership of Sec. Briones will ensure that everything will be on-track and in place for "blended learning" to work. Nevertheless, it is also the responsibility of parents and guardians to decide what's best for their children based on their respective realities. The decision to enroll or not is a voluntary process, and it is in the hands of parents/guardians to decide whether to allow their children to attend formal education this school year (2020-2021) or not.

Write your answer on a separate sheet of paper. UNDERSTANDING THE DISTANCE LEARNING DELIVERY MODALITIES Adopting to the challenges of the times in fulfilling its mandate, the DepEd would be using blended and distance learning programs during this period of COVID-19 pandemic consistent with the President's preference that children would not be sent to school until it is safe to do so. There are three kinds of DLDM, the Modular Distance Learning (MDL), the Blended Leaning (BL) , and Homeschooling. The MDL, which is for learners who do not have internet connectivity. The Printed or Digital Modules (PDM) are delivered to the homes of learners or picked up by their parents or guardians at designated places within coordinated schedules. Digital means modules (e-modules) are saved in USB/flash drives, CDs, OTGs. To be able to access the content of these materials, laptops, computers or tablets are needed. For the Online Distance Learning (ODL),this modality is applicable to learners as well as teachers with technology devices in which internet connectivity is required. The second DLDM is the Blended Leaning (BL) which is a combination of ODL, MDL, and R/TVI. The learners make use of computers, tablets, smart phones, CD/DVD, USB storage, TV, /Radio and Printed Modules in learning. Through this modality learners are not required to report to school, physical distancing is observed and the number of people going out from their homes is minimized. The third DLDM is Homeschooling, It is the alternative learning modality learners that provides learners with access to formal education while staying in a home-based environment with a parent, guardian or tutors as authorized learning facilitators instead of classroom teachers.
