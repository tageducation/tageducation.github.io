Data for continuous variables is obtained from the measurement process so that the data can be in the form of fractions or in decimal form,<strong> for example, </strong>3.5 meters, value 7.5, average 7.0 and others. In general, continuous variables have values ​​which are the results of measurements. <strong>Examples of data</strong> for these variables are test scores, rankings, height, weight, length, distance. If grouped, data for continuous variables can be classified as ordinal data, interval data and ratio data.</p><p></p><p></p><p>For more information about discrete variables, click the link below.</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/18953121</p><p></p><p>#SPJ3</p><br />
