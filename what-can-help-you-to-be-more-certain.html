                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>For me, to make me more certain about something, you need first to give all the reasons or evidence that I need to identify if it is true or not. Second I will also do some research and ask questions to the people that I know that can help me. I will gather all the information I have got, then I can now be certain to something. Because you can not be certain to something you can not understand.</p><p></p><p></p><p>-I hope you can understand my grammar.</p><p></p><p>#CARRYONLEARNING</p><p></p><br />
