                                            (1) One of the most affected segments of our society that has been shaken by the global pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus, SARS COV-2, is the education sector. The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the lives of all learners in the Philippines since March. There have been many stories of learners being concerned by the spread of the deadly virus as schools across the country were closed. This is the first pandemic to have had a huge impact on education not only in the Philippines but across the world. (2) Countries like South Korea and France have been forced to close their schools shortly after they re-opened due to increase in coronavirus cases, in the Philippines, while the government and health officials are trying to flatten the curve of the deadly virus, the Department of Education (DepEd) is working hard to transition the modality of teaching from conventional "face-to-face" learning to so-called "blended learning." At the moment, the DepEd is absorbed in its month-long "remote enrollment process". which started on June 1, 2020.​</a>

You may use the transcript below as a reference. The Department of Education (DepEd) said the class opening this academic year has been a success, regardless of the sudden shift to distance/blended leaming and the challenges that go with it. Education Secretary Leonor Magtolis Briones said the Department concentrated on implementing learning modalities during the first few weeks of classes. "The opening of the school year has generally been very successful, and we will continue to face any challence that lies ahead with great resolve to continue education in the country", Briones said. Even if the Department has reported errors in the self-learning modules, it only pushes DepEd to do better. Briones said the fact that millions of students continue to pursue their education is inspiring and encouraging. The Department remains steadfast in its commitment to provide all learners with the quality education they deserve. We will continue to work hand in hand with our stakeholders to continue education for Filipinos across the country amid these trying times, she said.GIVE THE FOLLOWING (POINT/CLAIM)=(EVIDENCE E)=(EXPLANATION)=​</a>

                                            What is Globalization?We often hear the word globalization in many contexts and repeated frequently as a concept to denote more trade, foreign companies, and even the ongoing economic crisis. Before we launch into a full-fledged review of the term and its various manifestations, we should consider what we mean when we say globalization.Globalization is the free movement of goods, services, and people across the world in a seamless and integrated manner. Globalization can be the result of the opening up of the global economy and the concomitant increase in trade between nations. In other words, when countries that were hitherto closed to trade and foreign investment open up their economies and go global, the result is increasing interconnectedness and integration of the world economies.Globalization can also mean that countries liberalize their import protocols and welcome foreign investment into sectors that are the mainstays of its economy. Globalization means that countries attract global capital by opening up their economies to multinational corporations. Globalization also means that countries liberalize their visa rules and procedures to permit the free flow of people from country to country. Globalization frees up the unproductive sectors to investment and the productive sectors to export-related activities resulting in a win-win situation for world economies.Source: https://www.managementstudyguide.com/what-is-globalization.htmAnswer the following questions:1.

Then, find the details with similar thoughts and their differences. NEWSPAPER: 748 private schools suspend operations By Janvic Mateo Hundreds of private elementary and high schools across the country will suspend operations this school year due to low enrollment of students, according to the Department of Education (DepEd). Data released this week by DepEd showed that 748 out of 14, 435 private schools nationwide have already given notice that they will not operate for school year 2020-2021. Most of those that will suspend operations are in Central Luzon with 141, followed by Calabarzon with 121, Metro Manila with 96 and Western Visayas with 90. The suspensions affect 3,233 teachers and 40,345 learners. DepEd reported that 329 are elementary schools, 18 are purely junior high school and 30 purely senior high school. DepEd Undersecretary Jesus Mateo said low enrollment was the primary reason for not operating. He previously said that the cost of continuing operations under the blended learning setup was also a factor in the decision of some schools not to open this year. "(They are saying) that it would be temporary closure. But if the situation improves next year, they will reopen," he added. Face-to-face classes have been suspended for the rest of the year due to the risks of the COVID-19 pandemic. This prompted schools to adopt distance learning approaches, such as shifting to online or modular-based learning. Latest data showed that only 2.02 million students have so far enrolled in private schools, representing only 47.14 percent of the more than four million student population in private schools last year. More than 24.3 million elementary and high school students had expressed their intention to enroll in public and private schools this school year, representing 87.82 percent of the student population last year. Over 22.22 million signed up in public schools, while almost 400,000 students from private schools have transferred to public schools for the upcoming school year set to start Oct. 5. Education Secretary Leonor Briones said they are hopeful that the schools would reconsider their position, noting the improving economy that may push enrollment in the private sector.

ONLINE ARTICLE: 748 private schools suspend operation amid Covid-19 pandemic By Jasmine C. Posted on September 10, 2020 Metro Manila - Thousands of students and teachers across the country will be affected as hundreds of private elementary and high schools will be suspending its operation due to low enrollment of students. According to the data released by DepEd, 748 out of 14, 435 private schools across the country have sent their notice that they will temporarily suspend operations for the 2020-2021 school year. Schools in Central Luzon got the majority on the list with 141, followed by Calabarzon with 121, Metro Manila at 96 and Western Visayas with 90. The suspension will affect 40,345 and 3,233 teachers across the 329 elementary school with 18 junior high schools and 30 purely senior high schools. DepEd Undersecretary Jesus Mateo said that low enrollment was the main culprit of the temporary suspension of operation. He added that the continuing operations under different learning setup was also a factor of some of the school not to open for the upcoming school year. Education Secretary Leonor Briones, on the other hand, also attributed the temporary closure to lack of parent's income that leads to students of not enrolling for this school year. DepEd has allowed private schools to open its classes before October 5, provided that they will implement distance learning approach. Source: Jasmine C.

                            9. What is Globalization?We often hear the word globalization in many contexts and repeated frequently as a concept to denote more trade, foreign companies, and even the ongoing economic crisis. Before we launch into a full-fledged review of the term and its various manifestations, we should consider what we mean when we say globalization.Globalization is the free movement of goods, services, and people across the world in a seamless and integrated manner. Globalization can be the result of the opening up of the global economy and the concomitant increase in trade between nations. In other words, when countries that were hitherto closed to trade and foreign investment open up their economies and go global, the result is increasing interconnectedness and integration of the world economies.Globalization can also mean that countries liberalize their import protocols and welcome foreign investment into sectors that are the mainstays of its economy. Globalization means that countries attract global capital by opening up their economies to multinational corporations. Globalization also means that countries liberalize their visa rules and procedures to permit the free flow of people from country to country. Globalization frees up the unproductive sectors to investment and the productive sectors to export-related activities resulting in a win-win situation for world economies.Source: https://www.managementstudyguide.com/what-is-globalization.htmAnswer the following questions:1.

Then, find the details with similar thoughts and their differences. NEWSPAPER: 748 private schools suspend operations By Janvic Mateo Hundreds of private elementary and high schools across the country will suspend operations this school year due to low enrollment of students, according to the Department of Education (DepEd). Data released this week by DepEd showed that 748 out of 14, 435 private schools nationwide have already given notice that they will not operate for school year 2020-2021. Most of those that will suspend operations are in Central Luzon with 141, followed by Calabarzon with 121, Metro Manila with 96 and Western Visayas with 90. The suspensions affect 3,233 teachers and 40,345 learners. DepEd reported that 329 are elementary schools, 18 are purely junior high school and 30 purely senior high school. DepEd Undersecretary Jesus Mateo said low enrollment was the primary reason for not operating. He previously said that the cost of continuing operations under the blended learning setup was also a factor in the decision of some schools not to open this year. "(They are saying) that it would be temporary closure. But if the situation improves next year, they will reopen," he added. Face-to-face classes have been suspended for the rest of the year due to the risks of the COVID-19 pandemic. This prompted schools to adopt distance learning approaches, such as shifting to online or modular-based learning. Latest data showed that only 2.02 million students have so far enrolled in private schools, representing only 47.14 percent of the more than four million student population in private schools last year. More than 24.3 million elementary and high school students had expressed their intention to enroll in public and private schools this school year, representing 87.82 percent of the student population last year. Over 22.22 million signed up in public schools, while almost 400,000 students from private schools have transferred to public schools for the upcoming school year set to start Oct. 5. Education Secretary Leonor Briones said they are hopeful that the schools would reconsider their position, noting the improving economy that may push enrollment in the private sector.

ONLINE ARTICLE: 748 private schools suspend operation amid Covid-19 pandemic By Jasmine C. Posted on September 10, 2020 Metro Manila - Thousands of students and teachers across the country will be affected as hundreds of private elementary and high schools will be suspending its operation due to low enrollment of students. According to the data released by DepEd, 748 out of 14, 435 private schools across the country have sent their notice that they will temporarily suspend operations for the 2020-2021 school year. Schools in Central Luzon got the majority on the list with 141, followed by Calabarzon with 121, Metro Manila at 96 and Western Visayas with 90. The suspension will affect 40,345 and 3,233 teachers across the 329 elementary school with 18 junior high schools and 30 purely senior high schools. DepEd Undersecretary Jesus Mateo said that low enrollment was the main culprit of the temporary suspension of operation. He added that the continuing operations under different learning setup was also a factor of some of the school not to open for the upcoming school year. Education Secretary Leonor Briones, on the other hand, also attributed the temporary closure to lack of parent's income that leads to students of not enrolling for this school year. DepEd has allowed private schools to open its classes before October 5, provided that they will implement distance learning approach. Source: Jasmine C.

The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the lives of all learners in thePhilippines since March. There have been many stories of learners being concernedby the spread of the deadly virus as schools across the country were closed. This isthe first pandemic to have had a huge impact on education not only in the Philippinesbut across the world.(2) Countries like South Korea and France have been forced to close their schools shortly after they re-opened due to increase in coronavirus cases. In the Philippines, while the government and health officials are trying to flatten the curve of the deadly virus, the Department of Education  is working hard to transition the modality of teaching from conventional "face-to-face" learning to so called "blended learning." At the moment, the DepEd is absorbed in its month-long "remote enrollment process", which started on June 1, 2020.THESE ARE THE STEPS IN THE PICTUREIDENTIFY THE MAIN IDEA/SLOOK FOR THE ESSENTIALDETAILS NECESSARY FORBSUPPORTING THE MAIN IDEA/SLIST AND ARANGE THE KEY POINTS (main idea/s and essential details necessary for supporting the main idea/s).WRITE A SHOETENED VERSION OF THE TEXT IN YOUR OWN WORDS.COMBINE WORDS OR IDEASI hope you can answer this because deadline is 2:00 pm:]​</h2><br />
