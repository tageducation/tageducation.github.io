                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Your Motivation to Pursue a Health Care Career. </p><p>How Are You Going to Get Education and Training for Your Career. </p><p>Skills and Strengths a Fit for the Health Care Industry.</p><p>Going into the field of healthcare is a serious decision. There are various motivations like money, title, sense of purpose, passion to help people, etc. At the same time, professionals in that field need a certain skill set not only in critical thinking but also in communication abilities.</p><p>There are multiple factors to consider, so you can ask yourself these questions:</p> <strong>What motivates me to work in the field of healthcare?</strong> If the core of your Why does not match the passion you have for this career, all else will fall through. <strong>How good is my study ethic?</strong> Getting that dream job does not happen in an instant, especially in this field - which would take about 10-15 years before you become a doctor with a specialization. If you do not have the grit and resilience to study medicine, you might as well choose another path. Note: because it will take years, think of the costs as well. <strong>How good is my work ethic?</strong> Another thing to take note of is the irregularity of work hours that professionals in healthcare experience. This is relevant now - when the Covid-19 pandemic is highly affecting nations. Healthcare professionals go out to work to treat people while risking their lives. <strong>Do I have the skill set to become a healthcare professional? </strong>Every healthcare career demands a high level of skill set and personality traits. We must always remember that treating patients is not just diagnosing the illness and solving a puzzle (which would require critical thinking skills) but also interacting with patients, getting them to trust you enough to tell the truth about what happened to them, and being assured that they will be taken care of (which would require interpersonal skills). <strong>What specific field in healthcare do I want to pursue? </strong>There are different specialties that a healthcare professional has because there are various fields in medicine. If you want to treat kids, you can be a pediatrician. If you have great precision and stable hands, perhaps you could start exploring surgery. The skill set and interests you have should match the type of field you want to pursue in healthcare.<br />
