This paper would have been even better if the student had added a sentence or two about the results of the study. That way, after reading the first paragraph, the reader would know the purpose, hypotheses, and findings. Next, the student described specifics about the research design, including the sample, instrumentation, and data analysis. Ecological and population generalizability were discussed. The student spoke at length on threats to internal validity. Following the information on threats to internal validity, the student provided suggestions regarding how these threats could have been dealt with. This shows a high level of understanding. Not only does the student know what the weakness of the study are, he provides ways the study could have been improved. One thing that was not discussed in this paper is the literature review. That's why you'll see some fairly complex explanations in this paper on the data analysis but no information on the literature review. Your paper will contain information on the literature review and less specific information on statistics.”What type of work is being critiqued?A. CreativeB. ResearchC. MediaD. Literarys​</a>

This paper would have been even better if the student had added a sentence or two about the results of the study. That way, after reading the first paragraph, the reader would know the purpose, hypotheses, and findings. Next, the student described specifics about the research design, including the sample, instrumentation, and data analysis. Ecological and population generalizability were discussed. The student spoke at length on threats to internal validity. Following the information on threats to internal validity, the student provided suggestions regarding how these threats could have been dealt with. This shows a high level of understanding. Not only does the student know what the weakness of the study are, he provides ways the study could have been improved. One thing that was not discussed in this paper is the literature review. That's why you'll see some fairly complex explanations in this paper on the data analysis but no information on the literature review. Your paper will contain information on the literature review and less specific information on statistics.”What type of work is being critiqued?A. CreativeB. ResearchC. MediaD. Literarys​</h2><br />
