______1. Social constructivists believe that individuals seek understanding of the
world in which they live and work.
______2. The goal of the research is to rely as much as possible on the participants’
views of the situation being studied.
______3. The more open-ended the questioning, the better, as the researcher
listens carefully to what people say or do in their life settings.
______4. Constructivist researchers often address the processes of interaction
among individuals. They also focus on the specific contexts in which people live
and work in order to understand the historical and cultural settings of the
participants.
______5. Researchers recognize that their own backgrounds shape their
interpretation, and they position themselves in the research to acknowledge how
their interpretation flows from their personal, cultural, and historical experiences.
______6. Human beings construct meanings as they engage with the world they
are interpreting.
______7. Humans engage with their world and make sense of it based on their
historical and social perspectives—we are all born into a world of meaning

participants through visiting this context and gathering information personally.
They also interpret what they find, an interpretation shaped by the researcher’s
own experiences and background.
______9. The basic generation of meaning is always social, arising in and out of
interaction with a human community. The process of qualitative research is largely
inductive; the inquirer generates meaning from the data collected in the field.
