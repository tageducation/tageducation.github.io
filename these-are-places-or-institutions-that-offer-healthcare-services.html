Hospitals with extensive emergency rooms and trauma centers are as varied as modest clinics and doctors' offices. This includes Medical Nursing Homes that provide short-term or long-term medical therapy to inpatients that hospitals do not provide. Pharmacies and drug stores that sells prescription and nonprescription pharmaceuticals. Lastly a medical or clinical laboratory that conducts fundamental or applied research to help advance medical understanding.</p><p></p><p>2. <strong>Insurance</strong> is financial agreement between an insurance company and an individual or group.</p><p>Term in law and economics. People buy it to avoid losing money. Insurance buyers pay a "premium" (typically monthly) and vow to be careful (a "duty of care"). In exchange, if anything bad occurs to the insured person or item, the insurance company reimburses the money.Companies sell insurance products to protect you and/or your property from loss, damage, or theft.</p><p></p><p>3. <strong>Health professionals</strong> are individuals who are licensed to practice medicine.</p><p>A health professional who has been trained in the health area. A health practitioner has often been trained in a certain medical or psychiatric sector. These include doctors, therapists, and lab technicians, and a lot more.
