                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.The atmosphere is comprised of layers based on temperature. These layers are the troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere and thermosphere. A further region at about 500 km above the Earth's surface is called the exosphere.</p><p></p><p>2.Temperature in the stratosphere rises with increasing altitude, because the ozone layer absorbs the greater part of the solar ultraviolet radiation. The ozone layer is an absorbing agent that protects life on Earth.</p><p></p><p>3.In the troposphere, the temperature generally decreases with altitude. The reason is that the troposphere's gases absorb very little of the incoming solar radiation. Instead, the ground absorbs this radiation and then heats the tropospheric air by conduction and convection.</p><p></p><p>4.The stratospheric ozone layer absorbs ultraviolet (UV) radiation, preventing dangerous UV rays from hitting Earth's surface and harming living organisms.</p><p></p><p>5.Thus the air temperature is highest near the surface and decreases as altitude increases. ... Therefore, air pressure decreases as we increase altitude. The air density depends on both the temperature and the pressure through the equation of state and also decreases with increasing altitude.</p><p></p><p>6.The stratosphere is a layer of Earth's atmosphere. It is the second layer of the atmosphere as you go upward.</p><p></p><p>7.Stratosphere. The Stratosphere extends around 31 miles (50 km) down to anywhere from 4 to 12 miles (6 to 20 km) above the Earth's surface. This layer holds 19 percent of the atmosphere's gases but very little water vapor. In this region the temperature increases with height.</p><br />

The troposphere contains the majority of cloud types and practically all weather happens inside this layer.</p><p>5. The troposphere contains the majority of the atmosphere's water vapor, as well as dust and ash particles, which explains why the majority of Earth's clouds are situated in this layer.</p><p>6. The stratosphere is the layer of air above the tropopause. Solar radiation is absorbed by a layer of ozone molecules, which heats the stratosphere. Unlike in the troposphere, the air in the stratosphere remains stable because it is surrounded by warmer, less dense air.</p><p>7. According to the National Center for Atmospheric Research and the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research's UCAR Office of Programs, all weather happens in the troposphere.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>C. It enters the Earth through the air particles like dusts, oxygen particles, etc. because those particles reflects the sun's light to deliver it to Earth's surface. The more air particles, the more light we receive. Vice versa when the air particles are less.</p><br />

                        ❄️ answer:❄️<p></p><p></p>4.A<strong>because↓</strong><p><strong>From lowest to highest, the major layers are the troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, thermosphere and exosphere.</strong></p><p></p><strong>5.D</strong><strong>because</strong><strong>↓</strong><strong>troposphere</strong><p></p><p><strong>Thus, we can say that almost all known weather phenomena take place in the troposphere. Mesosphere is the third layer of the atmosphere, and is mainly responsible for burning off meteors that enter the earth's atmosphere.</strong></p><p></p><p></p><strong>6.A</strong><strong>because</strong><strong>↓</strong><p></p>The thermosphere is often considered the "hot layer" because it contains the warmest temperatures in the atmosphere. Temperature increases with height until the estimated top of the thermosphere at 500 km. Temperatures can reach as high as 2000 K or 1727 ºC in this layer (Wallace and Hobbs 24).<p></p><p></p>7.Dbecause↓<p></p><p><strong>Troposphere layer of the atmosphere has the highest density of gas molecules.</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><strong>8.A</strong><strong>because</strong><strong>↓</strong><p></p><p><strong>Once the sun's energy reaches earth, it is intercepted first by the atmosphere.

In it, temperature decreases with altitude. The troposphere gets some of its heat directly from the sun.</strong></p><p></p><p></p><strong>10.</strong><strong>A</strong><strong>Because</strong><strong>↓</strong><p></p><p><strong>When fossil fuels are burned, they release nitrogen oxides into the atmosphere, which contribute to the formation of smog and acid rain.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>c.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Energy is transferred from the sun to Earth via electromagnetic waves, or radiation. Most of the energy that passes through the upper atmosphere and reaches Earth's surface is in two forms, visible and infrared light. ...
