Do this on your answer sheet Savy, The Friendliest Bee by: Francisco N. Aguil Jr In a faraway place called Lala Land lived a swarm of beos. Among the bees, Savy was the most popular of all because of his friendliness. He greeted everybody with a smile. "Hi there! Hello!" Savy addressed almost everyone. "How are you doing?" he asked "I'm happy to see you again, Savy" replied Devy. "Your smile made my day," she further said. Savy was also a helpful bee, "Let me help you sip that honey," Savy said. "Sure! Thank you very much. I will easily finish my job," Livy answered Aside from being helpful, Savy got an award from the Queen as the most obedient bee too. "Guard our beehive tonight, Savy," the Queen commanded him. "Yes, I will my Queen," Savy'respectfully answered. However, among the bees, Chevy was the only one who was not convinced about Savy's genuine friendliness. "I don't think Savy is being true to everyone. I know he has motive to be the Queen's first soldier," he angrily said to himself. One day, while other bees were busy collecting nectar from flowers to flowers, Chevy was assigned that day to protect the beehive. A group of hive beetles attacked the beehive where Chevy served as the soldier of the day, "Hey, you little bee! Get out of our way! Give us your sweet honey!" the leader of the hive beetle shouted. Chevy was so scared that he didn't even move a bit.Savy saw the whole scenario he immediately flew towards the hive beetles and with all his might he stung them. ouch what are you doing enemies cowardly shouted. A Swarm bee quickly responded against the enemies.in a snap the hive beetles escaped from the raging bees.Can we talk for a minute Savy? asked Chevy Are you ok what is it tell me replied savy i'm sorry because all this time i have an a feeling towards you chevy answered what did i do to hurt you ask savy nothing it is just that i envy you because everybody loves you chevy sadly reply that's all right don't worry we can be friends from then on savy and chevy became the closest friend ever they were the friendliest bees in  lala landtitle________________Characters_____________settings_____________theme___________mood_______________conflict____________plot____________​</a>

                                            What's MoreRead the following passages and identify the narrator's point of view in your answer sheet.1. It's simple to wash your hands the right way, and it usually takes no more thana minute. But did you know that simple scrub can help reduce the spread ofeverything from respiratory illness to diarrhea?Handwashing is also one of the best ways to remove germs, help avoidgetting sick, and prevent the spread of germs. So, handwashing is important toremember, and an important habit to teach your kids.For effective handwashing, follow these five steps: First, wet your handsusing clean, running water when available. Second, lather the front and back ofhands, between fingers, and under fingernails with soap. Third, scrub handstogether for at least 20 seconds. Fourth, rinse hands under clean, runningwater. Finally, dry hands completely with a clean towel, or air dry.Point of View:2. Do you love candy?" I asked my friend Roxis. I always make friends withother people.Point of View3. Daniel was nervous about going to Patricia's birthday party. He was afraid that he wouldn't know anyone but Patricia, and she would be so busy with her guests. "Mom, I don't want to go to the party." Daniel's mother furrowed her brow and said, "Daniel, we already told her we'd be there. We bought her a present. We have to go and give it to her." Daniel shook his head. He still didn't want to go. His mom put her hand on his shoulder. Point of View: 4. Pete didn't feel like doing homework. He felt like playing baseball. He grabbed his mitt off the shelf and began to fantasize about being out in the field. His fantasy was interrupted shortly by the opening of his bedroom door. It was his mom. She started to yell, "Pete, you're not failing baseball class! You're failing math class! You need to study. Put the mitt away!" Pete put the mitt away, but he didn't know the first thing about studying math. Point of View: 5. If you are confused about something in class, don't wait. Raise your hand and ask for help immediately. Do it while your teacher is still explaining the material. Your teacher will probably be happy that you are taking an active part in your education and should attempt to explain the material in a different way. If you are still confused, ask your teacher if he or she is available after class to give you additional instruction. You are worth it. Don't give up on yourself . Point of View:​</a>

Do this on your answer sheet Savy, The Friendliest Bee by: Francisco N. Aguil Jr In a faraway place called Lala Land lived a swarm of beos. Among the bees, Savy was the most popular of all because of his friendliness. He greeted everybody with a smile. "Hi there! Hello!" Savy addressed almost everyone. "How are you doing?" he asked "I'm happy to see you again, Savy" replied Devy. "Your smile made my day," she further said. Savy was also a helpful bee, "Let me help you sip that honey," Savy said. "Sure! Thank you very much. I will easily finish my job," Livy answered Aside from being helpful, Savy got an award from the Queen as the most obedient bee too. "Guard our beehive tonight, Savy," the Queen commanded him. "Yes, I will my Queen," Savy'respectfully answered. However, among the bees, Chevy was the only one who was not convinced about Savy's genuine friendliness. "I don't think Savy is being true to everyone. I know he has motive to be the Queen's first soldier," he angrily said to himself. One day, while other bees were busy collecting nectar from flowers to flowers, Chevy was assigned that day to protect the beehive. A group of hive beetles attacked the beehive where Chevy served as the soldier of the day, "Hey, you little bee! Get out of our way! Give us your sweet honey!" the leader of the hive beetle shouted. Chevy was so scared that he didn't even move a bit.Savy saw the whole scenario he immediately flew towards the hive beetles and with all his might he stung them. ouch what are you doing enemies cowardly shouted.

                            20. What's MoreRead the following passages and identify the narrator's point of view in your answer sheet.1. It's simple to wash your hands the right way, and it usually takes no more thana minute. But did you know that simple scrub can help reduce the spread ofeverything from respiratory illness to diarrhea?Handwashing is also one of the best ways to remove germs, help avoidgetting sick, and prevent the spread of germs. So, handwashing is important toremember, and an important habit to teach your kids.For effective handwashing, follow these five steps: First, wet your handsusing clean, running water when available. Second, lather the front and back ofhands, between fingers, and under fingernails with soap. Third, scrub handstogether for at least 20 seconds. Fourth, rinse hands under clean, runningwater. Finally, dry hands completely with a clean towel, or air dry.Point of View:2. Do you love candy?" I asked my friend Roxis. I always make friends withother people.Point of View3. Daniel was nervous about going to Patricia's birthday party. He was afraid that he wouldn't know anyone but Patricia, and she would be so busy with her guests. "Mom, I don't want to go to the party." Daniel's mother furrowed her brow and said, "Daniel, we already told her we'd be there. We bought her a present. We have to go and give it to her." Daniel shook his head. He still didn't want to go. His mom put her hand on his shoulder. Point of View: 4. Pete didn't feel like doing homework. He felt like playing baseball. He grabbed his mitt off the shelf and began to fantasize about being out in the field. His fantasy was interrupted shortly by the opening of his bedroom door. It was his mom. She started to yell, "Pete, you're not failing baseball class! You're failing math class! You need to study. Put the mitt away!" Pete put the mitt away, but he didn't know the first thing about studying math. Point of View: 5. If you are confused about something in class, don't wait. Raise your hand and ask for help immediately. Do it while your teacher is still explaining the material. Your teacher will probably be happy that you are taking an active part in your education and should attempt to explain the material in a different way. If you are still confused, ask your teacher if he or she is available after class to give you additional instruction. You are worth it. Don't give up on yourself . Point of View:​</h2><br />
