                                            Compare and Contrast Write an essay to compare and contrast Tay and Gonzales Effective Listening Approach in not less than 100 words Gonzalez (2017) defined informational listening as listening with the goal of leaming. understanding, and grasping information. It is considered a passive form of listening because the listener is not judging, criticizing, or evaluating the message but is simply listening to understand it For example, Maria is listening to an informative talk about the modern cultural trends of her fellow millennials. In order to effectively engage in informational listening, Maria must keep her conservative traditional beliefs. bay in order to abstain from judging and critiquing the message her classmate is trying to convey. Tay (2020) identifies some of the effective informational listening approaches which are: Info listening. Make sure you receive the same thoughts which speakers are trying to convey. Don't judge or argue prematurely. Try to understand the speaker's ideas before judging them. Look for key ideas. Listen carefully to the speaker to find out the main ideas that he or she is trying to convey. Paraphrase. Restate in your own words the message of the speaker. Repeating the speaker's words as he or she says them will strengthen his or her message and help you to stay attentive. Gonzalez (2020) also added that informational listening helps us leam, become keener, and become better at what we do in life. Consequently, it is clear that improving skills that develop our informational listening abilities is advantageous to our lives. Other skills that help with informational listening are: Knowledge of Vocabulary. The more words we know, the more we can understand. Therefore, increasing mastery of vocabulary through techniques like leaming a new word a day or reading books can contribute in being a good informational listener. Concentration. We must know that in order to concentrate, we need to be motivated to focus, stay disciplined in the face of distractions, actively and mentally say no to distractions, and accept responsibility in getting the task at hand accomplished. Informational listening requires immense concentration. Memory. With good memory, we can recall experiences and information from our lives to help make sense of information in informational listening. Refraining from Judgment. This skill requires an open mind. If we begin judging and jumping to conclusions when attempting to properly listen and retain information, our mind will wander and possibly miss valuable pieces of information. Organization. This means identifying key concepts from auditory information and mentally organizing them into an outline so that you can better understand and remember material. Asking Questions. If listening to a panel discussion, asking mental questions to further grasp the information as the speakers are talking can mean that the listener is truly comprehending the information that is being said. Taking Notes. This is a common skill that enhances informational listening in school. One valuable tip in taking notes is to only write down key concepts and terms instead of trying to write down everything that is being said.​</a>

                            11. Compare and Contrast Write an essay to compare and contrast Tay and Gonzales Effective Listening Approach in not less than 100 words Gonzalez (2017) defined informational listening as listening with the goal of leaming. understanding, and grasping information. It is considered a passive form of listening because the listener is not judging, criticizing, or evaluating the message but is simply listening to understand it For example, Maria is listening to an informative talk about the modern cultural trends of her fellow millennials. In order to effectively engage in informational listening, Maria must keep her conservative traditional beliefs. bay in order to abstain from judging and critiquing the message her classmate is trying to convey. Tay (2020) identifies some of the effective informational listening approaches which are: Info listening. Make sure you receive the same thoughts which speakers are trying to convey. Don't judge or argue prematurely. Try to understand the speaker's ideas before judging them. Look for key ideas. Listen carefully to the speaker to find out the main ideas that he or she is trying to convey. Paraphrase. Restate in your own words the message of the speaker. Repeating the speaker's words as he or she says them will strengthen his or her message and help you to stay attentive. Gonzalez (2020) also added that informational listening helps us leam, become keener, and become better at what we do in life. Consequently, it is clear that improving skills that develop our informational listening abilities is advantageous to our lives. Other skills that help with informational listening are: Knowledge of Vocabulary. The more words we know, the more we can understand. Therefore, increasing mastery of vocabulary through techniques like leaming a new word a day or reading books can contribute in being a good informational listener. Concentration. We must know that in order to concentrate, we need to be motivated to focus, stay disciplined in the face of distractions, actively and mentally say no to distractions, and accept responsibility in getting the task at hand accomplished. Informational listening requires immense concentration. Memory. With good memory, we can recall experiences and information from our lives to help make sense of information in informational listening. Refraining from Judgment. This skill requires an open mind. If we begin judging and jumping to conclusions when attempting to properly listen and retain information, our mind will wander and possibly miss valuable pieces of information. Organization. This means identifying key concepts from auditory information and mentally organizing them into an outline so that you can better understand and remember material. Asking Questions. If listening to a panel discussion, asking mental questions to further grasp the information as the speakers are talking can mean that the listener is truly comprehending the information that is being said. Taking Notes. This is a common skill that enhances informational listening in school. One valuable tip in taking notes is to only write down key concepts and terms instead of trying to write down everything that is being said.​</h2><br />
