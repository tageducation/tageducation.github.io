                                            The Commission on Population and Development said Friday that pregnancy among 15-19-year-old women in the Philippines saw a slight decrease from 2017 to 2018—or from 182,906 to 181,717.But there is a grimmer finding: Pregnancy is on the rise among girls aged between 10 and 14—specifically, a 63-percent jump from figures in 2011 and 2018. Some 2,250 babies were born to mothers in this age group two years ago.According to the commission, there are several factors responsible for the trend observed among younger adolescents and their older counterparts. These factors are both individual and institutional.Babies having babiesAmong the individual factors are the early onset of menstruation, lack of education, and exposure to risky behaviors on the internet and among their group of friends.Meanwhile, the institutional factors include information dissemination and provision of access to family planning services.Popcom chief Juan Antonio Perez III attributes the drop in pregnancy rates among the older group to institutional work.For the 10-14-year-olds, however, greater involvement of adults and institutions may be needed. The approach should be cultural, he says.A 2016 study, “Education, Earnings and Health Effects of Teenage Pregnancy in the Philippines” by Alejandro Herrin, found that early childbearing reduces an adolescent’s future earning capacity because it diminishes the chances of completing high school.A lack of diploma results in a loss of P300 in income per day for young mothers.It is clear that the government must aggressively push for the prevention of teenage pregnancy by strategically addressing the individual factors that contribute to it. For instance, parents and schools must make themselves more aware of children’s activities in and out of the home or classroom—specifically, online and within their social circles.Risky behaviors are occasioned by lack of education and guidance, and adults must eschew the belief that not talking about sex is a way of protecting or shielding their daughters from harm. Quite the opposite, actually.Meanwhile, the government must do its part by sustaining the implementation of the Reproductive Health Law down to the community level to reach as many young people as possible.Perez, in an earlier statement, said that while the direct impact of such measures could be observed in households, they could make a dent on the macroeconomy, specifically by curbing poverty.Reduction of unplanned pregnancies translates in to family savings, which could be allocated to other items—education, healthcare, livelihood—that could be seen as improvements in the quality of life and investments for a better future.Children should enjoy their childhood and be given the opportunity to be deliberate about their life. Keeping them in the dark about the risks that lurk around them is not protecting them—it is making them vulnerable.MY REACTION______GUIDE QUESTION1.What is the editorial about?What is the stand or position of the writer regarding the issue?2.What are the pieces of evidence the support the editor's claim or position?3.Do you agree with the writer?Explain your answer.4.What is your reaction about the editorial?5.What do you think are the major considerations to note when doing a critical reading of a text like an editorial?​</a>

                            13. what is your responses in about beliefs about education​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. STUDENTS NEED TO LEARN.
</p><p>Students want and need to learn as much as they need food, clothing, and shelter. An educator's primary job is to fill that primal need for learning by creating engaging and relevant learning experiences every day. The greatest gift a teacher can give students is motivating them to experience repeated learning success.
</p><p>
</p><p>2. STUDENTS NEED TO BE ACTIVE PARTICIPANTS IN LEARNING.
</p><p>Students learn best by doing, and active teaching encourages active learning. Teachers should treat students as active participants in the learning process, providing them with skills, such as:
</p><p>
</p><p>How to study
</p><p>How to take notes
</p><p>How to memorize
</p><p>How to express themselves effectively
</p><p>These skills will help them be part of a high-performance learning team. Also, students need to be encouraged to explore and research information beyond the confines of the classroom and textbook.
</p><p>
</p><p>3. LEARNING IS A PHYSIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY INVOLVING THE WHOLE BODY.
</p><p>The best way to engage a student is to have a solid classroom management plan and a well-planned lesson that is grounded in relevant, purposeful activities designed to enhance that student's knowledge and skills and leave her or him wanting to learn more. Teachers should be strongly aligned with student-centered and student-directed learning that embraces exploration, discovery, experiential learning, and the production of academically rigorous products.
</p><p>
</p><p>4. STUDENTS NEED TIMELY FEEDBACK TO IMPROVE.
</p><p>Teachers gather data on student performance to adjust the learning environment and instruction so that they can target students' learning needs. Teachers administer pretests to find a starting point for learning and post-tests to determine the students' increase in performance level as well as the teachers' effectiveness.
</p><p>
</p><p>5. STUDENTS NEED STRUCTURE AND REPETITION TO LEARN.
</p><p>A teacher should be able to organize a standards-based lesson sequence, successfully implement the plan, and then evaluate student learning. A teacher should be able to create an exciting learning environment that makes it difficult for students to not learn. A teacher should know how to include all students in learning at their own level, and a teacher should be able to inspire the students to push themselves to the next level.
</p><p>
</p><p>6. STUDENTS NEED INFORMATION, KNOWLEDGE, AND SKILLS.
</p><p>Having access to knowledge resources is as important to a child's education as the actual curriculum content. Relevant and current information must be at the teachers' and students' fingertips to provide answers when the questions are still fresh. Information "on demand" is more valuable than information "just in case."
</p><p>
</p><p>7. STUDENTS NEED TOOLS AND RESOURCES.
</p><p>Students should know how their taxon and locale memory systems work. Students should have skills and strategies to be able to work effectively in the different levels of the cognitive domain as defined by Benjamin Bloom. Students should be aware of their own learning preferences, and teachers should assist with creating a plan to develop other learning skills. Educational tools are a means to an end. For example, technology used appropriately can greatly magnify the students' capacity to learn and the teachers' capacity to teach, inspire, and motivate.

                            15. The Commission on Population and Development said Friday that pregnancy among 15-19-year-old women in the Philippines saw a slight decrease from 2017 to 2018—or from 182,906 to 181,717.But there is a grimmer finding: Pregnancy is on the rise among girls aged between 10 and 14—specifically, a 63-percent jump from figures in 2011 and 2018. Some 2,250 babies were born to mothers in this age group two years ago.According to the commission, there are several factors responsible for the trend observed among younger adolescents and their older counterparts. These factors are both individual and institutional.Babies having babiesAmong the individual factors are the early onset of menstruation, lack of education, and exposure to risky behaviors on the internet and among their group of friends.Meanwhile, the institutional factors include information dissemination and provision of access to family planning services.Popcom chief Juan Antonio Perez III attributes the drop in pregnancy rates among the older group to institutional work.For the 10-14-year-olds, however, greater involvement of adults and institutions may be needed. The approach should be cultural, he says.A 2016 study, “Education, Earnings and Health Effects of Teenage Pregnancy in the Philippines” by Alejandro Herrin, found that early childbearing reduces an adolescent’s future earning capacity because it diminishes the chances of completing high school.A lack of diploma results in a loss of P300 in income per day for young mothers.It is clear that the government must aggressively push for the prevention of teenage pregnancy by strategically addressing the individual factors that contribute to it. For instance, parents and schools must make themselves more aware of children’s activities in and out of the home or classroom—specifically, online and within their social circles.Risky behaviors are occasioned by lack of education and guidance, and adults must eschew the belief that not talking about sex is a way of protecting or shielding their daughters from harm. Quite the opposite, actually.Meanwhile, the government must do its part by sustaining the implementation of the Reproductive Health Law down to the community level to reach as many young people as possible.Perez, in an earlier statement, said that while the direct impact of such measures could be observed in households, they could make a dent on the macroeconomy, specifically by curbing poverty.Reduction of unplanned pregnancies translates in to family savings, which could be allocated to other items—education, healthcare, livelihood—that could be seen as improvements in the quality of life and investments for a better future.Children should enjoy their childhood and be given the opportunity to be deliberate about their life. Keeping them in the dark about the risks that lurk around them is not protecting them—it is making them vulnerable.MY REACTION______GUIDE QUESTION1.What is the editorial about?What is the stand or position of the writer regarding the issue?2.What are the pieces of evidence the support the editor's claim or position?3.Do you agree with the writer?Explain your answer.4.What is your reaction about the editorial?5.What do you think are the major considerations to note when doing a critical reading of a text like an editorial?​</h2><br />
