                                            Studying MIL in the New Normal has been a practical test of how much we can utiliz new media for our good. On the other hand, this has served as a challenge for teacher and students who are experiencing digital divide. Whatever your modality is, I believ you fully understand the highs and lows of ubiquitous learning by now, and whatev may happen in the future, I believe that we are much more prepared to face it becau of what we have faced now. Do I get a thumbs up or a thumbs down? Could you share with me your person thoughts about learning MIL in the New Normal?
