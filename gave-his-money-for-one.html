                                            One evening as Shichiri Kojun was reciting sutras, a thief with a sharp sword entered, demanding either his money or his life. Shichiri told him, “Do not disturb me. You may find the money in that drawer.” Then he resumed his recitation. A little while afterward, he stopped and called: “Don’t take it all. I will need some to pay the taxes with tomorrow.”The intruder gathered up most of the money and started to leave. “Thank a person when you receive a gift,” Shichiri added. The man thanked him and made off. A few days afterward, the fellow was caught and confessed, among others, the offense against Shichiri. When Shichiri was called as a witness, he said, “This man is no thief, at least as far as I’m concerned. I gave him the money and he thanked me for it.”After he had finished his prison term, the man went to Shichiri and became his disciple.2. Which of the following presents a positive message? A.
