                                            ACTIVITY 2. READ AND LEARN LESSON FUNCTIONS OF COMMUNICATION Communication plays an important role in your life. It serves many functions in order to help you share thoughts and ideas with individuals and with groups of people. Basically, the functions of communication are as follows: control, social interaction, motivation, emotional expression, and information dissemination. 1. Every communication situation bears any of the following functions discussed below. Communication functions as a form of CONTROL. Communication helps regulate actions and behavior. A traffic enforcer calling your attention whenever you, as a pedestrian or a driver, violate traffic rules, is an example of this function. This function may likely happen whenever your parents at home or your teachers at school impose rules and regulations to follow and abide to. If you happen to violate these rules and regulations, a corresponding punishment may be given to you in order to establish the value of discipline on your part. 2. Communication functions to allow SOCIAL INTERACTION. Communication is meant for sharing and conveying messages, expressions and information. There is no better way to share your thoughts and ideas but through social interaction. This function is always present whenever you talk with your family members at home; whenever you excitedly gush about your common interests with friends; whenever you discuss about lessons with your teachers and classmates at school; and whenever you find yourself in small conversations with acquaintances or even strangers.​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Linear Model of Communication
</p><p>The first theoretical model of communication was proposed in 1949 by Shannon and Weaver for Bell Laboratories.[1] This three-part model was intended to capture the radio and television transmission process. However it was later adapted to human communication and is now known as the linear model of communication. The first part of the model is the sender, and this is the person who is speaking. The second part of the model is the channel, which is the apparatus for carrying the message (i.e., the phone or TV). The third part of the model is the receiver, and this is the person who picks up the message. In this model, communication is seen as a one-way process of transmitting a message from one person to another person. This model can be found in Figure 1.1. If you think about situations when you communicate with another person face-to-face or when you give a speech, you probably realize that this model is inadequate—communication is much more complicated than firing off a message to others.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>ou can see from this example how a topic is introduced, supported, and then brought to its natural conclusion. Yet, not all writing is academic, and once you have learned the concept behind good paragraph construction—which is really the art of focused writing in disguise—you should know that there are times when paragraph “rules” can, and should, be broken.
</p><p>
</p><p>READ: Splitting Paragraphs for Easier Reading
</p><p>
</p><p>How to write paragraphs people want to read
</p><p>The fact of the matter is that although you may have numerous valid facts or descriptions related to your paragraph’s core idea, you may lose a reader’s attention if your paragraphs are too long. What’s more, if all of your paragraphs are long, you may lose opportunities to draw your reader in. Journalists, for example, know that their readers respond better to short paragraphs. News readers generally lose interest with long descriptions and even one-sentence paragraphs are considered both acceptable and impactful.
</p><p>
</p><p>Firefighters rushed to First Avenue today to extinguish a blaze on the 1500 block. Anguished onlookers hoped that the flames would be subdued in time to rescue the building’s most prized inhabitants.
</p><p>They weren’t.
</p><p>
</p><p>The cat hospital was gone.
</p><p>
</p><p>When it comes to maintaining a reader’s attention, a good rule of thumb might be to avoid writing more than five or six sentences in a paragraph before finding a logical place to break. That said, remember that the idea behind a paragraph might be short and sweet, or it might merit deeper explanation. There are no strict rules about how many words or lines your paragraphs should be, and there’s no need to lock your doors if you occasionally write long or short ones. The grammar police aren’t coming for you.  </p><p>

It serves many functions in order to help you share thoughts and ideas with individuals and with groups of people. Basically, the functions of communication are as follows: control, social interaction, motivation, emotional expression, and information dissemination. 1. Every communication situation bears any of the following functions discussed below. Communication functions as a form of CONTROL. Communication helps regulate actions and behavior. A traffic enforcer calling your attention whenever you, as a pedestrian or a driver, violate traffic rules, is an example of this function. This function may likely happen whenever your parents at home or your teachers at school impose rules and regulations to follow and abide to. If you happen to violate these rules and regulations, a corresponding punishment may be given to you in order to establish the value of discipline on your part. 2. Communication functions to allow SOCIAL INTERACTION. Communication is meant for sharing and conveying messages, expressions and information. There is no better way to share your thoughts and ideas but through social interaction. This function is always present whenever you talk with your family members at home; whenever you excitedly gush about your common interests with friends; whenever you discuss about lessons with your teachers and classmates at school; and whenever you find yourself in small conversations with acquaintances or even strangers.​</h2><br />
