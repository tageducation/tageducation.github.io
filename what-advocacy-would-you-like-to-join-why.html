                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Before direct action comes planning, and before planning comes an understanding of what needs to be put in the plan. So first, here's a reminder of what advocacy is (as well as what it's not).</p><p></p><p>Advocacy is active promotion of a cause or principle</p><p>Advocacy involves actions that lead to a selected goal</p><p>Advocacy is one of many possible strategies, or ways to approach a problem</p><p>Advocacy can be used as part of a community initiative, nested in with other components.</p><p>Advocacy is not direct service</p><p>Advocacy does not necessarily involve confrontation or conflict.Some examples may help clarify just what advocacy is:</p><p></p><p>You join a group that helps build houses for the poor--that's wonderful, but it's not advocacy (it's a service)</p><p>You organize and agitate to get a proportion of apartments in a new development designated as low to moderate income housing - that's advocacy</p><p>You spend your Saturdays helping sort out goods at the recycling center - that's not advocacy (it's a service)</p><p>You hear that land used for the recycling center is going to be closed down and you band together with many others to get the city to preserve this site, or find you a new one. Some of you even think about blocking the bulldozers, if necessary - that's advocacy</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>First, having a strong digital self can help an individual to connect with others and build a network of contacts and relationships. This can be particularly important in today's world, where so much of our social interactions and communication take place online. A strong digital self can also help an individual to build a personal brand and establish themselves as an expert or thought leader in their field.</p><p></p><p>In terms of the community and country, a strong digital self can help to promote civic engagement and participation. By engaging with others online and participating in discussions and debates, individuals can help to shape the conversation and contribute to the collective knowledge and understanding of their community and country.</p><p></p><p>In terms of existing programs or initiatives, there are many existing programs and initiatives that support the development of strong digital selves. For example, many schools and educational institutions offer classes or workshops on digital literacy and online safety, which can help individuals to build their digital skills and knowledge. Additionally, many organizations and non-profits offer programs and resources that support individuals in building their online presence and engaging with others online.</p><p></p><p>In terms of programs that I would like to support or establish, I would like to support initiatives that focus on promoting digital literacy and online safety among young people. In particular, I would like to support programs that provide education and resources on topics such as privacy, security, and online harassment, as well as programs that teach young people how to use technology responsibly and ethically. By supporting these types of initiatives, we can help to ensure that young people are able to use technology in a way that is safe, responsible, and beneficial to themselves and their communities.</p><br />

You can build alliances with other groups and organizations to ensure that students have access to the services they require.</p><p><strong>Advocates </strong>are those who speak out for, and seek to improve the lives of those who are unable or unwilling to speak for themselves.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Planting trees is an important advocacy because trees provide numerous benefits to the environment and to people. They help to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, reduce air pollution, and provide habitat for wildlife. They also provide shade, reduce energy use in buildings, and help to prevent erosion.</p><p></p><p>2. To promote change in a community on the advocacy of planting trees, there are several actions that individuals can take. One way to promote this advocacy is to educate the community about the benefits of trees and the impact of deforestation. This can be done through social media, community events, and other forms of outreach. It may also be helpful to engage with community leaders and decision-makers to advocate for policies or initiatives that support tree planting. Other actions that can be taken include volunteering time and resources to organizations that support tree planting, participating in tree planting events and other forms of public demonstrations, and supporting businesses and organizations that promote tree planting. Additionally, individuals can contribute to the advocacy by planting trees in their own yards or in public spaces and encouraging others to do the same.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>What is Advocacy and Why Should You Care?</p><p> MDA ADMIN 04/20/2017</p><p>Advocacy Conference </p><p></p><p>Editor’s note: In advance of MDA’s first ever Advocacy Conference, taking place April 23-25, we asked several advocates to unpack the idea of advocacy: what is it, why they became advocates and why it is necessary for others to follow their examples. Their responses follow.</p><p></p><p>What does advocacy mean to you?</p><p></p><p>A big word with simple meaning. If you believe strongly in someone or something, and feel the world at large pays too little attention, it may be up to you to change the equation. When you think of human trafficking, extreme poverty, disease, lack of basic freedoms – how can everyone be too busy? – Ed Tessaro</p><p></p><p>Advocacy to me means supporting a project or cause that is important to you.  Support can be volunteering your time, working on Policy to make change at the congressional level, Fundraising to fund the project, cure or mission.  You can work full/part time, volunteer, donate, write letters to important people in the field to gain additional support and networking.  Advocacy also doesn’t always mean trying to change the regulations and laws, but working towards a solution for a need. – Michelle Erwin</p><p></p><p>Advocacy means to me: Having a strong and passionate voice. – Bridget Simpson</p><p></p><p>To me, being an advocate means, first and foremost, knowing who you are as a person and what things in life are important to you (including your needs on a daily basis). Only then can you truly be an advocate — someone who can effectively communicate to others who you are, what you need and how you want or prefer to have those needs met. This applies to medical situations (dealing with hospitals, doctors, nurses and other health professionals), educational settings, your legal rights and many other situations.  In our early years, we often don’t have all the skills needed to be the best possible advocates for ourselves and rely on parents, siblings, relatives and other people in our individual “communities of care” (i.e., support networks) to be our voices. But as we grow older, we can develop the sense of self and necessary life skills to be able to stand up for ourselves, have other people respect us and have those people work with us to have our needs and desires in life met.</p><p>– Mario Damiani</p><p></p><p>Why did you become an advocate?</p><p></p><p> </p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Information and Communications Technology (ICT) for Social Change and Women's Empowerment</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Information and Communications Technology (ICT) offers us the possibility to acquire information and to connect with other people at a speed and across distances unprecedented in history. For those without access to ICT, the knowledge and resources gap can grow exponentially. This gap, often referred to as a “digital divide,” is usually caused by poverty and lack of infrastructure. In the case of women, cultural expectations and prejudice can further exacerbate their lack of access to ICT.</p><p></p><p>WLP believes that when women and girls across the world are able to harness ICT’s potential, they improve not only their own lives but can also advance their communities through their increased levels of employment, participation in governance, and application of better information about health, safety, finance, education, childrearing, social progress, and their rights.</p><p></p><p>"ICT can enable disadvantaged individuals and communities to participate in the national and global policy decisions that can change their lives and empower them to take actions that can financially, socially, and politically benefit them."</p><p></p><p>WLP recognizes this opportunity, and uses ICT as a tool for social change and women’s empowerment. Our programs and publications increase women’s ICT skills and confidence so that they can organize, mobilize, and advocate for issues that matter to them.</p><br />

So first, here's a reminder of what advocacy is (as well as what it's not).</p><p></p><p>DOES ADVOCACY ALWAYS INVOLVE CONFRONTATION?</p><p>Advocacy can be confrontational, but conflict is usually a bad place to start. Good advocates know they must think very hard about any confrontation that's going to be necessary. That's one reason for careful planning of strategy and tactics. Even if the issue seems as clear as a bell, and your choice of actions seems just as obvious, it's a good idea to take another long, hard look.</p><p></p><p>WHY AND WHEN WOULD YOU CHOOSE ADVOCACY?</p><p>Advocacy is best kept for when "routine" work such as gathering support for a cause, raising money, and recruiting members of a community initiative or program won't get you where you want to go.</p><p></p><p>WHAT ARE THE BASIC COMPONENTS OF ADVOCACY?</p><p>Each of these components is addressed in greater depth in the following sections of this chapter, but this is a broad overview of how to advocate for your issue.</p><p></p><p>✎ Hope it's help :)</p><p>✎ ༒ |•YariClub•| ༒</p><br />
