I’ve known this since before I could go to school. As a toddler, my first study materials were a set of flash cards that my mother used to teach me the English alphabet.My mother made home conducive to learning English: all my storybooks and coloring books were in English, and so were the cartoons I watched and the music I listened to. She required me to speak English at home. She even hired tutors to help me learn to read and write in English.In school I learned to think in English. We used English to learn about numbers, equations and variables. With it we learned about observation and inference, the moon and the stars, monsoons and photosynthesis. With it we learned about shapes and colors, about meter and rhythm. I learned about God in English, and I prayed to Him in English.Filipino, on the other hand, was always the “other” subject – almost a special subject like PE or Home Economics, except that it was graded the same way as Science, Math, Religion and English. My classmates and I used to complain about Filipino all the time. Filipino was a chore, like washing the dishes; it was not the language of learning. It was the language we used to speak to the people who washed our dishes.We used to think learning Filipino was important because it was practical: Filipino was the language of the world outside the classroom. It was the language of the streets: it was how you spoke to the tindera when you went to the tindahan, what you used to tell your katulong that you had an utos, and how you texted manong when you needed “sundo na" These skills were required to survive in the outside world, because we are forced to relate with the tinderas and the manongs and the katulongs of this world. If we wanted to communicate to these people – or otherwise avoid being mugged on the jeepney – we needed to learn Filipino.That being said though, I was proud of my proficiency with the language. Filipino was the language I used to speak with my cousins and uncles and grandparents in the province, so I never had much trouble reciting.It was the reading and writing that was tedious and difficult. I spoke Filipino, but only when I was in a different world like the streets or the province; it did not come naturally to me. English was more natural; I read, wrote and thought in English. And so, in much of the same way that I learned German later on, I learned Filipino in terms of English. In this way I survived Filipino in high school, albeit with too many sentences that had the preposition “ay.”It was really only in university that I began to grasp Filipino in terms of language and not just dialect. Filipino was not merely a peculiar variety of language, derived and continuously borrowing from the English and Spanish alphabets; it was its own system, with its own grammar, semantics, sounds, even symbols.But more significantly, it was its own way of reading, writing and thinking. There are ideas and concepts unique to Filipino that can never be translated into another. Try translating bayanihan, tagay, kilig or diskarte.Only recently have I begun to grasp Filipino as the language of identity: the language of emotion, experience, and even of learning. And with this comes the realization that I do, in fact, smell worse than a malansang isda. My own language is foreign to me: I speak, think, read and write primarily in English. To borrow the terminology of Fr. Bulatao, I am a split-level Filipino.But perhaps this is not so bad in a society of rotten beef and stinking fish. For while Filipino may be the language of identity, it is the language of the streets. It might have the capacity to be the language of learning, but it is not the language of the learned.
It is neither the language of the classroom and the laboratory, nor the language of the boardroom, the court room, or the operating room. It is not the language of privilege. I may be disconnected from my being Filipino, but with a tongue of privilege I will always have my connections.So, I have my education to thank for making English mother touge Main PointsTextual EvidenceFact or Opinion1.2.3.4.5.1.2.3.4.5.1.2.3.4​</a>

Certainly, I have no opportunities to meet with friends and re atives but have been keeping in touch with them through phone calls and social media.

Although the pandemic is still going on. I can still find ways to keep myself active. Meanwhile, it is the best time to make use of the internet to keep connected with my friends and relatives and to continue learning. There are abundant leaming resources out there.

COVID-19 is caused by infection with anew coronavirus (called SARS-CoV-2). Most people infected with theCOVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness andrecover without requiring special treatment. Older people and those withunderlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronicrespiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.On the other hand flu is caused by infection with influenza viruses.Symptoms can be mild to severe. The most common symptoms include: highfever, runny nose, sore throat, muscle and joint pain, headache, coughing, andfeeling tired. These symptoms typically begin two days after exposure to thevirus and most last less than a week. The cough, however, may last for morethan two weeks. In children, there may be diarrhea and vomiting, but these arenot common in adults. Diarrhea and vomiting occur more commonly ingastroenteritis, which is an unrelated disease and sometimes inaccuratelyreferred to as "stomach flu" or the "24-hour flu". Complications of influenzamay include viral pneumonia, secondary bacterial pneumonia, sinus infections,and worsening of previous health problems such as asthma or heart failure.Because some of the symptoms of flu and COVID-19 are similar, itmay be hard to tell the difference between them based on symptoms alone, andtesting may be needed to help confirm a diagnosis. Flu and COVID-19 sharemany characteristics, but there are some key differences between the two.help me PLSSS​</a>

The whole village was tired of him; he was always gloomy, he constantly complained and was always in a bad mood. The longer he lived, the more bile he was becoming and the more poisonous were his words. People avoided him, because his misfortune became contagious. It was even unnatural and insulting to be happy next to him. He created the feeling of unhappiness in others. But one day, when he turned eighty years old, an incredible thing happened. Instantly everyone started hearing the rumour: "An Old Man is happy today, he doesn't complain about anything, smiles, and even his face is freshened up." The whole village gathered together. The old man was asked: Villager: What happened to you? "Nothing special. Eighty years I've been chasing happiness, and it was useless. And then I decided to live without happiness and just enjoy life. That's why I'm happy now." - An Old Man Facilitating Activities Activity 1. Complete me!

HerbosaFactors thatAffect theselectionwrittenI'm in the car, in a foreign country, 10,000 miles from home, feeling lost.My delegation and I were the only ones who spoke Filipino. It was really sunnyThursday, 3rd of July, 7:30 in the morning. I looked outside seeing jet planes flyout of Brussels International Airport. The people inside the car, aside from mydelegation, were Simon, an 11 year old kid, Freya, his sister, and their mom, whoonly spoke English the best.In Belguim, French and Dutch languages are spoken. In the Northern partof Belguim, also known as Flanders, people speak Dutch and in the southern part,in the region called Wallonia, they speak French. I thought how amazing it is fortwo totally different languages to be spoken in one country.Being in a different country makes me feel more proud to be Filipino. Thefact that we were sent as delegates from our country made the feeling morespecial. This exciting learning experience allowed me to recall my school trainingof being committed to excellence, competent, and proud Filipino. My goodeducation brought me here, and this is where I would want to serve mycountrymen.I met people of many races. I made friends with Lebanese kids - Husseinand Ramzi and German kids - Johan and Freddy who were really kind. I expectedthem to be really energetic, but they were quiet and shy the whole morning.Meeting people from different regions of the earth is just a rare opportunity that iswhy; I made the first move and befriended them.We were all welcomed by our host families. A host family is a family where youwould stay before your camp for three days. On the final day, campers were in a"Village," the camp as others call it.The first day went really fast. Before I knew it, it was 8:30 in the evening. It didn'tfeel that it was night, because the sun was still up. It's really incredible that a partof the world is still sunny even though it is nighttime already. Before I closed myeyes, 1 silently prayed to God for Him to guide me and my loved ones whom !have left behind in my home country.We had an "Earth Ceremony." In this rite, we had to bring soil from our countryand put it in a basin, and mix it. It represents our unity and our love for our MotherEarth​</a>

But even Sara's mom cannot find cure for the coronavirus. “What does COVID-19 look like?- Sarah asked her mom. "COVID-19 or the Corona virus is very tiny, we can't see it," said her mom." But it spreads in the coughs and sneezes of people who are sick and when they touch people or things around them. People who are sick get a fever and cough and can have some trouble in breathing “So, we can't fight it because we can't see it, Sara asked, "We can fight it, Sara's mom answered. The virus affects many kinds of people and everyone can help fight it. Children are special and they can help too. You need to stay safe for all of us. I need you to be my hero." "Heroes have superpowers”. She said to herself closing her eyes to sleep. "I need a way to tell all children in the world how to protect everyone else, Sarah said. "I need something that can fly, something with a big voice and something that can help!" she added. Suddenly a shadow appeared in front of her. What are you? asked Sara "I'm Pedro, a flying Pegasus," it replied. "I never seen a Pegasus before. Sara whispered. “Maybe if I have you, I can tell all the children in the world about Coronavirus," said Sara. "Yes sure. Nothing can harm you when we're together," replied Pedro. Sara jumped on Pedro's back and together they soared out through her bedroom window, into the night sky. They flew towards the stars and said hello to the moon. They talked to different people around the world and told them the things they need to do to avoid spreading of coronavirus. “Wash your hands with soap and water. Instead of shaking hands, we wave to people. We try to stay inside especially for crowded city. People must stop travelling and should closed the boarders across the world. Stay at least one meter apart from each other. Isolate yourself if you are not feeling well. We should not stop taking care of one another. “Sara said. "We can do things for each other," Pedro added. Sarah fell asleep and when she woke up the next day, Pedro was gone. Sara ran to her mom with her drawing to tell her the news. “There are many heroes keeping people safe from the Corona virus, like wonderful doctors and nurses. But you remind me that we can all be heroes every day," Sara's mom said. 1. What is Sara's mom's profession? 2. What causes people to get sick? 3.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Being Special
<p>
Me and other people are special because there are no two same persons in this world – even if they are twins! It does not matter if the twins look similar physically, because deep inside, they could have different personalities.
</p><p>
Another thing that could make you special is your unique abilities. If you are born with a talent, learn how to use it to your advantage. If you are good in singing or dancing, try to practice and develop a higher level of skill. In the long run, your unique set of talents will eventually turn you into a special individual admired by a lot of people.

I’ve known this since before I could go to school. As a toddler, my first study materials were a set of flash cards that my mother used to teach me the English alphabet.My mother made home conducive to learning English: all my storybooks and coloring books were in English, and so were the cartoons I watched and the music I listened to. She required me to speak English at home. She even hired tutors to help me learn to read and write in English.In school I learned to think in English. We used English to learn about numbers, equations and variables. With it we learned about observation and inference, the moon and the stars, monsoons and photosynthesis. With it we learned about shapes and colors, about meter and rhythm. I learned about God in English, and I prayed to Him in English.Filipino, on the other hand, was always the “other” subject – almost a special subject like PE or Home Economics, except that it was graded the same way as Science, Math, Religion and English. My classmates and I used to complain about Filipino all the time. Filipino was a chore, like washing the dishes; it was not the language of learning. It was the language we used to speak to the people who washed our dishes.We used to think learning Filipino was important because it was practical: Filipino was the language of the world outside the classroom. It was the language of the streets: it was how you spoke to the tindera when you went to the tindahan, what you used to tell your katulong that you had an utos, and how you texted manong when you needed “sundo na" These skills were required to survive in the outside world, because we are forced to relate with the tinderas and the manongs and the katulongs of this world. If we wanted to communicate to these people – or otherwise avoid being mugged on the jeepney – we needed to learn Filipino.That being said though, I was proud of my proficiency with the language. Filipino was the language I used to speak with my cousins and uncles and grandparents in the province, so I never had much trouble reciting.It was the reading and writing that was tedious and difficult. I spoke Filipino, but only when I was in a different world like the streets or the province; it did not come naturally to me. English was more natural; I read, wrote and thought in English. And so, in much of the same way that I learned German later on, I learned Filipino in terms of English. In this way I survived Filipino in high school, albeit with too many sentences that had the preposition “ay.”It was really only in university that I began to grasp Filipino in terms of language and not just dialect. Filipino was not merely a peculiar variety of language, derived and continuously borrowing from the English and Spanish alphabets; it was its own system, with its own grammar, semantics, sounds, even symbols.But more significantly, it was its own way of reading, writing and thinking. There are ideas and concepts unique to Filipino that can never be translated into another. Try translating bayanihan, tagay, kilig or diskarte.Only recently have I begun to grasp Filipino as the language of identity: the language of emotion, experience, and even of learning. And with this comes the realization that I do, in fact, smell worse than a malansang isda. My own language is foreign to me: I speak, think, read and write primarily in English. To borrow the terminology of Fr. Bulatao, I am a split-level Filipino.But perhaps this is not so bad in a society of rotten beef and stinking fish. For while Filipino may be the language of identity, it is the language of the streets. It might have the capacity to be the language of learning, but it is not the language of the learned.
It is neither the language of the classroom and the laboratory, nor the language of the boardroom, the court room, or the operating room. It is not the language of privilege. I may be disconnected from my being Filipino, but with a tongue of privilege I will always have my connections.So, I have my education to thank for making English mother touge Main PointsTextual EvidenceFact or Opinion1.2.3.4.5.1.2.3.4.5.1.2.3.4​</h2><br />

COVID-19 is caused by infection with anew coronavirus (called SARS-CoV-2). Most people infected with theCOVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness andrecover without requiring special treatment. Older people and those withunderlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronicrespiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.On the other hand flu is caused by infection with influenza viruses.Symptoms can be mild to severe. The most common symptoms include: highfever, runny nose, sore throat, muscle and joint pain, headache, coughing, andfeeling tired. These symptoms typically begin two days after exposure to thevirus and most last less than a week. The cough, however, may last for morethan two weeks. In children, there may be diarrhea and vomiting, but these arenot common in adults. Diarrhea and vomiting occur more commonly ingastroenteritis, which is an unrelated disease and sometimes inaccuratelyreferred to as "stomach flu" or the "24-hour flu".

The longer he lived, the more bile he was becoming and the more poisonous were his words. People avoided him, because his misfortune became contagious.

                            23. In a Different Time ZoneRegino Costantino F. HerbosaFactors thatAffect theselectionwrittenI'm in the car, in a foreign country, 10,000 miles from home, feeling lost.My delegation and I were the only ones who spoke Filipino. It was really sunnyThursday, 3rd of July, 7:30 in the morning. I looked outside seeing jet planes flyout of Brussels International Airport. The people inside the car, aside from mydelegation, were Simon, an 11 year old kid, Freya, his sister, and their mom, whoonly spoke English the best.In Belguim, French and Dutch languages are spoken. In the Northern partof Belguim, also known as Flanders, people speak Dutch and in the southern part,in the region called Wallonia, they speak French. I thought how amazing it is fortwo totally different languages to be spoken in one country.Being in a different country makes me feel more proud to be Filipino. Thefact that we were sent as delegates from our country made the feeling morespecial. This exciting learning experience allowed me to recall my school trainingof being committed to excellence, competent, and proud Filipino. My goodeducation brought me here, and this is where I would want to serve mycountrymen.I met people of many races. I made friends with Lebanese kids - Husseinand Ramzi and German kids - Johan and Freddy who were really kind. I expectedthem to be really energetic, but they were quiet and shy the whole morning.Meeting people from different regions of the earth is just a rare opportunity that iswhy; I made the first move and befriended them.We were all welcomed by our host families. A host family is a family where youwould stay before your camp for three days. On the final day, campers were in a"Village," the camp as others call it.The first day went really fast. Before I knew it, it was 8:30 in the evening. It didn'tfeel that it was night, because the sun was still up. It's really incredible that a partof the world is still sunny even though it is nighttime already. Before I closed myeyes, 1 silently prayed to God for Him to guide me and my loved ones whom !have left behind in my home country.We had an "Earth Ceremony." In this rite, we had to bring soil from our countryand put it in a basin, and mix it. It represents our unity and our love for our MotherEarth​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>It's important to remember that not everyone will like us, and that's okay. It's not helpful to assume that people are treating you poorly because of your appearance. Instead, try to focus on the positive aspects of your life and the people who do appreciate and support you. It's also important to remember that being kind and compassionate towards others can go a long way in building positive relationships and making people like you.</p><p></p><p><strong>You are wrong.

They talked to different people around the world and told them the things they need to do to avoid spreading of coronavirus. “Wash your hands with soap and water. Instead of shaking hands, we wave to people. We try to stay inside especially for crowded city. People must stop travelling and should closed the boarders across the world. Stay at least one meter apart from each other. Isolate yourself if you are not feeling well. We should not stop taking care of one another. “Sara said. "We can do things for each other," Pedro added. Sarah fell asleep and when she woke up the next day, Pedro was gone. Sara ran to her mom with her drawing to tell her the news. “There are many heroes keeping people safe from the Corona virus, like wonderful doctors and nurses.
