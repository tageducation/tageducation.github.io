                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>During the 20th century there was a</p><p></p><p>large increase in the variety of music</p><p></p><p>that people had access to. Prior to the</p><p></p><p>invention of mass market gramophone</p><p></p><p>records (developed in 1892) and radio</p><p></p><p>broadcasting (first commercially done</p><p></p><p>ca. 1919–20), people mainly listened to</p><p></p><p>music at live Classical music concerts</p><p></p><p>or musical theatre shows, which were</p><p></p><p>too expensive for many working class</p><p></p><p>people; on early phonograph players (a</p><p></p><p>technology invented in 1877 which was</p><p></p><p>not mass-marketed until the mid-1890s);</p><p></p><p>or by individuals performing music or</p><p></p><p>singing songs on an amateur basis at</p><p></p><p>home, using sheet music, which required</p><p></p><p>the ability to sing, play, and read music.</p><p></p><p>These were skills that tended to be</p><p></p><p>limited to middle-class and upper-class</p><p></p><p>individuals. With the mass-market</p><p></p><p>availability of gramophone records</p><p></p><p>and radio broadcasts, listeners could</p><p></p><p>purchase recordings of, or listen on radio</p><p></p><p>to recordings or live broadcasts of a</p><p></p><p>huge variety of songs and musical pieces</p><p></p><p>from around the globe. This enabled a</p><p></p><p>much wider range of the population to</p><p></p><p>listen to performances of Classical music</p><p></p><p>symphonies and operas that they would</p><p></p><p>not be able to hear live, either due to not</p><p></p><p>being able to afford live-concert tickets or</p><p></p><p>because such music was not performed</p><p></p><p>in their region.</p><p></p><p>Sound recording was also a major</p><p></p><p>influence on the development of popular</p><p></p><p>music genres, because it enabled</p><p></p><p>recordings of songs and bands to be</p><p></p><p>inexpensive and widely distributed</p><p></p><p>nationwide or even, for some artists,</p><p></p><p>worldwide.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>PERFORMING MEDIUM: Performing groups during this era include chamber orchestras; instrumental ensembles; orchestras; choral groups; computer generated instruments (including synthesizers); and mixed media (taped sounds with traditional instruments).</p><p></p><p>RHYTHM: Complex, individual rhythms are used, and new rhythms and meters are common such as polyrhythms and polymeters.</p><p></p><p>MELODY: Melodies are often fragmented, dissonant and experimental. Depending on the form or style used, melodies could be based on scales from non-Western countries, chromatic scales, twelve-tone rows, or microtonal scales.</p><p></p><p>HARMONY: Harmony is often experimental and dissonant. Instead of all harmony being based on the interval of a third (tertian harmony, used in much of Western tonal music), harmony is sometimes based on seconds, fourths and fifths (respectively, secondal, quartal, and quintal harmony). Atonality, meaning an absence of tonality, is present in music such as twelve-tone compositions.</p><p></p><p>TEXTURE: Polyphonic textures are often used (twelve-tone music often uses homophonic texture), and music such as impressionism or aleatory music experiment with new textures using layers of different sounds.</p><p></p><p>FORM: Musical forms from previous musical periods are used, often in experimental ways.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Source: https://www.violinonline.com/unit5_2.html</p><p></p><br />

                        <p>During the 20th century, social changes combined with new technologies created a mass market for popular music and contributed to how music was created, shared, and appreciated. The advancement of technology had a huge impact on the evolution of music. Twentieth century music is very different than the music of previous centuries because musicians had more freedom to be creative. Musicians were very open to change and incorporated many aspects of the African culture. African music had a big influence on 20th century music, quickly became part of American culture, and helped lead to the creation of some of the genres now recognized as jazz, rhythm and blues, and rock and roll.</p><p>The early twentieth century saw a rise in popularity of jazz. It was a new kind of music that evolved in New Orleans. “Jazz is the product of many cultures and influences” (7). Jazz has its roots from “West African music, black folk and religious forms developed in the New World, and European popular and light classical music of the 18th and 19th centuries.” (Jazz..). Jazz evolved from African chants and spirituals. It is music with a history and is very deeply engrained in American culture. Jazz music is usually played with the trumpet, saxophone, trombone, piano, and/or guitar. The most famous of the jazz musicians was Louis Armstrong. He was a trumpeter, composer, and singer. His first record was made in Chicago in the 1920s.</p><br />

                            21. why do musical styles of 20th century truly unique and innovativeessay po yan:)​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer: 20th century music</strong></p><p>During the 20th century there was a large increase in the variety of music that people had access to. Prior to the invention of mass market gramophone records (developed in 1892) and radio broadcasting (first commercially done ca. 1919–20), people mainly listened to music at live classical music concerts or musical theatre shows; informally at music halls, or in pubs and fairs; on early phonograph players (a technology invented in 1877 which was not mass-marketed until the mid-1890s); or by individuals performing music or singing songs on an amateur basis at home, sometimes using sheet music. The ability to read music or play certain instruments and classical styles of music tended to be limited to middle-class and upper-class individuals, while singing and performing folk music and work songs was mainly limited to working class people. With the mass-market availability of gramophone records and radio broadcasts, listeners could purchase recordings of, or listen on radio to recordings or live broadcasts of a huge variety of songs and musical pieces from around the globe. This enabled a much wider range of the population to listen to performances of classical and popular music, including symphonies, operas, and folk music, that they would not normally hear live, either due to not being able to afford live-concert tickets or because such music was not performed in their region or social class.
</p><p>
</p><p>Sound recording was also a major influence on the development of popular music genres, because it enabled recordings of songs and bands to be inexpensively and widely distributed nationwide or even, for some artists, worldwide. The development of relatively inexpensive reproduction of music via a succession of formats including vinyl records, compact cassettes, compact discs (introduced in 1983) and, by the mid-1990s, digital audio recordings, and the transmission or broadcast of audio recordings of music performances on radio, of video recordings or live performances on television, and by the 1990s, of audio and video recordings via the Internet, using file sharing of digital audio recordings, gave individuals from a wide range of socioeconomic classes access to a diverse selection of high-quality music performances by artists from around the world.[1] The introduction of multitrack recording in 1955 and the use of mixing had a major influence on pop and rock music, because it enabled record producers to mix and overdub many layers of instrument tracks and vocals, creating new sounds that would not be possible in a live performance.[2] The development of sound recording and audio engineering technologies and the ability to edit these recordings gave rise to new subgenres of classical music, including the Musique concrète (1949) and acousmatic[3] (1955) schools of electronic composition.
</p><p>
</p><p>In Beethoven's and Felix Mendelssohn's time in the 19th century, the orchestra was composed of a fairly standard core of instruments which was very rarely modified. As time progressed, and as the Romantic period saw changes in accepted modification with composers such as Berlioz and Mahler, the 20th century saw that instrumentation could practically be hand-picked by the composer. Saxophones were used in some 20th-century orchestra scores such as Vaughan Williams' Symphonies No.6 and 9 and William Walton's Belshazzar's Feast, and many other works as a member of the orchestral ensemble. Twentieth-century orchestras generally include a string section, woodwinds, brass instruments, percussion, piano, celeste, harp(s),[4] with other instruments called for occasionally, such as electric guitar[5] and electric bass.[6]
</p><p>
</p><p>The 20th century saw dramatic innovations in musical forms and styles. Composers and songwriters explored new forms and sounds that challenged the previously accepted rules of music of earlier periods, such as the use of altered chords and extended chords in 1940s-era Bebop jazz. The development of powerful, loud guitar amplifiers and sound reinforcement systems in the 1960s and 1970s permitted bands to hold large concerts where even those with the least expensive tickets could hear the show. Composers and songwriters experimented with new musical styles, such as genre fusions (e.g., the late 1960s fusion of jazz and rock music to create jazz fusion). As well, composers and musicians used new electric, electronic, and digital instruments and musical devices.</p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Noisemakers were introduced to make 20th-century music's tone color richer and more intriguing. New chord structures were adopted, and the harmonies became more discordant. Tonality was less important to composers, and some entirely ignored it. Music became more unpredictable as rhythms were broadened and melodies made bigger jumps. Musical styles diverged in ways they had never done before in the twentieth century. During this century, aleatory, atonality, serialism, musique concrète, electronic music, and concept music were all developed.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>During the 20th century, social changes combined with new technologies created a mass market for popular music and contributed to how music was created, shared, and appreciated. The advancement of technology had a huge impact on the evolution of music. Twentieth century music is very different than the music of previous centuries because musicians had more freedom to be creative. Musicians were very open to change and incorporated many aspects of the African culture. African music had a big influence on 20th century music, quickly became part of American culture, and helped lead to the creation of some of the genres now recognized as jazz, rhythm and blues, and rock and roll.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>20th century is an era of varied musical styles.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>20th-century classical music describes art music that was written nominally from 1901 to 2000, inclusive. Musical style diverged during the 20th century as it never had previously. Consequently, this century was without a dominant style. Modernism, impressionism, and post-romanticism can all be traced to the decades before the turn of the century, but can be included because they evolved beyond the musical boundaries of the 19th-century styles that were part of the earlier common practice period. Neoclassicism and expressionism came mostly after 1900. Minimalism started much later in the century and can be seen as a change from the modern to post-modern era, although some date post-modernism from as early as ca. 1930. Aleatory, atonality, serialism, musique concrète, electronic music, and concept music were all developed during this century. Jazz and ethnic folk music became important influences on many composers during this century.</p><br />
