________1. A research title capsulizes the main thought or idea of the whole research paper and it also
reflects the variables under study.
________2. In writing the significance of the study, the researcher should start from specific to general
contribution.
________ 3. Controversial topic should be avoided in writing a research paper because it is prone to
opinions of the subject.
________ 4. You can narrow down the topic by exploring and extending the explanation of a theory and
by focusing on a specific group.
________ 5. A research question should not be answerable with a simple ‘yes’ or ‘no’, but rather
requires synthesis and analysis of ideas and sources prior to composition of an answer.
________ 6. In writing the title of a qualitative research, it is always necessary to complete all the data
that answers what, where, who, and when even though it’s too long.
_________7. A research question should be arguable. Its potential answers are open to debate rather
than accepted facts.
________ 8. Research is usually limited in scope by sample size, time and geographic area; while the
delimitation of study is the description of the scope of study.
_________9. Research titles that start with indefinite adjectives such as several, many, some, etc., make
the topic vague.
________ 10. Your problem statement can guide you in identifying the specific contribution of your study.</a>

When a famous athlete is shown recommending a brand of shoes, the technique used is testimonial 4. Bandwagon is a propaganda technique which tries to persuade you by repeating certain words or ideas. 5. The statement, "He has achieved at least 96% in every test completed in Math" shows a fact. 6. The statement, "Studies show that students who read outside of school outperform their classmates on standardized tests", states an opinion. 7. Facts that are not verified also make good evidence. 8. Without evidence to support your claim, any statements you make will have little or no value. 9. Scholarly articles are samples of a weak source where evidence in a text can be obtained. 10. It is not highly necessary to determine the credentials of the person or source responsible for the evidence in a certain piece of writing. 11. Evidence found in primary sources such as literary works, historical documents, photos, and biographies is always valid regardless of the time when it was published. 12. It is important to recognize fallacy in an argument so that we can identify what to believe or not and state our reasons why we have come up with the decision made.​</a>
