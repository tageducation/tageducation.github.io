Good Day to the people of OLONGAPO City, I know that we are all worried because of the corona virus or what we call COVID 19. I understand your anxiety but this is not the time to panic. First of all, I want you to know that your government, both national and local, each department of the government here in OLONGAPO City, is working hard to monitor and fight the corona virus. You can count on it that we will give you all the necessary information that we can get, we will give it to you because that is your privilege. I want to inform the people of OLONGAPO City, that based on the findings, definitely the spread of corona virus is not airborne, meaning to say when someone coughs, sneezes or if your hands are not clean, that is when the virus transfers, you need not worry if you’re inside a room with someone who has a possibility to have corona virus, it doesn’t mean to say that you might acquire the virus, In addition to this, face mask is essential, but it is more important to always wash your hands and observe proper hygiene , although of course, some of you would still want to use face mask, it is also good for you, it will give you peace of mind as well, those who would like to have face mask we are giving free mask in the city hall of OLONGAPO . I want you prices, the masks, and the alcohol. We are also monitoring the hospital, and city health, these facilities are both ready if ever there is a need to take an action. Do not worry, we are together against this pandemic. My last call is that let’s trust and help one another. I would also like to call the attention of those who are not feeling well, do not be afraid to go to your nearest station, we got a lot of stations here where you can when the need requires it. We are just here if you are sick, do not worry, we are going to help you, together, and we will help each other for you to recover so that we could avoid infecting others. Let us help and trust each other, I know we can overcome this pandemic, the Philippines and the whole world. God Bless OLONGAPO ! God Bless everyone! Everyone, please stay safe. THANK YOU!

Interesting information is little detail or additional detail, which could be a cool fact, distractor, or less important concept, that is present in the article. 4. Filtering means selecting only the information necessary to better understand the selection that you are listening to. 5. Everything presented by an author is of equal importance. 6. In narrative genres, determining importance asks the reader to identify main ideas and infer themes of the story. 7. Listening enables you to process the information, evaluate it, make sense of it, and respond to it whether it would be helpful for you or not-essential or not. 8. Listening would not help you make sound conclusions and/or generalizations based on given data. 9. When listening to the text presented, you need to concentrate and pay attention. 10.

Good Day to the people of OLONGAPO City, I know that we are all worried because of the corona virus or what we call COVID 19. I understand your anxiety but this is not the time to panic.

You can count on it that we will give you all the necessary information that we can get, we will give it to you because that is your privilege. I want to inform the people of OLONGAPO City, that based on the findings, definitely the spread of corona virus is not airborne, meaning to say when someone coughs, sneezes or if your hands are not clean, that is when the virus transfers, you need not worry if you’re inside a room with someone who has a possibility to have corona virus, it doesn’t mean to say that you might acquire the virus, In addition to this, face mask is essential, but it is more important to always wash your hands and observe proper hygiene , although of course, some of you would still want to use face mask, it is also good for you, it will give you peace of mind as well, those who would like to have face mask we are giving free mask in the city hall of OLONGAPO . I want you prices, the masks, and the alcohol. We are also monitoring the hospital, and city health, these facilities are both ready if ever there is a need to take an action. Do not worry, we are together against this pandemic. My last call is that let’s trust and help one another. I would also like to call the attention of those who are not feeling well, do not be afraid to go to your nearest station, we got a lot of stations here where you can when the need requires it. We are just here if you are sick, do not worry, we are going to help you, together, and we will help each other for you to recover so that we could avoid infecting others. Let us help and trust each other, I know we can overcome this pandemic, the Philippines and the whole world. God Bless OLONGAPO ! God Bless everyone! Everyone, please stay safe. THANK YOU!

                            28. Write TRUE if the statement is correct about determining the worth of ideas and FALSE if not.1. Determining the worth of ideas simple means focusing on what is significant on  the information you have listened to. 2. Important information refers to main ideas or key topics that you need to better understand the concept you are listening to. 3. Interesting information is little detail or additional detail, which could be a cool fact, distractor, or less important concept, that is present in the article. 4. Filtering means selecting only the information necessary to better understand the selection that you are listening to. 5. Everything presented by an author is of equal importance. 6. In narrative genres, determining importance asks the reader to identify main ideas and infer themes of the story. 7. Listening enables you to process the information, evaluate it, make sense of it, and respond to it whether it would be helpful for you or not-essential or not. 8. Listening would not help you make sound conclusions and/or generalizations based on given data. 9. When listening to the text presented, you need to concentrate and pay attention. 10. Knowing how to determine the importance of ideas that you have listened to is necessary because it would not only assist you in understanding better the text, but it would also help you master concepts and skills.​</h2><br />
