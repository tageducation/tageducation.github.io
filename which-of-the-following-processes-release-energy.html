                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>C</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Chemical reactions that release energy are called exothermic. In exothermic reactions, more energy is released when the bonds are formed in the products than is used to break the bonds in the reactants. Exothermic reactions are accompanied by an increase in temperature of the reaction mixture.</p><br />
