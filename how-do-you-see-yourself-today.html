What would they see? 4. Exceptions to the Problem &amp; Competencies When are the times that "the problem is not such a problem? What is different? When does the problem" not bother you so much? How have you managed so far to deal with the problem" What has helped so far? Even if it has been just a little help. How have you found the courage to deal with this problem? 5. Scaling On a scale of 10 to 0, where 10 means your hope and goal has come true and O is the worst you can imagine, what number are you now? How will you know you have moved up one number?

He called his children to bid them farewell. All of them came but Bighari, the Goddess of Flowers.	Bathala, who valued promptness, became angry because this was not the first time that Bighari missed their gathering. Thus, he banished her from heavenly kingdom.	At that time, Bighari was at her garden on Earth. She wept bitterly when she was told of her banishment, but she sought to cope with her sorrow by causing her garden to bloom profusely.	The legend of the rainbow says that the people that used to live around her garden grew to love her more and more for bringing beauty to their lives. They resolved, after a time, to build her a bower so that they could see her garden even from a long distance. 	And so, they built it. And decked it all over with colorful blooms. Thereafter, whenever Bighari would travel, people would see her colorful bower against the sky.1. Who visited the Earth? __________________________2.

                                             ,       Aren’t you tired of pretending that you are okay? Honey, it is okay to feel sad, that is part of our life. You always concealed your emotions through smiling. Does pretending can make you feel that you are okay?     And sweetie, aren’t u tired of saying that you are okay? If you wanna cry then let it flow. Cry as hard as you want but make sure that once you stop crying, you’ll also let your heart become well. It is okay not to be okay but wanna know what is not okay? Forcing yourself that you are, even if you are not. And this is an open letter for you.       You are a soldier because you are strong. You are beautiful because you are you. Do not compare yourself to others because you are unique and honey, it is okay to feel sad because you are still alive and that’s life.      Stop pretending that you aren’t hurt, be true to yourself and stop covering what you really feel.      I wrote this because I want you to feel that you are enough and if ever someone let you feel that you aren’t, I just want to say that I am proud of you and you are more than enough.       No matter how hard it is just kept on going in life. If you aren’t okay today, just keep on fighting until you reach the end. You’ll be okay, maybe not now but soon. I have a trust on you and I hope you will make yourself okay.    If crying doesn't make you feel okay. Accept everything that has been done, move forward and see the beauty in life.      To all ladies and men, if ever you read this one. I just want to remind you that if you are in pain or suffering right now. I am with you, God is with you, and you have yourself.       ’  , ..                                               yours truly,                                               the one who                                               experienced                                               pain but now                                               totally healed.​</a>

What you see in the mirror is exactly what you see, what you get, and what you are. Again, the question is who you are. This poses you to rediscover who you truly are and how to reveal, Predefine, and reactivate yourself again.To turn to your original condition, every time you broke your inner senses, every time you were struck by your fears, every time you lost courage and hope, and every time you failed. Blindfolded with all the shams and drudgeries in life, we are curtailed to bring out the best in us. The challenge is there all the time, put your blindfolded off, for this is just a test of life. Remembering and believing who we are,. is just the start of living life to the fullest again this is the first step. Next is to live the truth. You are created for a purpose and thus loved by God. With this, you will experience healing inside and your completeness through Him will then radiate love and joy to others too. No philosophers, even the best ones can give us the best ways to overcome our personal challenges. It is just our relationship with God. The best system is prayer. When you ray, you talk to God and your journey with Him will take place. It is our pause from time to time that we will be refreshed with something new, something better, a fresh start, a clean state, and a new journey to begin again. We can choose differently! Remember, what matters most is not how others see you, but how you truly see yourself. Who are you when you are all alone? When no one is watching? How do you see yourself determines how you allow people to treat you? How you see yourself dictates what you expect from others, from life, from God. Choose today to be the greatest version of yourself. Do not forget to wear the best make-up SMILE, and the world will smile at you.Eden Grace C.

                                            Instruction: Congratulations for making it this far! You’re almost done. Before you proceed to your next lesson, let us test your mastery. Today’s task is to read the following paragraphs and determine which pattern of development in writing is used. Are you ready? Here are the paragraphs. 1. Caring for yourself during these times is also caring for others. When we are allowed to go outside our houses, we should obey health practices. Some are skeptic about wearing masks. Others are still in doubt when asked to wash hands often or use alcohol and sanitizer. There are also people who question the need to maintain distance from each other in public areas. These safety measures are set because they are proven to be helpful in preventing the spread of the virus. They are not mere wishes to make our lives difficult. We are asked to do these health protocols because we are still in danger with the rising number of COVID-19 cases. Be responsible for yourself so that you will not be the reason for others to catch the virus. If you care for your loved ones, you must take care of yourself first. You do not want to be the one bringing the virus to your home. 2. The word quarantine is such a familiar one to almost everyone who are aware of the pandemic today. According to the Merriam- Webster dictionary online, it is a noun that has several meanings. It states that it is a period of 40 days. It may also be a term during which a ship arriving in port and suspected of carrying contagious disease is held in isolation from the shore. Also, it means a restraint upon the activities or communication of persons or the transport of goods designed to prevent the spread of disease or pests. It is also defined as a state of enforced isolation. For us, who have been in community quarantine for more or less three months, we know that quarantine means staying at home and waiting for the situation to be better. It is a condition wherein only those who have quarantine pass are allowed to go out for essential needs of the family. For others, the concept quarantine may also be equated to “no work, no pay” policy. Some may define it as something needed for people who are sick or those who came from places with COVID-19 cases. On the other hand, some probably sees quarantine as something that takes away their right to see family, relatives and friends. To sum it up, whatever or however we understand quarantine, we need to follow it as a safety protocol since we are still fighting this pandemic. 3. There are several similarities and differences between being a senior and junior high school student. Being a senior and junior high school student, both require you to study hard to be able to get desirable outputs and decent grades. Subjects are equally important to be given attention. It’s just that some subject areas may be easier to deal with depending on different factors. The subjects in senior high school (SHS) and junior high school (JHS) differ in a way that SHS subjects are more specific areas that are deemed essential for the track and strand you chose while in JHS, subjects are the general ones that we have since first grade, just increasing in complexity. Another similarity is that when you enter SHS and JHS, you have to prepare yourself to be a responsible part of the institution that you will enroll in. You should be ready to follow the policy that the school implements. Being a “senior” high student doesn’t mean you are superior or anything and being a “junior” high student doesn’t mean that you are under those in the SHS. The difference comes when there may be slight changes in the way rules and regulations are applied and the gravity of reprimands you may receive as you step up to higher grade levels or as you encounter different situations. In general, whether there are similarity or difference in being a Senior or Junior high school student, it’s is still up to you how you will handle it.​</a>

                                            1. Do you feel like you’ve lived this same day many times before?
Take a hard look to see if you are spending each day like the day before. Is your life filled with monotony? For most of us, monotony means a boring and uninspired life. But to some this is not necessarily a bad thing, especially if you answer “yes” to question number 2.
2. Are you living the life of your dreams?
If you had a choice today of how to live your life, what would you do? Is that what you are doing now?
3. What would you do if fear was not a factor and you could not fail?
Many hard questions to ask yourself are surround by fear. Fear is difficult because it holds us back from attempting so many of our dreams! what one thing would you do if there was no fear involved?</a>

DIRECTIONS: Read the story below then answer the questions that follow.THE FIRST RAINBOW	One day, Bathala planned a journey to Earth to visit his faithful followers. He called his children to bid them farewell. All of them came but Bighari, the Goddess of Flowers.	Bathala, who valued promptness, became angry because this was not the first time that Bighari missed their gathering. Thus, he banished her from heavenly kingdom.	At that time, Bighari was at her garden on Earth. She wept bitterly when she was told of her banishment, but she sought to cope with her sorrow by causing her garden to bloom profusely.	The legend of the rainbow says that the people that used to live around her garden grew to love her more and more for bringing beauty to their lives. They resolved, after a time, to build her a bower so that they could see her garden even from a long distance. 	And so, they built it. And decked it all over with colorful blooms. Thereafter, whenever Bighari would travel, people would see her colorful bower against the sky.1. Who visited the Earth? __________________________2.

                            19.  ,       Aren’t you tired of pretending that you are okay? Honey, it is okay to feel sad, that is part of our life. You always concealed your emotions through smiling. Does pretending can make you feel that you are okay?     And sweetie, aren’t u tired of saying that you are okay? If you wanna cry then let it flow. Cry as hard as you want but make sure that once you stop crying, you’ll also let your heart become well. It is okay not to be okay but wanna know what is not okay? Forcing yourself that you are, even if you are not. And this is an open letter for you.       You are a soldier because you are strong. You are beautiful because you are you. Do not compare yourself to others because you are unique and honey, it is okay to feel sad because you are still alive and that’s life.      Stop pretending that you aren’t hurt, be true to yourself and stop covering what you really feel.      I wrote this because I want you to feel that you are enough and if ever someone let you feel that you aren’t, I just want to say that I am proud of you and you are more than enough.       No matter how hard it is just kept on going in life. If you aren’t okay today, just keep on fighting until you reach the end. You’ll be okay, maybe not now but soon. I have a trust on you and I hope you will make yourself okay.    If crying doesn't make you feel okay. Accept everything that has been done, move forward and see the beauty in life.      To all ladies and men, if ever you read this one. I just want to remind you that if you are in pain or suffering right now. I am with you, God is with you, and you have yourself.       ’  , ..                                               yours truly,                                               the one who                                               experienced                                               pain but now                                               totally healed.​</h2><br />

                            21. Do you know who you are? When you look at yourself in the mirror, what do you see? The best version of yourself? A façade? A blank picture of yourself? Or you have got amnesia? Or where you can no longer feel your inner self? That's the worst feeling one could ever have and comparable to dark night. What you see in the mirror is exactly what you see, what you get, and what you are. Again, the question is who you are. This poses you to rediscover who you truly are and how to reveal, Predefine, and reactivate yourself again.To turn to your original condition, every time you broke your inner senses, every time you were struck by your fears, every time you lost courage and hope, and every time you failed. Blindfolded with all the shams and drudgeries in life, we are curtailed to bring out the best in us. The challenge is there all the time, put your blindfolded off, for this is just a test of life. Remembering and believing who we are,. is just the start of living life to the fullest again this is the first step. Next is to live the truth. You are created for a purpose and thus loved by God. With this, you will experience healing inside and your completeness through Him will then radiate love and joy to others too. No philosophers, even the best ones can give us the best ways to overcome our personal challenges. It is just our relationship with God. The best system is prayer. When you ray, you talk to God and your journey with Him will take place. It is our pause from time to time that we will be refreshed with something new, something better, a fresh start, a clean state, and a new journey to begin again. We can choose differently! Remember, what matters most is not how others see you, but how you truly see yourself. Who are you when you are all alone? When no one is watching? How do you see yourself determines how you allow people to treat you? How you see yourself dictates what you expect from others, from life, from God. Choose today to be the greatest version of yourself. Do not forget to wear the best make-up SMILE, and the world will smile at you.Eden Grace C.

                            23. Instruction: Congratulations for making it this far! You’re almost done. Before you proceed to your next lesson, let us test your mastery. Today’s task is to read the following paragraphs and determine which pattern of development in writing is used. Are you ready? Here are the paragraphs. 1. Caring for yourself during these times is also caring for others. When we are allowed to go outside our houses, we should obey health practices. Some are skeptic about wearing masks. Others are still in doubt when asked to wash hands often or use alcohol and sanitizer. There are also people who question the need to maintain distance from each other in public areas. These safety measures are set because they are proven to be helpful in preventing the spread of the virus. They are not mere wishes to make our lives difficult. We are asked to do these health protocols because we are still in danger with the rising number of COVID-19 cases. Be responsible for yourself so that you will not be the reason for others to catch the virus. If you care for your loved ones, you must take care of yourself first. You do not want to be the one bringing the virus to your home. 2. The word quarantine is such a familiar one to almost everyone who are aware of the pandemic today. According to the Merriam- Webster dictionary online, it is a noun that has several meanings. It states that it is a period of 40 days. It may also be a term during which a ship arriving in port and suspected of carrying contagious disease is held in isolation from the shore. Also, it means a restraint upon the activities or communication of persons or the transport of goods designed to prevent the spread of disease or pests. It is also defined as a state of enforced isolation. For us, who have been in community quarantine for more or less three months, we know that quarantine means staying at home and waiting for the situation to be better. It is a condition wherein only those who have quarantine pass are allowed to go out for essential needs of the family. For others, the concept quarantine may also be equated to “no work, no pay” policy. Some may define it as something needed for people who are sick or those who came from places with COVID-19 cases. On the other hand, some probably sees quarantine as something that takes away their right to see family, relatives and friends. To sum it up, whatever or however we understand quarantine, we need to follow it as a safety protocol since we are still fighting this pandemic. 3. There are several similarities and differences between being a senior and junior high school student. Being a senior and junior high school student, both require you to study hard to be able to get desirable outputs and decent grades. Subjects are equally important to be given attention. It’s just that some subject areas may be easier to deal with depending on different factors. The subjects in senior high school (SHS) and junior high school (JHS) differ in a way that SHS subjects are more specific areas that are deemed essential for the track and strand you chose while in JHS, subjects are the general ones that we have since first grade, just increasing in complexity. Another similarity is that when you enter SHS and JHS, you have to prepare yourself to be a responsible part of the institution that you will enroll in. You should be ready to follow the policy that the school implements. Being a “senior” high student doesn’t mean you are superior or anything and being a “junior” high student doesn’t mean that you are under those in the SHS. The difference comes when there may be slight changes in the way rules and regulations are applied and the gravity of reprimands you may receive as you step up to higher grade levels or as you encounter different situations. In general, whether there are similarity or difference in being a Senior or Junior high school student, it’s is still up to you how you will handle it.​</h2><br />

                            27. Do you know who you are? When you look at yourself in the mirror, what do you see? The best version of yourself? A façade? A blank picture of yourself? Or you have got amnesia? Or where you can no longer feel your inner self? That's the worst feeling one could ever have and comparable to dark night. What you see in the mirror is exactly what you see, what you get, and what you are. Again, the question is who you are. This poses you to rediscover who you truly are and how to reveal, Predefine, and reactivate yourself again.To turn to your original condition, every time you broke your inner senses, every time you were struck by your fears, every time you lost courage and hope, and every time you failed. Blindfolded with all the shams and drudgeries in life, we are curtailed to bring out the best in us. The challenge is there all the time, put your blindfolded off, for this is just a test of life. Remembering and believing who we are,. is just the start of living life to the fullest again this is the first step. Next is to live the truth. You are created for a purpose and thus loved by God. With this, you will experience healing inside and your completeness through Him will then radiate love and joy to others too. No philosophers, even the best ones can give us the best ways to overcome our personal challenges. It is just our relationship with God. The best system is prayer. When you ray, you talk to God and your journey with Him will take place. It is our pause from time to time that we will be refreshed with something new, something better, a fresh start, a clean state, and a new journey to begin again. We can choose differently! Remember, what matters most is not how others see you, but how you truly see yourself. Who are you when you are all alone? When no one is watching? How do you see yourself determines how you allow people to treat you? How you see yourself dictates what you expect from others, from life, from God. Choose today to be the greatest version of yourself. Do not forget to wear the best make-up SMILE, and the world will smile at you.Eden Grace C.
