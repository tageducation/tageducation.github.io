                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>you, you yourself is the acceptable thing in the world :))</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p> “Happiness depends upon ourselves.”</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>2. “To be kind to all, to like many and love a few, to be needed and wanted by those we love, is certainly the nearest we can come to happiness.”
</p><p>
</p><p>3. “Happiness is not something ready-made. It comes from your own actions.”  </p><p>4. “If you want happiness for an hour—take a nap. If you want happiness for a day—go fishing. If you want happiness for a year—inherit a fortune. If you want happiness for a lifetime—help someone else.”  </p><p>
</p><p>5. “It’s a helluva start, being able to recognize what makes you happy.
</p><p>
</p><p>6. “Don’t underestimate the value of Doing Nothing, of just going along, listening to all the things you can’t hear, and not bothering.”
</p><p>
</p><p>9. “It’s been my experience that you can nearly always enjoy things if you make up your mind firmly that you will.”
</p><p>
</p><p>10. “Since you get more joy out of giving joy to others, you should put a good deal of thought into the happiness that you are able to give.” </p><p>
</p><p>11. “Very little is needed to make a happy life; it is all within yourself, in your way of thinking.”  </p><p>
</p><p>12. “I’d far rather be happy than right any day.”  </p><p>
</p><p>13. “The foolish man seeks happiness in the distance, the wise grows it under his feet.”
</p><p>
</p><p>14. “Happiness is nothing more than good health and a bad memory.” —Albert Schweitzer
</p><p>
</p><p>15. “I, not events, have the power to make me happy or unhappy today. I can choose which it shall be. Yesterday is dead, tomorrow hasn’t arrived yet. I have just one day, today, and I’m going to be happy in it.”</p><br />

Laplace said that the material from which the solar system was formed was once a slowly rotating cloud, or nebula, of extremely hot gas. The gas cooled and the nebula began to shrink. As the nebula became smaller, it rotated more rapidly, becoming somewhat flattened at the poles.
</p><p>
</p><p>A combination of centrifugal force, produced by the nebula's rotation, and gravitational force, from the mass of the nebula, caused rings of gas to be left behind as the nebula shrank. These rings condensed into planets and their satellites, while the remaining part of the nebula formed the sun.</p><br />

                        My Viewpoint: PHILIPPINES WINNING ARBITRATION CASE AGAINST CHINA OVER SOUTH CHINA SEA<p></p><p>How to protect and uphold <strong>our sovereign rights</strong> in our Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) in the West Philippine Sea is one of the biggest concerns facing the nation today (WPS). What's at risk is a vast marine region that is abundant in fish, oil, gas, and other natural resources and is greater than the entire landmass of the Philippines.</p><p></p><p>Because China had not yet joined UNCLOS at the time, we were unable to file a claim with a tribunal established under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). That a powerful state could just take what lawfully belonged to a lesser state and that there was no authority on earth that could rectify such a mistake left a lasting impression on me as a result of this episode.</p><p></p><p>China had shown the rest of the world that power always wins. Unsettlingly, China was asserting ownership of 80% of our EEZ in the WPS as well as Mischief Reef. It was clear that China would take more geological features from the Philippines than only Mischief Reef.</p><p></p><p>We must discover strategies to close this gap between a final arbitral decision's implementation and <strong>justice</strong> as lifelong students of the law. The arbitral decision is binding on the parties, yet justice cannot exist if it is not upheld. The enforcement or execution of the judgment or award is "the fruit and end of the litigation and the life of the law," as every lawyer worth his attaché case is aware.</p><p></p><p>The best and brightest legal fighters in our nation today must step up and fight in this contemporary conflict to protect the Philippine EEZ from<strong> foreign incursion</strong>. We must rely on the most potent tool ever created by man to settle international conflicts in order to safeguard our EEZ. This tool can immobilize armies, destroy aircraft carriers, nullify the use of nuclear weapons, and level the playing field between superpowers and smaller countries.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Learn more about the law here: https://brainly.ph/question/52086#</strong></p><p></p><p>#SPJ2</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>For me, the most acceptable theory about changes in Earth's lithosphere would be The Theory of Plate Tectonic. </p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p>Why do I say so? The theory of plate tectonics is based on a broad synthesis of geologic and geophysical data. It is now almost universally accepted, and its adoption represents a true scientific revolution, analogous in its consequences to quantum mechanics in physics or the discovery of the genetic code in biology. </p><p></p><p>This theory is more acceptable and  important because they are often associated with earthquakes and volcanoes. When Earth’s tectonic plates grind past one another, enormous amounts of energy can be released in the form of earthquakes. Volcanoes are also often found near plate boundaries because molten rock from deep within Earth—called magma—can travel upward at these intersections between plates.</p><br />
