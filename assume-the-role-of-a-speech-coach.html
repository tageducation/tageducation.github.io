                        <p><strong>Giving a speech is also the ability to express what is in your mind.</strong> It is a way of showing how you feel, experienced or heard.  </p><p></p><p>Giving a speech may terrify some individuals but with the right approach and mindset, <strong>anyone can wow the audience by keeping these things in mind:</strong></p><p></p><strong>Preparation</strong><strong><br /></strong>There is nothing more important than preparation. <strong>Whether the speech is prepared or not, preparation will be a great factor to ace your speech.</strong> Even experts in speech making feel nervous every time they give out their rehearsed speech. This is why it is important to prepare your piece before delivering it to a huge audience.<br /><br /><strong>Organize your thoughts</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Organizing thoughts is a systematic way of arranging your ideas in one</strong>. It helps your audience understand and follow the flow of your speech. Speeches sound more professional if they are well-organized. It would also be easier to transition from one idea to another as long as they convey connected concepts.<br /><strong>Considering the audience</strong><strong><br /></strong>Whether you are giving a speech for your school or in a huge audience of entrepreneurs, <strong>it is really important to know to who you are giving your speech</strong>. Say for example you are delivering your speech to elementary students. We need to match the words, pacing, and speed of the speech to their age. If we are delivering a speech to teachers, we should be more professionals and choose the right words for them to understand more what we are saying.<br /><strong>Be Confident</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>No matter how good the content of your speech is, if you do not sound confident, you will lose your reputation as a good speaker.</strong> No matter how good the facts and evidence you are giving, the audience will have hesitations to believe in you because you will look unsure of the things you are sharing. There is no perfect speech but we can make it believable by being confident with the available resources we have.<br /><strong>Know the purpose</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>The main question would be 'Why am I delivering this speech?'.</strong> Think of the benefits your audience can get from your speech. It is also important to analyze why you are giving a speech. Know the purpose at the end of the end and focus on long-term knowledge they can get.<p></p><p>In addition to the five strategies mentioned above, a good communicative strategy would be a great help for a more effective approach.

We have to make the necessary adjustments and adaptations because if not, then we will all suffer in stagnation and fear.</p><p></p><p>Let us keep a spirit of strong belief that we will all go through this victoriously.

Let us not grow timid, not extending any help for others at all when we can and we should.</p><p></p><p>May we not dwell on the tremendous and tragic impact of this pandemic, but may we look at the blessings that we have on our hands.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Many people take for granted the opportunities they receive through the hard work of others, but this attitude needs to stop because it has become the “norm” for students to expect their teachers and professors to provide them with an education. While it is true that in the United States, students are required to attend school until the age of eighteen, many children around the world lack this luxury. This “right” is commonly looked down upon by students, because they do not have the motivation to succeed, as they did not have to work to get into school and to pay for their schooling. Everyone takes something for granted, whether it is an education, a roof over one’s head, food on the table, or the commencement speaker at one’s high school graduation, everyone forgets to be thankful. As Admiral McRaven stated, “But of all the things I remember, I don’t have a clue who the commencement speaker was that evening, and I certainly don’t</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Rather than continuing to take the opportunities presented to me for granted, I will strive to use these chances to make a difference in the lives’ of others. As Admiral McRaven said, “Generations were saved by one decision, by one person.” The presence of one person and their decisions can easily change the lives of dozens of people if that person allows themselves to invest in the lives’ of those around them. As a member of the Embry-Riddle Prescott Honors Program, I am held to and hold myself to a higher standard. By making the most of my time at Embry-Riddle, I can not only change my own future, but also influence the decisions others make. I will use my time at Embry-Riddle to change not only my own life, but those of my peers through listening to the advice of Admiral McRaven, and using my decisions to change the world around me, rather than taking for granted the opportunity to positively impact another</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p>800+ words</p><p></p><br />

                            28. the football team coach giving his last minute instructions to his players what type of speech style​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Formal Speech Style</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>What distinguishes the formal speech style from the consultative style is the lack of listener participation. Unlike in interactions that use the consultative style, the listener does not participate, in most cases, in an interaction that requires the formal style. A formal style is often used in formal situations, such as in a graduation ceremony, an official meeting, a television newscast, and a conference, where there is only one-way communication. Since there is little or no feedback from the listeners or audience, the speaker needs to plan ahead of his or her utterances, or what he or she is going to say. Other characteristics of the formal style are:
</p><p>  </p><p>a. Interruptions are not allowed. Only the speaker is the source of information.
</p><p>b. Pronunciation is very clear.
</p><p>c. Words are carefully chosen, and grammar rules are followed.
</p><p>d. Sentence structures are more complex and varied.
</p><p>e. Extensive and technical vocabulary is required.
</p><p>f. Ideas are cohesive and organized.
</p><p>g. All background or necessary information is clearly given.
</p><p>This speech style is also used in sermons, speeches, and announcements. This is also the style that is used for academic and business writing.
