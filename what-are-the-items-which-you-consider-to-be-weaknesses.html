What are the items which you consider to be weaknesses or areas for improvement? What words which are neutral or factual, such as "5 feet 4 inches tall, 120 pounds"? Do some categories have more minus than plus areas? The larger proportion of minus to plus areas you have, the more effort will be needed to achieve positive self-esteem.

                        <p>Knowing your weaknesses is as important as knowing your strengths.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>4 items that I hold to consider weaknesses for self-improvement:</strong></p><p>1. Embrace the weaknesses</p><p>2. Start journaling</p><p>3. Start doing something for myself</p><p>4. Tell the friends or closest people and ask their opinion about me</p><p></p><p><strong>EXPLANATION:</strong></p><p><strong>1. Embrace the weaknesses</strong></p><p>Understanding that everyone is different, and understanding how I am different, is the first step to knowing yourself. I try to accept and understand what I am lacking. I wrote a list of my strengths and weaknesses. I ask myself, do I want to change the traits that I lack? For my strengths, I always increase my potential again humbly.</p><p></p><p><strong>2. Start journaling</strong></p><p>Writing a diary or journal may seem too childish for us. But journaling helped me get to know myself better. I have a special book for my journal and only I can read. Then make it a routine every day to record what I'm grateful for, what I learned and what I want to change tomorrow. I freed myself to tell the exciting experience that day.</p><p></p><p><strong>3. Start doing something for myself</strong></p><p>I make time for myself and my hobbies. For example, take part in volunteer activities. If I can do one thing with satisfactory results, that can be my strength. If I find it difficult and cause problems, it could be my weakness. But that doesn't mean I give up! I can fix it with the advantages that I have or there is nothing wrong with asking a friend for help.</p><p></p><p><strong>4. Tell the friends or closest people and ask their opinion about me</strong></p><p>In my opinion, there is nothing wrong with telling friends about ourselves. With this I can know how I look in their eyes. In addition, I also have to be ready to accept their criticism and suggestions to build a better personality.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>Let's see more about self-weaknesses in relationship here:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/8740891</p><p></p><p>#SPJ2</p><br />
