                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>I believe that Face to Face learning is better than online learning because students have access to various learning resources on campus verses off. Face to face allows students to have instant gratification with answers and help. When a student is in class they can ask questions while it is fresh on their mind or help with a particular problem. If the student was at home online they would have to wait for the instructor to email them back. </p><p></p><p>Face to face students also gain from socialization with peers and interaction with teachers. According to Association for talent development, (2016),“One of the key elements of the learning process is the dynamic relationship shared between.</p><p></p><p>Face-to-face communication allows the entire experience to not only be heard but also seen and felt. Face-to-face training also adds a personal element to a workshop as opposed to computer-based education.”</p><p></p><p>©TTO</p><p></p><br />

We cannot deny the fact that many of our students are not studying well since they have their immediate family member/s who can answer their learning activities/module. Given the fact that we are just adapting the situation brought about by this trying time, but i want to give an emphasis on the above mentioned topic because what i see in the F2F classes if very different not because of the physical aspect but in the intellectual learning of our students. If i can be of this opportunity to write about and express my point of view, i know i can be a big help for the parents and students to realize the importance of going to school and undergo individual learning. After all, its limited and there is nothing wrong in bringing back the school learning modality as long as we follow protocols for the safety of our students.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        Face to Face Classes<p></p><p>Individuals are required to attend school under the traditional <strong>face-to-face classes</strong> system, which is still employed in many states.<strong> Face-to-face learning is superior to online learning because there is less distraction and more opportunity for students to interact with their professors and fellow classmates</strong>. Since it enables teachers to pinpoint students' areas of weakness and devise strategies to support the learners in overcoming obstacles, interpersonal interaction between students and their instructors is essential. Teachers can mentor students in dealing with a variety of challenges they might come across in their professional domains and educate them about other facets of society. For instance, teachers can build strong bonds with kids, act as their counselors, and teach them moral principles, therefore, interpersonal communication between students and teachers is a crucial issue that is challenging to implement in online learning. </p><p></p><p>Students are encouraged to connect with others and develop social skills through <strong>face-to-face instruction</strong>. People all throughout the world hold a variety of beliefs and values.<strong> Learning about other cultures makes it easier for people to communicate with many different people in groups and in the community</strong>. It also aids in valuing and appreciating the backgrounds of others. Conflicts in the community have also been sparked by the subject of religion. Face-to-face instruction is essential because it allows kids to interact with peers of different faiths and teach them the value of respecting all religions. Additionally, it should be noted that in-person instruction covers matters such as cultural differences and other problems that people encounter in their communities in addition to academic performance.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>To know more about face to face classes, visit the link below:</strong></p><p><strong>https://brainly.ph/question/9763060 </strong></p><p><strong>#SPJ2</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>I believe that Face to Face learning is better than online learning because students have access to various learning resources on campus versus off. Face to face allows students to have instant gratification with answers and help. When a student is in class they can ask questions while it is fresh on their mind or help with a particular problem. If the student was at home online they would have to wait for the instructor to email them back. Is that really more conducive to a person’s education and learning?</strong></p><p><strong>Face-to-face students also gain from socialization with peers and interaction with teachers. According to Association for talent development, (2016),” One of the key elements of the learning process is the dynamic relationship shared between</strong></p><p><strong>Face-to-face communication allows the entire experience to not only be heard but also seen and felt. Face-to-face training also adds a personal element to a workshop as opposed to computer-based education. “</strong></p><p><strong>“According to results of a new national research study, 78% of more than 1,000 students surveyed still believe it is easier to learn in a classroom”. USA Today, (2016) Students are able to physically see the work and are able to use tactile stimulation for their learning needs. Face-to-face students are able to find out the type of learner they are. In discovering their learning style students can use their knowledge to guide them in their educational experience and needs.</strong></p><p><strong>Those who disagree with me think that online learning allows a student to learn at their own pace. Students are able to take the time to understand and figure out problems with the resources that are provided. The convenience of learning in an environment that is conducive to that particular student learning is provided by the student. If the student feels comfortable they are more apt.</strong></p><p><strong>Explanation: Sana makatulong ito :)</strong></p><br />

Students can grow more within a group of people learning together. Interaction between students and teacher is clear and accurate, can interact with each other, and can ask direct questions from the teacher. Students can interact with each other without any hindrance or barricade. Questions are not difficult to answer since they can help each other within the class. It's never boring to be in school.

                        <p>Face to Face Classes</p><p>Individuals are required to attend school under the traditional face-to-face classes system, which is still employed in many states. Face-to-face learning is superior to online learning because there is less distraction and more opportunity for students to interact with their professors and fellow classmates. Since it enables teachers to pinpoint students' areas of weakness and devise strategies to support the learners in overcoming obstacles, interpersonal interaction between students and their instructors is essential. Teachers can mentor students in dealing with a variety of challenges they might come across in their professional domains and educate them about other facets of society. For instance, teachers can build strong bonds with kids, act as their counselors, and teach them moral principles, therefore, interpersonal communication between students and teachers is a crucial issue that is challenging to implement in online learning.</p><p></p><p>Students are encouraged to connect with others and develop social skills through face-to-face instruction. People all throughout the world hold a variety of beliefs and values. Learning about other cultures makes it easier for people to communicate with many different people in groups and in the community. It also aids in valuing and appreciating the backgrounds of others. Conflicts in the community have also been sparked by the subject of religion. Face-to-face instruction is essential because it allows kids to interact with peers of different faiths and teach them the value of respecting all religions. Additionally, it should be noted that in-person instruction covers matters such as cultural differences and other problems that people encounter in their communities in addition to academic performance.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <strong>Answer:</strong><p>Face-to-face learning allows students to get a better understanding by asking questions. Face-to-face courses allows the student to get an understanding right away and reduces possible stress. On the other hand, online courses lack in the area of physical communication. Communication is virtually done through emails or discussion board assignments; often times this can be a disadvantage to students who need a quick response from their instructor.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />
