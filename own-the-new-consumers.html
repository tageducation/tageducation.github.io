Temporarily set aside your own opinion about a particular issue.6. Developing your skill in evaluating differing viewpoints is an essential critical thinking skill7.

role in consumer protection. A consumer has rights
mandated by law. These are privileges that an
individual is guaranteed of health products and
services. The Republic Act No. 7394 also known
as Consumer Act of the Philippines is a law that
protects the interest of the consumer, promotes the
general welfare, and establishes standards of
conduct for business and industry. There are eight
basic rights of a consumer according to the Act
(Banzon, et al. 2005).

Their player is worn on the wrist and allows users to change songs and the volume simply by pressing the thumb and forefinger together; once to change songs and twice to change the volume. This new feature could possibly make your player obsolete. You have the opportunity to obtain one of your competitor’s players, take it apart and examine it to explore their technology. 
Should you do it and copy their design? Or, should you look at your own product and come up with your own design?</a>

mandated by law. These are privileges that an
individual is guaranteed of health products and
services. The Republic Act No. 7394 also known

protects the interest of the consumer, promotes the
general welfare, and establishes standards of
conduct for business and industry. There are eight
basic rights of a consumer according to the Act
(Banzon, et al. 2005).

                            27. As the designer of a very successful line of mp3 players, you believe that your products are on the cutting edge and that the features that you have designed into your product are state of the art. At a recent consumer electronics trade show, a new competitor has shown their mp3 player with some extraordinary features.
Their player is worn on the wrist and allows users to change songs and the volume simply by pressing the thumb and forefinger together; once to change songs and twice to change the volume. This new feature could possibly make your player obsolete. You have the opportunity to obtain one of your competitor’s players, take it apart and examine it to explore their technology. 
Should you do it and copy their design? Or, should you look at your own product and come up with your own design?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>I should look at my own product and come up with my own design because copying makes the costumers lesser especially if they are using your competitors product they will say that you copied the design of the competitor and it will be a rumor but making it yourself design even though not much are buying still you made your best and if you make your own features they will say that the features are really good and the best.Just always remember that if you need something just pray and let your heart and god help you make it.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Hope this helps :)</p>#CARRY ON LEARNING<br />
