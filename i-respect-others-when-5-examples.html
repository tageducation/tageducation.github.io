                                            I am a student of the National University in Manila. I was only in my first year.
As a student I have an observed appreciation of virtue (CORE
VALUES) Like Respect for the elderly when you say "Po and OOpo" respect for each other
classmate's decision Respect for school law. As a nationalian I was
trustworthy such as not cheating on exams Telling the truth and being diligent.
Because I see other N.U. students cleaning outside the University. As a
student, it's not easy either because you have to pass a lot of exams
memorize and study so that you can pass every science. I see the unity of each
National because in one class there are different courses such as Marketing, HRM and others
pa. You can see in them that they get along well with every project of our school. I remember
when I was new to this school I got lost and asked my neighbor
student where my classroom immediately he immediately accompanied me to my room and me
thanked him.Even if there is leftovers in a room it doesn’t disappear like that
I witnessed I saw a cellphone charged in the room I did not move it
so did my classmates because they knew they didn’t return it immediately by the owner and
thanked us and the one I dropped my i.d and wallet I was crying before but there was
knocked on our classroom and introduced that he had picked up my i.d and wallet to my delight
I know there are still such people in the world because most people today can be exploited. .
My experience shows that students here can be trusted with ours
school. The teachers here at N.U. are kind and we can’t leave the classroom without
we have deep knowledge or lessons I learn a lot as a good student.
I believe that youth is the hope of the people. I can make it through
study hard, and avoid vice or any evil deeds such as gambling.
I will also strive to be a good example to my fellow youth. I totally believe
that the simple and small ways I do it is a big help in the development of
country I belong to. Whatever hardship I can bear do not despair
every test as a student many people will actually pull you down but confident
only self is needed, diligence, Perseverance and never forget the faith in us
Dear Lord he will help us and
will guide. The year is fast approaching now let's just strive as a good and
diligent students we will not realize that we will be able to finish school and
one day we will succeed in the life we ​​face.

                        <p><strong>What is respect?</strong></p><p><strong>Respect</strong> is when you admire and appreciate others no matter what. It results from the skills, qualities, attributes, or achievements that they possess and hold. Respect is when you give importance to others, and while seeing their differences upon you, you appreciate them. Respect can happen in many aspects of life, and everyone has their way of morals and values representing this approach. Respect can come from different myriads, whether family, friends, loved ones, or even strangers. Sometimes respect occurs mainly in an unexpected person, wherein somehow most people forget to respect themselves and loved ones.  Respect is a significant value, morals, and attitude that we Filipinos most nurture characteristics. </p><p></p><p><strong>Here are five examples for these attributes: </strong></p>I respected others when they knew how to put boundaries and limitations with their action. I admire people who love to let people mind their own business instead of forming a false story that isn't right.I respected people who knew how to respect older adults like our Lola and Lolo. They value the Filipino culture like 'mano po'. This is a lovely gesture that I always wanted to see.I respected people when they knew how to control their judgment rather than being insensitive and inconsiderate. People who knew how to manage their thoughts and keep what was inside their heads when they knew it would not benefit others.I respect people who don't waste time and give importance to time management, which is a good characteristic. I do want to be with people who constantly complain and can't accept the mistakes they make.Lastly, I respect people when they can sacrifice their happiness and success for others. That is the most selfless thing that I will always give my high respect, and that is the respect that I will give to my parents. <p></p><p><strong>Refer to these links for related information:</strong></p><p><strong>Question</strong>: What is the meaning of respect​</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/5722488 </p><p><strong>Question</strong>:  Why should we respect others?</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/13096413</p>#BrainlyEveryday<br />

VALUES) Like Respect for the elderly when you say "Po and OOpo" respect for each other
classmate's decision Respect for school law. As a nationalian I was
trustworthy such as not cheating on exams Telling the truth and being diligent.
Because I see other N.U. students cleaning outside the University. As a
student, it's not easy either because you have to pass a lot of exams
memorize and study so that you can pass every science. I see the unity of each
National because in one class there are different courses such as Marketing, HRM and others
pa. You can see in them that they get along well with every project of our school. I remember
when I was new to this school I got lost and asked my neighbor
student where my classroom immediately he immediately accompanied me to my room and me
thanked him.Even if there is leftovers in a room it doesn’t disappear like that
I witnessed I saw a cellphone charged in the room I did not move it
so did my classmates because they knew they didn’t return it immediately by the owner and
thanked us and the one I dropped my i.d and wallet I was crying before but there was
knocked on our classroom and introduced that he had picked up my i.d and wallet to my delight
I know there are still such people in the world because most people today can be exploited. .
My experience shows that students here can be trusted with ours
school. The teachers here at N.U. are kind and we can’t leave the classroom without
we have deep knowledge or lessons I learn a lot as a good student.
I believe that youth is the hope of the people. I can make it through
study hard, and avoid vice or any evil deeds such as gambling.
I will also strive to be a good example to my fellow youth. I totally believe
that the simple and small ways I do it is a big help in the development of
country I belong to. Whatever hardship I can bear do not despair
every test as a student many people will actually pull you down but confident
only self is needed, diligence, Perseverance and never forget the faith in us

will guide. The year is fast approaching now let's just strive as a good and
diligent students we will not realize that we will be able to finish school and
