                                            Mr. Ericson was a manager at a small insurance company in Minnesota. One cold winter day, April McKenzie, one of his employees, approached him about some time off from work. "This job is very important to me, Mr. Ericson, but I've been called into jury duty. When my government asks for my help, I have to answer the call." Mr. Ericson rubbed his forehead. "We really need you here, April, but the government needs you more. Take the time. We'll be alright." Mr. Ericson had thought that they needed her there at the office, but they managed fine without her. When April returned a week later, Mr. Ericson noticed that most of her skin was bright shade of red except for around her eyes. Pale white circles ran from the top of her eyebrows to the bottom of her cheeks. These pale circles were surrounded by sunburned flesh. That's when Mr. Ericson knew. "April, step into my office. There are some things we need to discuss," Mr. Ericson said ominously. 3. Where was April? - 4. What does Mr. Ericson want to talk about with April? 5. Why does April have white circles around her eyes?Answerpahanap nalang po​</a>

                                            how messed up is this?!
 my mom turned off my phone number for 6 months unless I can get my grades up. (i have mostly d's and a couple of f's and one c...) and now my dad can't call me or use the tracker. no number means no tracker. and I have a hard time sleeping as it is. I wake up late a lot of the time but before I would have people call me in the mornings to wake me up. I have 2 alarms that go off. and yesterday I decided to use my third one. I still was late for school. I got to school about 15 minutes after the fifth period bell. rest of the school day was normal. looking for people, doing my work, try not to be alone, you know... after school was me trying to get the boy I like to notice me since he kept ignoring me. it was really hard to manage it. in the end, we sat at a table and we were talking for about two and a half hours. since my dad can't use the tracker anymore he left the house to look for me. when I saw him I had just gotten off the bus, but I didn't want to be picked up so I kept walking... when I got home I started to clean my room and a half was cleaning my desk he came home. he yelled at me for about 30 min about everything. I am blaming my mom for my dad having to come to find me. reason? she is the one that disabled my number. when we originally discussed my number it was just going to be restricted. but no. after he finished, I went to my room and cried for about 30 min. after I was ready I went to eat. when I was almost done he came and yelled at me AGAIN for the same things. the only thing that kept me calm was the fact that I was eating. (and reading...) so as you can tell, my life is hell for me. and I'm not even going to get into my love life... so please tell me what you think.</a>

                                            Is the sky falling? Your manager, Mr. Roberts, stopped by your desk on his way out of the office at 2 p.m. on Friday afternoon. He handed you three letters he had signed and asked you to prepare envelopes and place the letters in the mail today. "Don't call me unless the sky is falling," he said on his way out the door. "I promised to spend some uninterrupted time with my wife and son this weekend." You prepared the envelopes and are looking over the letters when you notice what you think is a huge error. An amount in one of the letters is Php1,000,500.00. You are pretty sure the amount should be Php10,500.00. Discussion: 1. What do you think Mr. Roberts means by "unless the sky is falling"? 2. Should you mail the letter even though you think the amount is wrong? 3. How should you handle this situation?​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>From the given dialogue, it can be inferred that the speakers have a familial relationship. The effect of the familial relationship on language form is manifested in the use of informal language, such as the use of terms like “Ma” and “Papa”, as well as the use of the Tagalog term “anak”. The duration of interaction is lengthy, as the dialogue is composed of multiple exchanges between the speakers. The relationship of speaker-audience is interactive in nature, as both parties actively exchange ideas. The role and responsibilities of the speaker is to express their opinion and ideas, as well as to provide feedback to the other speakers. The message communicated is that the speaker is interested in pursuing business management at college, and the delivery is done in a respectful and humorous manner. When the speakers shifted in speech context, the tone shifted from a serious one to a more lighthearted one. The shift in speech style was from a formal one to an informal one. The shift in speech act was from a directive one to a humorous one. The shift in communicative strategy was from a confrontational one to a collaborative one.</p><br />

                            8. Exercise C Instructions: Analyze the given dialogue. Identify the kind of relationship that the speakers and listeners have and explain the effect on language form, duration of interaction, the relationship of speaker-audience, role and responsibilities of the speaker, message, and delivery when the speakers shifted in speech context, speech style, speech act, and communicative strategy. You do not have to discuss all the effects. You may opt to discuss the effects on language form, message, and delivery for example. Use another sheet of paper for your answer and attach it to this activity sheet. A rubric is given to serve as your guide to achieving a very good score. You: Ma, I would like to pursue business management at my college. Papa: (enters the dining area and interrupts) Business management??? You: Of course! To earn a lot of money. For your new shoes (laughing)! Mama: (disagreeing) Get another course, NOT THAT. The tuition fee is TOO EXPENSIVE. You: No! That's what I want. Papa: Ok, but we do not enough have money for that course. You: (disrespectful tone) It's your responsibility, not mine. Mama: (raising voice) YOU SHOULD NOT TALK THAT WAY, WE ARE YOUR PARENTS! Have some respect, anak. You: Sorry po! I said that because I want to study. But, I can go to work so I can study. I will multiply myself to my work and school at that time. Mama and Papa: (laughing voice) What do you mean "multiply?" You made us laugh. You: Nothing. I said "Mahal ko po kayo."​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>In this dialogue, the speakers have a familial relationship. The effect of this relationship on language form can be seen in the use of familiar terms and pronouns, such as "Ma," "Papa," and "anak," which are used to address family members in Filipino. This also affects the duration of interaction, as familial relationships tend to involve longer and more frequent interactions compared to other types of relationships.</p><p></p><p>The relationship between the speaker and audience in this dialogue is that of parent and child, with the parents serving as the audience and the child speaking to them. This affects the role and responsibilities of the speaker, as the child is expected to show respect and obedience to their parents.</p><p></p><p>The message in this dialogue revolves around the child's desire to pursue a college degree in business management, and the parents' disagreement with this decision due to financial concerns. The delivery of this message is affected by the shift in speech context, as the conversation moves from a casual conversation to a more serious discussion about the child's education and future. This can also be seen in the shift in speech style, from a casual and joking tone to a more respectful and serious tone.</p><p></p><p>The shift in communicative strategy can also be seen in the child's use of the term "multiply" in response to their parents' questioning of their statement. This is likely an attempt by the child to defuse the tension and lighten the mood by making a joke.</p><p></p><p>Overall, the effects of the familial relationship on language form, duration of interaction, speaker-audience relationship, and delivery can be seen throughout the dialogue.</p><p></p><p>Pabrainliest :)</p><p></p><br />

                            14. Mr. Ericson was a manager at a small insurance company in Minnesota. One cold winter day, April McKenzie, one of his employees, approached him about some time off from work. "This job is very important to me, Mr. Ericson, but I've been called into jury duty. When my government asks for my help, I have to answer the call." Mr. Ericson rubbed his forehead. "We really need you here, April, but the government needs you more. Take the time. We'll be alright." Mr. Ericson had thought that they needed her there at the office, but they managed fine without her. When April returned a week later, Mr. Ericson noticed that most of her skin was bright shade of red except for around her eyes. Pale white circles ran from the top of her eyebrows to the bottom of her cheeks. These pale circles were surrounded by sunburned flesh. That's when Mr. Ericson knew. "April, step into my office. There are some things we need to discuss," Mr. Ericson said ominously. 3. Where was April? - 4. What does Mr. Ericson want to talk about with April? 5.

                            15. how messed up is this?!
 my mom turned off my phone number for 6 months unless I can get my grades up. (i have mostly d's and a couple of f's and one c...) and now my dad can't call me or use the tracker. no number means no tracker. and I have a hard time sleeping as it is. I wake up late a lot of the time but before I would have people call me in the mornings to wake me up. I have 2 alarms that go off. and yesterday I decided to use my third one. I still was late for school. I got to school about 15 minutes after the fifth period bell. rest of the school day was normal. looking for people, doing my work, try not to be alone, you know... after school was me trying to get the boy I like to notice me since he kept ignoring me. it was really hard to manage it. in the end, we sat at a table and we were talking for about two and a half hours. since my dad can't use the tracker anymore he left the house to look for me. when I saw him I had just gotten off the bus, but I didn't want to be picked up so I kept walking... when I got home I started to clean my room and a half was cleaning my desk he came home. he yelled at me for about 30 min about everything. I am blaming my mom for my dad having to come to find me. reason? she is the one that disabled my number. when we originally discussed my number it was just going to be restricted. but no. after he finished, I went to my room and cried for about 30 min. after I was ready I went to eat. when I was almost done he came and yelled at me AGAIN for the same things. the only thing that kept me calm was the fact that I was eating. (and reading...) so as you can tell, my life is hell for me. and I'm not even going to get into my love life... so please tell me what you think.</h2><br />

                            21. Is the sky falling? Your manager, Mr. Roberts, stopped by your desk on his way out of the office at 2 p.m. on Friday afternoon. He handed you three letters he had signed and asked you to prepare envelopes and place the letters in the mail today. "Don't call me unless the sky is falling," he said on his way out the door. "I promised to spend some uninterrupted time with my wife and son this weekend." You prepared the envelopes and are looking over the letters when you notice what you think is a huge error. An amount in one of the letters is Php1,000,500.00. You are pretty sure the amount should be Php10,500.00. Discussion: 1. What do you think Mr. Roberts means by "unless the sky is falling"? 2. Should you mail the letter even though you think the amount is wrong? 3. How should you handle this situation?​</h2><br />
