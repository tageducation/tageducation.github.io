This can be expressed as; speed = distance /time.Since speed, distance and time are all related, we can calculate distances and times by thesimple arrangement of the formula. To find the time, we need to divide distance by speed (timedistance/speed).

The fastest land animal is the cheetah, which has a recorded speed of between 109.4 km/h (68.0 mph) and 120.7 km/h (75.0 mph).[1] The peregrine falcon is the fastest bird, and the fastest member of the animal kingdom, with a diving speed of 389 km/h (242 mph).[2] Among the fastest animals in the sea is the black marlin, with uncertain and conflicting reports of recorded speeds.</p><p>3.  Other large cats have long canines which enable them to easily bring down large prey - and they have more muscle power to seize and hang on to them. However, while it does have these disadvantages, the cheetah has one great advantage over all other cats - that is its ability to run at an amazing speed</p><p></p><br />
