Could you trust famous personalities who endorse health information and products?</p><p>No. Never ever trust a celebrity about any advertisement. I know precisely how health-associated companies work (in supplements, medicines, and also food).</p><p></p><p>Because I made a name in the field of migraine, one of the pharmaceuticals was “shopping around” for celebrities whom they could hire to push their products. Luckily they discovered that I will never ever promote a pharmaceutical.</p><p></p><p>They seriously were looking for an “influencer” and while I received several “are you interested” sort of notes, I ignored them. They contacted me via twitter, where I just confirmed who they were, and then later they emailed me several times. I have never ever responded to any of their requests.</p><p></p><p>Then a few months later I saw the drug being advertised on TV and in magazines by one of the biggest tennis names—I am not going to give names, but if you know migraines, you know whom I am talking about.</p><p></p><p>And is the product worthy of such push? Absolutely not! I doubt the celebrity tennis person advertising it is ever taking it.</p><p></p><p>4.) So that you cannot take the wrong medicine and to known the information about that product</p><p></p><p>PA BRAINLIST PO IF PWEDE THANKSSS</p><br />
