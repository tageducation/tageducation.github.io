                                            Mathematics is one subject that pervades life at any age and in any circumstance. Thus, its value goes beyond the classroom and the school. Mathematics
as a school subject, therefore, must be learned comprehensively and with much depth.
The twin goals of mathematics in the basic education levels, K-10, are Critical Thinking and Problem Solving.
Critical thinking, according to Scriven and Paul (1987) is the intellectually disciplined process of actively and skilfully conceptualizing, applying, analyzing,
synthesizing, and/or evaluating information gathered from, or generated by, observation, experience, reflection, reasoning, or communication, as a guide to belief and action.
On the other hand, according to Polya (1945 &amp; 1962), mathematical problem solving is finding a way around a difficulty, around an obstacle, and finding a solution to a
problem that is unknown.
These two goals are to be achieved with an organized and rigorous curriculum content, a well-defined set of high-level skills and processes, desirable values and
attitudes, and appropriate tools, taking into account the different contexts of Filipino learners.
There are five content areas in the curriculum, as adopted from the framework prepared by MATHTED &amp; SEI (2010): Numbers and Number Sense, Measurement,
Geometry, Patterns and Algebra, and Probability and Statistic</a>

                            4. Mathematics is one subject that pervades life at any age and in any circumstance. Thus, its value goes beyond the classroom and the school. Mathematics
as a school subject, therefore, must be learned comprehensively and with much depth.
The twin goals of mathematics in the basic education levels, K-10, are Critical Thinking and Problem Solving.
Critical thinking, according to Scriven and Paul (1987) is the intellectually disciplined process of actively and skilfully conceptualizing, applying, analyzing,
synthesizing, and/or evaluating information gathered from, or generated by, observation, experience, reflection, reasoning, or communication, as a guide to belief and action.
On the other hand, according to Polya (1945 &amp; 1962), mathematical problem solving is finding a way around a difficulty, around an obstacle, and finding a solution to a
problem that is unknown.
These two goals are to be achieved with an organized and rigorous curriculum content, a well-defined set of high-level skills and processes, desirable values and
attitudes, and appropriate tools, taking into account the different contexts of Filipino learners.
There are five content areas in the curriculum, as adopted from the framework prepared by MATHTED &amp; SEI (2010): Numbers and Number Sense, Measurement,
Geometry, Patterns and Algebra, and Probability and Statistic</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>slayed slay slay slay slay slay slay slay</p><p></p><p>The situation described appears to be a case of poor accounting practices at Prospere General Merchandise. Here is my analysis and justification of each point:</p><p></p>The fact that the financial reports are based on SFAS promulgated by the ASC is a positive sign, as it indicates that the company is following generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).Reporting assets and owner's equity at fair value but business obligations at historical cost is not necessarily a problem, as this is a common practice in accounting. However, it may be worth examining the company's specific reasoning for this choice.The fact that the company has only one employee serving as accountant, internal auditor, collector, and treasurer is a red flag. It is highly unlikely that this individual has the necessary skills and expertise to perform all of these roles effectively, which could lead to errors, fraud, or other issues.The consistent delay of financial reports suggests that the company lacks a proper accounting system or process. This could indicate a lack of organization, resources, or commitment to financial transparency.Reporting estimated future earnings in the current financial reports is not acceptable under GAAP, as financial statements are meant to reflect past performance and current conditions, not future projections.Changing accounting methods and procedures regularly can create confusion and inconsistency in financial reporting, which can make it difficult for stakeholders to understand the company's performance and financial position.Recording transactions without proper supporting documents is a serious breach of accounting ethics and can lead to inaccurate financial reporting.While minutes of meetings, business contracts, and future plans may not be financial in nature, they can provide important context and insight into the company's operations and performance.Refusing to be audited by an external auditor is a red flag, as it suggests a lack of transparency and accountability. While having an internal auditor is important, an external audit provides an objective and independent review of the company's financial reporting.Depreciating a refillable pen over five years is not a material error, but it is an indication that the company may not have a clear understanding of accounting principles and the concept of materiality.<br />
