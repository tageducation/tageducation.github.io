The boy smiled and disappeared as quietly as he had come. Later, as they were approaching the place where the two paths crossed, the old woman appeared and silently pointed the way to the city. Nyasha thanked her and gave her a small pouch filled with sunflower seeds. The sun was high in the sky when the party came to the grove of towering trees. Their uppermost branches seemed to bow down to Nyasha as she passed beneath them. At last, someone announced that they were near their destination. Nyasha ran ahead and topped the rise before the others could catch up with her. She stood transfixed at her first sight of the city. "Oh, my father," she called. "a great spirit must stand guard here! Just look at what lies before us. I never in all my life dreamed there could be anything so beautiful. Arm in arm, Nyasha and her father descended the hill, crossed the river and approached the city gate. Just as they entered through the great doors, the air was rent by piercing cries, and Manyara ran wildly out of a chamber at the center of the enclosure. When she saw Nyasha, she fell upon her sobbing. "Do not go to the king, my sister. Oh please, Father do not let her go!" she cried hysterically. "There's a great monster there, a snake with five heads! He said that he knew all my faults and that I displeased him. He would have swallowed me alive if I had not run. Oh, my sister, please do not go inside that place." It frightened Nyasha to see her sister so upset. But, leaving her father to comfort Manyara, she bravely made her way to the chamber and opened the door. On the seat of the great chief's stool lay the little garden snake. Nyasha laughed with relief and joy. "My little friend!" she exclaimed. "It's such a pleasure to see you, but why are you here?" "I am the king," Nyoka replied. And there, before Nyasha's eyes, the garden snake changed shape. "I am the king. I am also the hungry boy with whom you shared4.a yam in the forest and the old woman to whom you made a gift of sunflower seeds. But you know me best as Nyoka. Because I have been all these, I know you to be the Most Worthy and Most Beautiful daughter in the Land. It would make me very happy if you would be my wife." And so it was that, a long time ago, Nyasha agreed to be married. The king's mother and sisters took Nyasha to their house and the wedding preparations began. The best weavers in the land laid out their finest cloth for her wedding garments. Villagers from all around were invited to the celebration, and a great feast was held. Nyasha prepared the bread for the wedding feast from millet that had been brought from her village. Mufaro proclaimed to all who would hear him that he was the happiest father in all the land, for he was blessed with two beautiful and worthy daughters - Nyasha, the queen; and Manyara, a servant in the queen's household.​</a>

                                            Once there were two brothers. Anpu was the elder, and Bata was the younger. When their parents died, Anpu was already married and had a house of his own, so he took his little brother with him and treated him like his son. When the little brother grew to be a young man, he became an excellent worker. He did the plowing. He harvested the corn, and there was no one his equal in the whole land. Behold, the spirit of the god was within him.Every morning, the younger brother followed his oxen and worked all day in the fields, and every evening, he returned to the house with vegetables, milk, and wood. He laid all these before his elder brother, and he took with him his bread, and he drove the cattle into the field.Because Anpu loved his younger brother very much, his wife became very jealous and she wanted to destroy Bata. One day, when Anpu and Bata were in the fields, they needed some corn, so Anpu sent Bata home to get some. The younger brother found the wife combing her hair and said to her, “Get up and give me some corn that I may run to the field for my elder brother is in a hurry. Do not delay.”At eventide, Anpu returned home earlier than his brother because Bata had much work to do in the fields. Anpu was met by his wife, who was crying bitterly. She showed him her arms and legs which he had painted black and blue and accused Bata of having beaten her up. She pretended to be in great pain. She did not give him water to wash his hands with. She did not light the fire for him. She pretended that she was very sick.Anpu became very angry. He sharpened his knife and waited for Bata in the stable. When the sun went down, Bata came home as usual, loaded with herbs, milk and wood. As he entered the door, he saw the feet of his brother and the sharp knife hanging by his side. The brother sprang from him and Bata fled praying to the god Ra. “My good Lord! Save me from death, thou who divines the evil from the good.” Ra heard his cry. He made a river flow between one brother and the other and filled it with crocodiles.Bata asked his elder brother, “Why do you seek to kill me? Am I not your brother and have you not always treated me as if you were my father? Has not your wife been as mother to me? Now since you want to kill me, I shall go to the Valley of the Acacia.”Anpu answered, “Why did you beat up my wife and almost kill her.”Bata answered, “I did not do such thing. Have I told you that I have always looked upon her as my mother?”So, Anpu went home. He found his wife near the river washing off the black and blue dye with which she had painted herself. Filled with great anger, Anpu killed his wife and cast her to the dogs. Then, he sat down, poured ashes on his head and mourned for his younger brother. Bata reached the Valley of Acacia. Since there was no one with him, he slew wild beasts for food, built himself a house and met the Nine Gods who knew of his innocence and goodness. Ra said to the god Khunumu, “Behold, frame a woman for Bata that he may not remain alone.” So Khunumu made for Bata a wife to dwell with him. She was indeed more beautiful than any other woman in the whole land. She was like a goddess, and Bata loved her very much.
1.why did the wife get jealous of bata? 2.What did the wife do to get the attention of anpu? Do you agree with what she had done? why so? 3. if you were bata ,what would you do? Do you agree with him in leaving the house? Why so? 4. If you were anpu,would you believe your wife's explanation​</a>

The boy smiled and disappeared as quietly as he had come. Later, as they were approaching the place where the two paths crossed, the old woman appeared and silently pointed the way to the city. Nyasha thanked her and gave her a small pouch filled with sunflower seeds. The sun was high in the sky when the party came to the grove of towering trees. Their uppermost branches seemed to bow down to Nyasha as she passed beneath them. At last, someone announced that they were near their destination. Nyasha ran ahead and topped the rise before the others could catch up with her. She stood transfixed at her first sight of the city. "Oh, my father," she called. "a great spirit must stand guard here! Just look at what lies before us. I never in all my life dreamed there could be anything so beautiful. Arm in arm, Nyasha and her father descended the hill, crossed the river and approached the city gate. Just as they entered through the great doors, the air was rent by piercing cries, and Manyara ran wildly out of a chamber at the center of the enclosure. When she saw Nyasha, she fell upon her sobbing. "Do not go to the king, my sister. Oh please, Father do not let her go!" she cried hysterically. "There's a great monster there, a snake with five heads! He said that he knew all my faults and that I displeased him. He would have swallowed me alive if I had not run. Oh, my sister, please do not go inside that place." It frightened Nyasha to see her sister so upset. But, leaving her father to comfort Manyara, she bravely made her way to the chamber and opened the door. On the seat of the great chief's stool lay the little garden snake. Nyasha laughed with relief and joy. "My little friend!" she exclaimed. "It's such a pleasure to see you, but why are you here?" "I am the king," Nyoka replied. And there, before Nyasha's eyes, the garden snake changed shape. "I am the king. I am also the hungry boy with whom you shared4.a yam in the forest and the old woman to whom you made a gift of sunflower seeds. But you know me best as Nyoka. Because I have been all these, I know you to be the Most Worthy and Most Beautiful daughter in the Land. It would make me very happy if you would be my wife." And so it was that, a long time ago, Nyasha agreed to be married. The king's mother and sisters took Nyasha to their house and the wedding preparations began. The best weavers in the land laid out their finest cloth for her wedding garments. Villagers from all around were invited to the celebration, and a great feast was held. Nyasha prepared the bread for the wedding feast from millet that had been brought from her village. Mufaro proclaimed to all who would hear him that he was the happiest father in all the land, for he was blessed with two beautiful and worthy daughters - Nyasha, the queen; and Manyara, a servant in the queen's household.​</h2><br />

                            7. Once there were two brothers. Anpu was the elder, and Bata was the younger. When their parents died, Anpu was already married and had a house of his own, so he took his little brother with him and treated him like his son. When the little brother grew to be a young man, he became an excellent worker. He did the plowing. He harvested the corn, and there was no one his equal in the whole land. Behold, the spirit of the god was within him.Every morning, the younger brother followed his oxen and worked all day in the fields, and every evening, he returned to the house with vegetables, milk, and wood. He laid all these before his elder brother, and he took with him his bread, and he drove the cattle into the field.Because Anpu loved his younger brother very much, his wife became very jealous and she wanted to destroy Bata. One day, when Anpu and Bata were in the fields, they needed some corn, so Anpu sent Bata home to get some. The younger brother found the wife combing her hair and said to her, “Get up and give me some corn that I may run to the field for my elder brother is in a hurry. Do not delay.”At eventide, Anpu returned home earlier than his brother because Bata had much work to do in the fields. Anpu was met by his wife, who was crying bitterly. She showed him her arms and legs which he had painted black and blue and accused Bata of having beaten her up. She pretended to be in great pain. She did not give him water to wash his hands with. She did not light the fire for him. She pretended that she was very sick.Anpu became very angry. He sharpened his knife and waited for Bata in the stable. When the sun went down, Bata came home as usual, loaded with herbs, milk and wood. As he entered the door, he saw the feet of his brother and the sharp knife hanging by his side. The brother sprang from him and Bata fled praying to the god Ra. “My good Lord! Save me from death, thou who divines the evil from the good.” Ra heard his cry. He made a river flow between one brother and the other and filled it with crocodiles.Bata asked his elder brother, “Why do you seek to kill me? Am I not your brother and have you not always treated me as if you were my father? Has not your wife been as mother to me? Now since you want to kill me, I shall go to the Valley of the Acacia.”Anpu answered, “Why did you beat up my wife and almost kill her.”Bata answered, “I did not do such thing. Have I told you that I have always looked upon her as my mother?”So, Anpu went home. He found his wife near the river washing off the black and blue dye with which she had painted herself. Filled with great anger, Anpu killed his wife and cast her to the dogs. Then, he sat down, poured ashes on his head and mourned for his younger brother. Bata reached the Valley of Acacia. Since there was no one with him, he slew wild beasts for food, built himself a house and met the Nine Gods who knew of his innocence and goodness. Ra said to the god Khunumu, “Behold, frame a woman for Bata that he may not remain alone.” So Khunumu made for Bata a wife to dwell with him. She was indeed more beautiful than any other woman in the whole land. She was like a goddess, and Bata loved her very much.
1.why did the wife get jealous of bata? 2.What did the wife do to get the attention of anpu? Do you agree with what she had done? why so? 3. if you were bata ,what would you do? Do you agree with him in leaving the house? Why so? 4. If you were anpu,would you believe your wife's explanation​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. She get jealous because Anpu loves Bata so much. </p><p></p><p>2. She pretended that she was in great pain because Bata beat her up even if Bata is innocent. I don't agree with her actions because envy is a sin and it's not nice accuse someone of something they didn't do. </p><p></p><p>3. I would also leave the house like Bata did as I don't want to live in a house full of people who don't like me, didn't trust me and even wanted to end my life.</p><p></p><p>4. I wouldn't believe her  because Bata is my brother and I know he's not that kind of person. </p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.</p>The woman in the video was labeled as pitiful and was called flirt or flirting. She behaves seductively in the video. The manner in which she dresses herself and exposes her skin may offer inspiration to guys. We can see how the woman seduces the way she behaves aggressively in the video. Therefore she called as a flirt.Because of different social etiquette modes, flirting behavior varies across cultures, such as how close people should be, how long eye contact should be held, how much touch is appropriate, and so on. And pitiful, for she is clearly not well off. Yet she is very attractive to other people on the other hand.<p>2.</p>Yes, because no matter what happens to you it should never stop you from being successful<p>3.</p>When we label someone, we tend to see everything they do in terms of a fixed set of expectations. We fall into confirmation bias. We <strong>conjure up stories in our heads that confirm some prejudice or other.</strong> We confirm our first impressions and ignore conflicting information.<p>4.</p>there are different comments you may here in that situation it maybe good comments or bad comments.Actresses always make their self always neat in front of others to avoid judgement<p>5.</p>Just as single motherhood has no single cause and no certain outcome, there is no simple solution or "quick fix" for the problems facing single mothers and their children. Strategies for helping these families, therefore, must include those aimed at preventing family breakup and sustaining family resources as well as those aimed at compensating children for the loss of parental time and income<br />
