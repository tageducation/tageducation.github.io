High levels of estrogen stimulate further production of FSH 7. Estrogen stimulates the release of luteinizing hormone from the pituitary gland. 8. One feedback mechanism in menstrual cycle is that high levels of progesterone inhibit the further release of luteinizing hormone. 9. The luteinizing hormone initiates the maturation of the follicles. 10. During the menstrual cycle, the androgen causesthe uterine lining to increase in thickness. 11. Hormones have no influence in reproductive functions. 12.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Female reproductive traits can evolve due to selection of two basic types. Many selective pressures have nothing to do with competition among males, but rather with the female's ability to survive and produce a maximum number of healthy offspring. For instance, the low pH in the vagina of many mammals apparently reduces the danger of microbial infections of the female's reproductive tract. Such female traits resulting from natural selection can also incidentally result in selection on males (e.g. favour the ability of sperm to survive at a low pH, or ability to produce seminal products that can raise the pH). Female reproductive traits may also sometimes evolve because of their screening effects on males. For example, the advantage of having offspring sired by males whose semen has particularly good abilities to resist a low pH might favour a further reduction in vaginal pH as a mate-screening device.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>:))</p><br />

High levels of estrogen stimulate further production of FSH 7. Estrogen stimulates the release of luteinizing hormone from the pituitary gland. 8. One feedback mechanism in menstrual cycle is that high levels of progesterone inhibit the further release of luteinizing hormone. 9. The luteinizing hormone initiates the maturation of the follicles. 10. During the menstrual cycle, the androgen causesthe uterine lining to increase in thickness. 11.

Read and analyze each statement whether it is a fact or a bluff. If it is a fact, write the word AHA.If it is just a bluff, write OH NO. 1. Testosterone is a major sex hormone secreted by the interstitial cells of testes. 2. A male begins to make a testosterone before birth. 3. After puberty, testosterone maintains the adult male genital structure, reproductive ducts, and secondary sex characteristics. 4. Testosterone influences the female reproductive organ development necessary for reproductive cell formation 5. Follicle Stimulating Hormone stimulates the ovaries to release estrogen. 6. High levels of estrogen stimulate further production of FSH -7. Estrogen stimulates the release of luteinizing hormone from the pituitary gland. 8. One feedback mechanism in menstrual cycle is that high levels of progesterone inhibit the further release of luteinizing hormone. 9. The luteinizing hormone initiates the maturation of the follicles. 10. During the menstrual cycle, the androgen causesthe uterine lining to increase in thickness, 11. Hormones have no influence in reproductive functions. 12. Hormones secreted by the ovaries and the pituitary gland in the brain control the menstrual cycle. 13.Hormones play an important role in both male and female reproductive systems. 14. Androgen and testosterone are hormones of female. 15. Estrogen and progesterone influence female traits and support reproductive function.​</h2><br />
