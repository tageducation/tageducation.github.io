                            16. B. Determine further the meaning of methods of preserving meat. Arrange the jumbled letters of some terms. There are different methods of SERINGREVP (11) meat. These include drying which is the most common method of preserving meat. RALUTAN (12) sun drying is used to reduce the amount of moisture content of meat while DRAIONTHEYD (13) is using oven for drying the meat. NNNAIGC (14) is the process where meat is packed in sealed cans or jars. The method of preserving meat at temperature of 10°C and below is called EEZINGRF(15).​</h2><br />

Methods are based on control by low or high temperature, reducing available water, or by the application of chemical additives.</p><p></p><p><strong>Refrigerating</strong></p><p></p><p>Refrigerating is the most common method of meat preservation. The typical refrigerated storage life for fresh meats is 5 to 7 days. </p><p></p><p><strong>Canning</strong></p><p></p><p>The second most common method of meat preservation is canning. Canning involves sealing of meat in a container and then heating it to destroy all microorganisms capable of food spoilage. </p><p></p><p><strong>Drying</strong></p><p></p><p>Drying is another common method of meat preservation. Drying removes moisture from meat products so that microorganisms cannot grow. </p><p></p><p><strong>Fermentation</strong></p><p></p><p>One ancient form of food preservation used in the meat industry is fermentation. Fermentation involves the addition of certain harmless bacteria to meat. These fermenting bacteria produce acid as they grow. Then, the acid lower the pH of the meat and inhibiting the growth of many pathogenic microorganisms.</p><p></p><p><strong>Irradiation</strong></p><p></p><p>Irradiation is a pasteurization method accomplished by exposing meat to doses of radiation. Irradiation of meat is accomplished by exposing meat to high-energy ionizing radiation.</p><p></p><p><strong>Curing and Smoking</strong></p><p></p><p>Meat curing and smoking are two of the oldest methods of meat preservation. They not only improve the safety and shelf life of meat products but they also enhance the color and flavor of the meat.</p><p></p><p><strong>Smoking</strong> of meat decreases the available moisture on the surface of meat products, preventing microbial growth and spoilage.</p><p></p><p><strong>Meat curing</strong>, as commonly performed in products such as ham or sausage, involves the addition of mixtures containing salt, nitrite, and other preservatives.</p><p></p><p></p><p>For the importance of preservation, visit the link.</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/2143918</p><p></p><p>To know the Asian method of preservation:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/106711</p><p></p><p>Examples of food that can preserve, aside from meat:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/2139861</p><p></p><p></p><p>#LetsStudy</p><br />
