                                            so we're the first batch of k to 12 students who's now currently in grade 11. and I would like to share my opinion of it, so if you're 1 of the g11 students feel free to share your experiences.now first I noticed in g11 was youre pretty much chilling in the first few weeks. But after that it's like a domino brick has fallen and every week seems to pressure you even more. it feels like the 4th quarter in school and I find this very annoying, I can't spend time with my family. I choosed stem track but I feel like it doesn't prepare me for collage. the teaching method they use here is student centered learning tbh I feel like I'm not learning at all. but then it has to be you to find your answers. and scl from what I've seen its like a tsunami it keeps on moving and you should move early too. I wish the subjects would have more relevance of my course because let's be honest I don't want to learn anything about irrelevant topics, I wish you could pick your subjects to learn. but anyways I think senior high needs to be fixed I don't like the pressure all the time and it's kinda sad not have time to spend with my family. so let me know your thoughts about it. </a>

                                            so we're the first batch of k to 12 students who's now currently in grade 11. and I would like to share my opinion of it, so if you're 1 of the g11 students feel free to share your experiences.now first I noticed in g11 was youre pretty much chilling in the first few weeks. But after that it's like a domino brick has fallen and every week seems to pressure you even more. it feels like the 4th quarter in school and I find this very annoying, I can't spend time with my family. I choosed stem track but I feel like it doesn't prepare me for collage. the teaching method they use here is student centered learning tbh I feel like I'm not learning at all. but then it has to be you to find your answers. and scl from what I've seen its like a tsunami it keeps on moving and you should move early too. I wish the subjects would have more relevance of my course because let's be honest I don't want to learn anything about irrelevant topics, I wish you could pick your subjects to learn. but anyways I think senior high needs to be fixed I don't like the pressure all the time and it's kinda sad not have time to spend with my family. so let me know your thoughts about it.</a>

Jennifer walked in to the chef's and overheard him. Chef, could you share a little glory with the front of house please?" Jennifer asked. There is no secret here Jennifer. All I want is to get another diamond for the restaurant," Chef replied. I know chef, We discussed it a couple times," Jennifer said and walked away. The next day, Jennifer went to see Matthew to talk to him about what is going on between the two departments. She quoted the Chef saying," The main stumbling block to restaurant nirvana is the front of the house. Jennifer explained to Matthew how much she admires and respects the chef but, at the same time, she has the feeling, that the service is blamed for all errors, as if a 45-minute wait for entrees was the server's fault. Matthew promised her that he would deal with the situation.​</a>

                                            Instruction: Read the situation carefully. Apply the Seven Step Reasoning Modelto determine the best ethical choice to make. Write your answer in the spaceprovided below."Please Don't Tell!"A twenty-year-old Hispanic male was brought to a hospital emergencyroom, having suffered abdominal injuries due to gunshot wounds obtained ingang violence. He had no medical insurance, and his stay in the hospital wassomewhat shorter than expected due to his good recovery. Physiciansattending to him felt that he could complete his recovery at home just as easilyas in the hospital and he was released after only a few days in the hospital.During his stay in the hospital, the patient admitted to his primaryphysician that he was HIV positive, having contracted the virus that causesAIDS. This was confirmed by a blood test administered while he was hospitalized.When he was discharged from the hospital, the physician recommended thata professional nurse visit him regularly at home in order to change the bandageson his still substantial wounds and to ensure that an infection did not develop.Since he had no health insurance, he was dependent on Medicaid, agovernment program that pays for necessary medical care for those whocannot afford it. However, Medicaid refused to pay for home nursing care sincethere was someone already in the home who was capable of providing thenecessary care. That person was the patient's twenty-two-year-old sister, whowas willing to take care of her brother until he was fully recovered. Their motherhad died years ago, and the sister was accustomed to providing care for heryounger siblings.The patient had no objection to his sister providing this care, but heinsisted that she not be told that he had tested HIV positive. Though he hadalways had a good relationship with his sister, she did not know that he was anactive homosexual. His even greater fear was that his father would hear of hishomosexual orientation and lifestyle. Homosexuality is generally looked uponwith extreme disfavor among Hispanics.The patient's physician is bound by his code of ethics that places a very high priority on keeping confidentiality. That is, information about someone'smedical condition that he or she does not want known cannot be divulged bythe physician. Some would argue that the responsibility of confidentiality is evengreater with HIV/AIDS since disclosure of someone's homosexuality normallycarries devastating personal consequences for the individual who is forced "outof the closet."On the other hand, the patient's sister is putting herself at risk by providingnursing care for him. Doesn't she have a right to know the risks to which she issubjecting herself, especially since she willingly volunteered to take care of herbrother?If you were the physician, what would you do in this case? Would youbreach the norm of confidentiality to protect the patient's sister, or would youkeep confidentiality in order to protect the patient from harm that would cometo him from his other family members, especially his father?Perhaps as good a question as "what would you do" in this situation is thequestion, "how would you decide what to do" in this situation? The process ofmaking a moral decision can be as important as the decision itself, and manyethical decisions that people encounter are so complex that it is easy to exhaustoneself talking around the problem without actually making any progresstoward resolving it. The response to many moral dilemmas is "where do I start?'and the person who is faced with these decisions often needs direction that willenable him or her to move constructively toward resolution and "see the forestfor the trees."In order to adequately address the ethical dilemmas that peopleencounter regularly, the following is a model that can be used to ensure that allthe necessary bases are covered. This is not a formula that will automaticallygenerate the "right" answer to an ethical problem. Rather it is a guideline that isdesigned to make sure that all the right questions are being asked in the processof ethical deliberation.​</a>

                                            Writer Allison Levy worked alone. While she liked the freedom and flexibility of working from home, she sometimes missed having a community of coworkers, both for the practical purpose of brainstorming and the more social “water cooler” aspect. Levy did what many do in the Internet age: she found a group of other writers online through a web forum. Over time, a group of approximately twenty writers, who all wrote for a similar audience, broke off from the larger forum and started a private invitation-only forum. While writers in general represent all genders, ages, and interests, it ended up being a collection of twenty- and thirty-something women who comprised the new forum; they all wrote fiction for children and young adults.
At first, the writers’ forum was clearly a secondary group united by the members’ professions and work situations. As Levy explained, “On the Internet, you can be present or absent as often as you want. No one is expecting you to show up.” It was a useful place to research information about different publishers and about who had recently sold what and to track industry trends. But as time passed, Levy found it served a different purpose. Since the group shared other characteristics beyond their writing (such as age and gender), the online conversation naturally turned to matters such as child-rearing, aging parents, health, and exercise. Levy found it was a sympathetic place to talk about any number of subjects, not just writing. Further, when people didn’t post for several days, others expressed concern, asking whether anyone had heard from the missing writers. It reached a point where most members would tell the group if they were traveling or needed to be
The group continued to share. One member on the site who was going through a difficult family illness wrote, “I don’t know where I’d be without you women. It is so great to have a place to vent that I know isn’t hurting anyone.”

                            5. so we're the first batch of k to 12 students who's now currently in grade 11. and I would like to share my opinion of it, so if you're 1 of the g11 students feel free to share your experiences.now first I noticed in g11 was youre pretty much chilling in the first few weeks. But after that it's like a domino brick has fallen and every week seems to pressure you even more. it feels like the 4th quarter in school and I find this very annoying, I can't spend time with my family. I choosed stem track but I feel like it doesn't prepare me for collage. the teaching method they use here is student centered learning tbh I feel like I'm not learning at all. but then it has to be you to find your answers. and scl from what I've seen its like a tsunami it keeps on moving and you should move early too. I wish the subjects would have more relevance of my course because let's be honest I don't want to learn anything about irrelevant topics, I wish you could pick your subjects to learn. but anyways I think senior high needs to be fixed I don't like the pressure all the time and it's kinda sad not have time to spend with my family. so let me know your thoughts about it. </h2><br />
                        this is my opinion.. <br />21st teachers uses student-centered approach to prepare the student to be globally competent. 21st century teacher are facilitators, used authentic assessment, and engage us in a real-world task in order to enhance and develop our learning. Teachers nowadays, not teaching what you are going to learn but teaching us on how to learn. Cooperation is what the teacher ask from us.Hardship is part of your training and a step closer to the success. You have to sacrifice a little bit to be successful someday. Teachers also following the curriculum guide in their teaching. Teachers also find it hard because like you they cant spend time to their family to attend seminars that they can use in teaching us.

But after that it's like a domino brick has fallen and every week seems to pressure you even more. it feels like the 4th quarter in school and I find this very annoying, I can't spend time with my family. I choosed stem track but I feel like it doesn't prepare me for collage. the teaching method they use here is student centered learning tbh I feel like I'm not learning at all. but then it has to be you to find your answers. and scl from what I've seen its like a tsunami it keeps on moving and you should move early too. I wish the subjects would have more relevance of my course because let's be honest I don't want to learn anything about irrelevant topics, I wish you could pick your subjects to learn. but anyways I think senior high needs to be fixed I don't like the pressure all the time and it's kinda sad not have time to spend with my family. so let me know your thoughts about it.</h2><br />

Jennifer walked in to the chef's and overheard him. Chef, could you share a little glory with the front of house please?" Jennifer asked. There is no secret here Jennifer. All I want is to get another diamond for the restaurant," Chef replied. I know chef, We discussed it a couple times," Jennifer said and walked away. The next day, Jennifer went to see Matthew to talk to him about what is going on between the two departments. She quoted the Chef saying," The main stumbling block to restaurant nirvana is the front of the house. Jennifer explained to Matthew how much she admires and respects the chef but, at the same time, she has the feeling, that the service is blamed for all errors, as if a 45-minute wait for entrees was the server's fault. Matthew promised her that he would deal with the situation.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>THE WEAK LINK CASE TYPE - </strong>The group member who can be relied on the least</p><p></p><p>   The <strong>chef</strong> had a busy day at work, and by the time he left, it was almost time for supper. He was quite famished, obviously. He headed to the nearest restaurant where he was absolutely certain of being served with best of the cuisines. He made himself comfortable at a table and took a good look at the menu. Since he had been there earlier it didn’t take much time for Alex to place the order. The restaurant was quite well known for its chef who was famous for his world class dishes. He was fully supported with an excellent team who were capable of satisfying palates across the world. While Alex waited patiently, the chef got down to create his magic. Needless to say he did an excellent job in coming up with a masterpiece! The dish was ready to be served. As Alex almost reached the threshold of his patience, the kitchen doors opened. Through them came out a man in rags, holding a worn out platter on his left hand on which the signature dish was placed. He carried a soiled piece of cloth on his right hand and headed directly to Alex in the most untidy manner. He then placed the dish right in front of Alex along with a set of cutlery that someone used before!</p><p></p><p>  I believe it is pointless to say what happened to Alex’s hunger! While the above snippet is a work of fiction, this is absolutely true when it comes to Business Cases to plan the right technology solutions. An operational business unit would have come up with a fantastic proposal for a new change. They might have all valid reasons for coming up with the change and how it was going to help them run their business better. Their hunger for this change was akin to Alex. They placed this need promptly in front of a project team who reaches out to their IT counterpart for a solution. It is the turn of the <strong>‘chefs’</strong> at IT do their bit of magic. Whether it is an in-house application or a vendor product, together, the team comes up with a fantastic solution for the business problem. Quite a few rounds of discussions result in a presentable estimate. The ‘dish’ aka solution is ready to be served. Enter the team of people who consider themselves to be the specialists in Business Case. Their sole purpose of existence is to get the end users come up with a justification of why the change is required. Subsequently present this with all facts and figures so that approvals can be secured for timely implementation.</p><p>    This is when the ‘man in rags’ comes to light. If the <strong>Business Case</strong> is not backed up with sufficient facts and numbers, then it’ll never stack up. An absolutely important business change backed with a state-of-the-art solution will all go down the drains if a meticulously drafted Business Case is not placed on the table of decision makers. This <strong>weakest link</strong> many a times is a life changer for many. Initiatives could get approved or rejected based on the strength of Business Case. Careers could get redesigned. Professional paths could get forced to take a diversion. It all boils down to how much someone is willing to put their heart and soul into the act of getting a Business Case which is a sales pitch converted into a confirmed order. Till the time teams do not realize this, we’ll continue to have Business Cases that are akin to still born babies!</p><p></p><p>Learn more about <strong>Weakest Link type</strong>: https://brainly.ph/question/15573663</p><p><strong>#SPJ1</strong></p><br />

                            14. Instruction: Read the situation carefully. Apply the Seven Step Reasoning Modelto determine the best ethical choice to make. Write your answer in the spaceprovided below."Please Don't Tell!"A twenty-year-old Hispanic male was brought to a hospital emergencyroom, having suffered abdominal injuries due to gunshot wounds obtained ingang violence. He had no medical insurance, and his stay in the hospital wassomewhat shorter than expected due to his good recovery. Physiciansattending to him felt that he could complete his recovery at home just as easilyas in the hospital and he was released after only a few days in the hospital.During his stay in the hospital, the patient admitted to his primaryphysician that he was HIV positive, having contracted the virus that causesAIDS. This was confirmed by a blood test administered while he was hospitalized.When he was discharged from the hospital, the physician recommended thata professional nurse visit him regularly at home in order to change the bandageson his still substantial wounds and to ensure that an infection did not develop.Since he had no health insurance, he was dependent on Medicaid, agovernment program that pays for necessary medical care for those whocannot afford it. However, Medicaid refused to pay for home nursing care sincethere was someone already in the home who was capable of providing thenecessary care. That person was the patient's twenty-two-year-old sister, whowas willing to take care of her brother until he was fully recovered. Their motherhad died years ago, and the sister was accustomed to providing care for heryounger siblings.The patient had no objection to his sister providing this care, but heinsisted that she not be told that he had tested HIV positive. Though he hadalways had a good relationship with his sister, she did not know that he was anactive homosexual. His even greater fear was that his father would hear of hishomosexual orientation and lifestyle. Homosexuality is generally looked uponwith extreme disfavor among Hispanics.The patient's physician is bound by his code of ethics that places a very high priority on keeping confidentiality. That is, information about someone'smedical condition that he or she does not want known cannot be divulged bythe physician. Some would argue that the responsibility of confidentiality is evengreater with HIV/AIDS since disclosure of someone's homosexuality normallycarries devastating personal consequences for the individual who is forced "outof the closet."On the other hand, the patient's sister is putting herself at risk by providingnursing care for him. Doesn't she have a right to know the risks to which she issubjecting herself, especially since she willingly volunteered to take care of herbrother?If you were the physician, what would you do in this case? Would youbreach the norm of confidentiality to protect the patient's sister, or would youkeep confidentiality in order to protect the patient from harm that would cometo him from his other family members, especially his father?Perhaps as good a question as "what would you do" in this situation is thequestion, "how would you decide what to do" in this situation? The process ofmaking a moral decision can be as important as the decision itself, and manyethical decisions that people encounter are so complex that it is easy to exhaustoneself talking around the problem without actually making any progresstoward resolving it. The response to many moral dilemmas is "where do I start?'and the person who is faced with these decisions often needs direction that willenable him or her to move constructively toward resolution and "see the forestfor the trees."In order to adequately address the ethical dilemmas that peopleencounter regularly, the following is a model that can be used to ensure that allthe necessary bases are covered. This is not a formula that will automaticallygenerate the "right" answer to an ethical problem. Rather it is a guideline that isdesigned to make sure that all the right questions are being asked in the processof ethical deliberation.​</h2><br />

                            19. Writer Allison Levy worked alone. While she liked the freedom and flexibility of working from home, she sometimes missed having a community of coworkers, both for the practical purpose of brainstorming and the more social “water cooler” aspect. Levy did what many do in the Internet age: she found a group of other writers online through a web forum. Over time, a group of approximately twenty writers, who all wrote for a similar audience, broke off from the larger forum and started a private invitation-only forum. While writers in general represent all genders, ages, and interests, it ended up being a collection of twenty- and thirty-something women who comprised the new forum; they all wrote fiction for children and young adults.
At first, the writers’ forum was clearly a secondary group united by the members’ professions and work situations. As Levy explained, “On the Internet, you can be present or absent as often as you want. No one is expecting you to show up.” It was a useful place to research information about different publishers and about who had recently sold what and to track industry trends. But as time passed, Levy found it served a different purpose. Since the group shared other characteristics beyond their writing (such as age and gender), the online conversation naturally turned to matters such as child-rearing, aging parents, health, and exercise. Levy found it was a sympathetic place to talk about any number of subjects, not just writing. Further, when people didn’t post for several days, others expressed concern, asking whether anyone had heard from the missing writers. It reached a point where most members would tell the group if they were traveling or needed to be
The group continued to share. One member on the site who was going through a difficult family illness wrote, “I don’t know where I’d be without you women. It is so great to have a place to vent that I know isn’t hurting anyone.”
