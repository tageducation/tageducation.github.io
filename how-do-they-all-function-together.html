                                            TRUE OR FALSE. 1. In structural functionalism, individual institutions work together in service of thewhole.2. The method of functionalism was based on fieldwork and direct observations ofsocieties,3. The parts of the society that Maslow referred to were the social institutions orpatterns of beliefs and behaviors focused on meeting social needs.4. Functionalism emphasizes the importance of the economy for any society, and theincome and self-fulfillment that work often provides.5. Herbert Spencer was concerned with how elements of society were functional fora society as well as social order.6. Structural functionalists goal is to find out what something actually does in apolitical system, as opposed to what it is supposed to do.7. A general conceptual diagram of structural functionalism shows that all of thedifferent organizations and institutions in society are interdependent.8. A retreatism is a combination of the rejection of societal goals and means and asubstitutions of other goals and means.9. Conformity occurs when an individual continues to do things as prescribed bysociety but forfeits the achievement of the goals.10. Ritualism involves the rejection of both the culturally prescribed goals as well asthe conventional means of attaining them.​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Organs Functioning Together
<p>
</p><p>The <strong>organs </strong>inside the body are functioning together because of how our body was designed. Organs of the same system have similar roles, and that is why they are grouped together as one. There are two organ system inside the body that work very closely together – the circulatory system and the cardiovascular system.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>
It is important to take care of our body, and we need to make sure that we have a functioning organ system. We can achieve it by eating health food, and avoiding junk food that is filled with salt and preservatives. Eating too much junk food will destroy our body over time.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Yes, because cell organelles must work together to carry out protein synthesis, utilize proteins within the cell, and transport them out of the cell.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>yes, the cells that make up all organisms are highly organized structures, specifically designed to carry out processes necessary for life. The simplest cells belong to prokaryotes such as bacteria. The cells of eukaryotes, which are animals, plants, fungi and protists, are more complex. Within each eukaryotic cell, specialized structures called organelles work together to perform all life functions. One of the most important functions in the cell is making and processing proteins. Several organelles are directly involved in protein synthesis, while others provide support by performing ancillary duties necessary to keep the cell functioning properly for protein synthesis to occur.</p><p></p><p></p><p>carry on learning</p><br />

                            26. TRUE OR FALSE. 1. In structural functionalism, individual institutions work together in service of thewhole.2. The method of functionalism was based on fieldwork and direct observations ofsocieties,3. The parts of the society that Maslow referred to were the social institutions orpatterns of beliefs and behaviors focused on meeting social needs.4. Functionalism emphasizes the importance of the economy for any society, and theincome and self-fulfillment that work often provides.5. Herbert Spencer was concerned with how elements of society were functional fora society as well as social order.6. Structural functionalists goal is to find out what something actually does in apolitical system, as opposed to what it is supposed to do.7. A general conceptual diagram of structural functionalism shows that all of thedifferent organizations and institutions in society are interdependent.8. A retreatism is a combination of the rejection of societal goals and means and asubstitutions of other goals and means.9. Conformity occurs when an individual continues to do things as prescribed bysociety but forfeits the achievement of the goals.10. Ritualism involves the rejection of both the culturally prescribed goals as well asthe conventional means of attaining them.​</h2><br />
