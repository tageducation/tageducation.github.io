Were you able to label all the stages of star? Review the hints/clues in the previous activity. You will notice that following the sequence will reveal what happens in each stage of star.
To understand further, answer the following questions below.
1. What element from space is pulled by gravity and turn into a protostar?
2. What will happen if a low massive main sequence star runs out of hydrogen fuel?
3. How are heavy elements such as Carbon, Oxygen and Neon formed during star formation?
4. Why is it impossible for any matter such as light and radiation to escape from a black hole?
5. Why do you think massive star has shorter life span than average star?</h2><br />
                        <p></p><p>[tex]ANSWER:[/tex]</p>ABCAAC (nuclear fusion)ACCDAAABC<p></p>Hydrogen gas is typically the element from space that is pulled by gravity and turns into a protostar.When a low massive main sequence star runs out of hydrogen fuel, it will eventually shrink and cool, becoming a white dwarf.Heavy elements such as Carbon, Oxygen, and Neon are formed during star formation through the process of nuclear fusion in the cores of stars, where lighter elements are fused together to form heavier ones.It is impossible for any matter such as light and radiation to escape from a black hole because of its immense gravitational pull, which is so strong that it warps the fabric of spacetime itself, creating an event horizon beyond which anything that crosses it can no longer escape.Massive stars have shorter life spans than average stars because they burn through their fuel much faster, producing intense radiation and eventually exploding as supernovae, which disperse their elements into the surrounding space. This process is more intense in massive stars due to their higher temperatures and densities, leading to a shorter lifespan.<p></p><p>SOURCE:https://openai.com</p><p></p><p></p><br />
