Select one:

c. Short
d. Long</h2><br />
                        <p>The answer is <strong>B. Cyclical</strong>. <strong>Inuits, Africans, and some Asians see time as cyclical</strong>. Time that is cyclical is a time that follows a cycle. For example, the sun rises and sets, the seasons come and rotate as a set, old regenerate through their children, etc. This is cyclical, and this is how Inuits, Africans, and some Asians see time. </p>Explanation of Cyclical Time From the word "cyclic" itself, it came from the word "cycle". This "<strong>Cyclical Time</strong>" reflects the mindset that time is a cycle. For example, time measurement are in cycles: seven days in a week, 24 hours in a day, 60 minutes in an hour, and 60 seconds in a minute. The cycle repeats itself. Moreover, common events are in cycles: sun rises and sets, the seasons come and rotate as a set, old regenerate through their children, etc. This is how Inuits, Africans, and some Asians see time. Linear Time vs. Cyclical Time <p>As opposed to cyclical time, there is also linear time. Here are their brief definitions: </p>Linear Time - Time involves only one direction. It is not possible to go back in time. Cyclical Time - Time evolves in a cycle, as explained above. <p>Those are the details about <strong>cyclical time, which is how Inuits, Africans, and some Asians see time</strong>.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>While Africa may be the oldest inhabited continent on Earth, it still lags behind the others in terms of infrastructure. To compensate for that, it has a huge number of attractions that make it worth all the frustrations that tourists can feel from time to time as they travel around. Where else in the world are there vast plains where wild animals roam free? The stunning coastline, especially on the Indian Ocean side, has mile after mile of beautiful beach with the warm crystal waters very enticing. Inevitably, such a vast continent with several degrees of latitude either side of the Equator has a huge variety. The Northern Coastline is the Mediterranean and Arabic while the Southern Tip is where the Indian Ocean meets the Atlantic Water coming straight up from the Antarctic. That water does not warm up significantly until it approaches the Equator on Africa’s West Coast.</p><p></p><p>In contrast, Asia, with the largest continental population of all and certainly an even longer coastline, can boast the most impressive mountain range in the world, the Himalayas, a huge variety of climates and cuisines that have spread all over the world. Asia has made more impact on the rest of the world than Africa which is still a place where exploration proved extremely difficult and even today, the influence of the world’s most powerful nations and 21st Century life are patchy. For some travellers, that is part of Africa’s charm and one of the reasons why it is a destination well worth visiting. </p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>sana po makatulong</p><br />

In the U.S., Asians share a long and well-documented history of discrimination and have been the frequent targets of both interpersonal and structural persecution. Asians of all ethnicities have been scapegoated, verbally attacked with racial slurs, coughed at, spat on, physically assaulted and more.<p></p>Observers may consider such acts as just small slights or brief episodes that can be shrugged off. But there is strong evidence that they can have much more serious effects than most people realize, especially on people who are already vulnerable.<p></p>In their commentary, Chen and his collaborators provide an overview of the history of anti-Asian discrimination in the United States, reviewing associations between discrimination and health, describing the associated public health implications of the COVID-19 pandemic and reviewing evidence from previous disasters in U.S. history that were "racialized."<p></p>The scope of the problem is large and growing.

                            16. how does african literature survive in times of african slavery and oppression</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>African American literature is the body of literature produced in the United States by writers of African descent. It begins with the works of such late 18th-century writers as Phillis Wheatley. Before the high point of slave narratives, African-American literature was dominated by autobiographical spiritual narratives. The genre known as slave narratives in the 19th century were accounts by people who had generally escaped from slavery, about their journeys to freedom and ways they claimed their lives. The Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s was a great period of flowering in literature and the arts, influenced both by writers who came North in the Great Migration and those who were immigrants from Jamaica and other Caribbean islands. African American writers have been recognized by the highest awards, including the Nobel Prize given to Toni Morrison in 1993. Among the themes and issues explored in this literature are the role of African Americans within the larger American society, African-American culture, racism, slavery, and social equality. African-American writing has tended to incorporate oral forms, such as spirituals, sermons, gospel music, blues, or rap.[1]</p><p></p><p>As African Americans' place in American society has changed over the centuries, so has the focus of African-American literature. Before the American Civil War, the literature primarily consisted of memoirs by people who had escaped from slavery; the genre of slave narratives included accounts of life under slavery and the path of justice and redemption to freedom. There was an early distinction between the literature of freed slaves and the literature of free blacks born in the North. Free blacks expressed their oppression in a different narrative form. Free blacks in the North often spoke out against slavery and racial injustices by using the spiritual narrative. The spiritual addressed many of the same themes of slave narratives, but has been largely ignored in current scholarly conversation.[2]</p><p></p><p>At the turn of the 20th century, non-fiction works by authors such as W. E. B. Du Bois and Booker T. Washington debated how to confront racism in the United States. During the Civil Rights Movement, authors such as Richard Wright and Gwendolyn Brooks wrote about issues of racial segregation and black nationalism. Today, African-American literature has become accepted as an integral part of American literature, with books such as Roots: The Saga of an American Family by Alex Haley, The Color Purple (1982) by Alice Walker, which won the Pulitzer Prize; and Beloved by Toni Morrison achieving both best-selling and award-winning status.</p><p></p><p>In broad terms, African-American literature can be defined as writings by people of African descent living in the United States. It is highly varied.[3] African-American literature has generally focused on the role of African Americans within the larger American society and what it means to be an American.[4] As Princeton University professor Albert J. Raboteau has said, all African-American literary study "speaks to the deeper meaning of the African-American presence in this nation. This presence has always been a test case of the nation's claims to freedom, democracy, equality, the inclusiveness of all."[4] African American literature explores the issues of freedom and equality long denied to Blacks in the United States, along with further themes such as African-American culture, racism, religion, slavery, a sense of home,[5] segregation, migration, feminism, and more. African-American literature presents experience from an African-American point of view. In the early Republic, African-American literature represented a way for free blacks to negotiate their identity in an individualized republic. They often tried to exercise their political and social autonomy in the face of resistance from the white public.[6] Thus, an early theme of African-American literature was, like other American writings, what it meant to be a citizen in post-Revolutionary America.</p><br />

But there is strong evidence that they can have much more serious effects than most people realize, especially on people who are already vulnerable.</p><p>In their commentary, Chen and his collaborators provide an overview of the history of anti-Asian discrimination in the United States, reviewing associations between discrimination and health, describing the associated public health implications of the COVID-19 pandemic and reviewing evidence from previous disasters in U.S. history that were "racialized."</p><p>The scope of the problem is large and growing. Asian Americans comprise just 5.6 percent of the US population. However, they are the fastest-growing racial/ethnic group in the country, with a 72 percent increase from 2001 to 2015, and are projected to become the largest immigrant group by 2055.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>HOPE IT HELPS</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>AFRICANS</p><p>Parent and peer relationships are important social resources for adolescents. South African research on adolescents' relationships, however, underemphasises these relationships as potential positive resources. Studies also tend to use samples from urban populations, while rural and semi-rural adolescent populations are neglected. This study focused on White and Coloured adolescents living in one South African semi-rural community and their ratings of positive and negative relationship qualities in relationships with parents and peers. Using the Network of Relationships Inventory (NRI), we found that mothers, best friends and romantic partners were relatively equal sources of social support. Mothers' high ratings for support, conflict and punishment may point to mothers bearing the primary responsibility for child care. Fathers' low support ratings raise concern as father involvement is important for adolescents' well-being. White participants overall rated their relationship higher for support and lower for negative qualities than the Coloured participants.</p><br />
