                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Two (2) good habits which I can relate to myself and explain how they will help to improve your self-discipline. 1. Always be respectful and considerate to others by setting a reasonable timetable.<p>Our lives require structure and routine. Our bodies are used to it. They work best when we stick to a regular schedule. We need to eat and sleep at roughly the same times every day. It is your responsibility as a parent to instill this habit in your child at a young age. This routine follows a person throughout their life and aids in the development of good work habits. Make a plan that works for you and stick to it!</p><p></p>2. Create good study habits by being responsible and accountable to your actions and decisions.<p>Effective study is a skill. Lifelong learners are people who live their lives to the fullest. They are never afraid to try new things. It is necessary to study and acquire new information in an effective and efficient manner. Learning how to study and acquire the knowledge needed to succeed does not happen by accident. It must be taught. Take a study skills course or seek advice from others on how to improve your study habits.</p><p></p>Two Human Rights that could help me practice self-discipline:1. Every child has the right to education
<p>Situation: I will make sure to study well and learn more things that will help my growth as an individual.  </p>2. Live in a safe community
<p>Situation: I will make sure that all community members I am surrounded with are good individuals and if not, I will try my best to look for a more positive environment.</p><p></p><p>What is the relationship of self control to self disciplines: https://brainly.ph/question/2018570</p><p>Discipline and self control: https://brainly.ph/question/2774359</p><p></p><p><strong>#BrainlyEveryday</strong></p><br />

Then choose rights that canserve as your reminder to always practice self-discipline. Cite an example situation foreach night.                          please answer my question ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>we need forgiveness and God</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>1. Forgiveness</p><p></p><p>When we spend a large portion of our days in a state of anger, regret, or guilt, we create more problems than we do solutions. Hate and anger consumes far more energy than love and forgiveness. When we forgive, we learn to let go of certain things.</p><p></p><p>Without the habit of forgiveness, we couldn’t achieve self-discipline. We’re too worried about how someone wronged us to even focus on discipline or achieving our goals.</p><p></p><p>If someone hurt you, learn to forgive them. It doesn’t necessarily mean you have to forget. Just forgive and release that negative energy back in to the universe.</p><p></p><p>By forgiving, we let go of negativity that zaps our ability to be self-disciplined. If you want to learn how to discipline yourself, forgiveness is surely one major avenue. While it might not seem like a discipline habit at first glance, it’s one of the most important ones that exists.</p><p></p><p>Think about all the people that you’re angry with or that have wronged you, and write down why you forgive them. Try to put yourself in their shoes. What would you have done in their situation? Try to find some humor in it. Try to find a lesson learned in all that transpired.</p><p></p><p>I know firsthand just how hard it is to forgive some people, especially those that have really wronged me in life. But it wasn’t until I let go of all those feelings of hurt and animosity before things really started to improve. I was so busy worrying and stressing, that I wasn’t really pushing forward.</p><p></p><p>2. GOD</p><p></p><p>It’s good to have a set time to pray especially in the morning before your day gets started. Yet we must also develop the habit of praying to God all throughout the day as well. A continual on-going conversation with God will keep you close to the Spirit’s leading and direction in your life. It’s doesn’t have to always be audible, but a quiet spiritual connection that’s never broken</p><br />
