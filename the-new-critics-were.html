                                            Directions: Below is an argument about television. Break down the arguments of the essay by filling in the table below. Television news has a serious failing: It's show business. Unlike a newspaper, its every image has to entertain people. To score high ratings and win advertisers, the visual medium favors the spectacular riots, tornadoes, air crashes. "The more you can get data out instantly," says media critic Jeff Greenfield. In 1996, as American missiles bombed military sites in Iraq, President Clinton held a press conference to explain the action. His lengthy remarks were clipped to twenty seconds on broadcast on one news broadcast, and then an anchor-woman digested the opposition to a single line: "Republicans tonight were critical of the president's actions." Americans who rely on their television for news (two thirds, according to the recent polls) exist of a starvation diet. Thesis/Claims Evidence Explanation Is the Argument Valid? Why or why not?​</a>

This is how the Department of Health would describe the general situation of COVID-19 cases in the country nearly 9 months since the pandemic started. Average new cases reported in a single day over the past few weeks have hovered below 2,000.
"In general terms for the whole country, the trend is plateauing and critical care is at moderate risk," Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vegeire said in a press briefing.
Zooming into some areas, however, Vergeire said officials were monitoring recent increase in cases in areas including Davao City and Cebu City</a>

                            13. Directions: Below is an argument about television. Break down the arguments of the essay by filling in the table below. Television news has a serious failing: It's show business. Unlike a newspaper, its every image has to entertain people. To score high ratings and win advertisers, the visual medium favors the spectacular riots, tornadoes, air crashes. "The more you can get data out instantly," says media critic Jeff Greenfield. In 1996, as American missiles bombed military sites in Iraq, President Clinton held a press conference to explain the action. His lengthy remarks were clipped to twenty seconds on broadcast on one news broadcast, and then an anchor-woman digested the opposition to a single line: "Republicans tonight were critical of the president's actions." Americans who rely on their television for news (two thirds, according to the recent polls) exist of a starvation diet. Thesis/Claims Evidence Explanation Is the Argument Valid?
