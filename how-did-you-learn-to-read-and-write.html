                            22. how did you learn to read and write​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>To be able to learn how to read you must be taught. Most people learn to read at a young age so they are taught by another but even an adult will need instruction to a certain extent. There is simply no other way to learn to read other than with a teacher.
</p><p>
</p><p>I learnt when I was about four years old at primary school. Firstly, I learnt the alphabet by being able to recognise how each letter sounded.
</p><p>
</p><p>After that, I practised how to actually write these letters. I can remember it was quite difficult for my tiny hands to be able to scribe these shapes as I was instructed but once the class and I mastered this we moved on to reading.
</p><p>
</p><p>I can't remember this part but I imagine we were taught basic words such as ‘cat’, ‘bus’, ‘girl’ and ‘boy as well as connectives. Having been given a book to read, the teacher would point to each individual word as she spoke. Over time I guess we were encouraged to do the same and so we learnt how to read at a basic degree.
</p><p>
</p><p>As the years progressed and we got older, we moved onto more complex books and learnt how to use the language we knew to our will. For instance, being able to write persuasively or descriptively. As an avid reader I was reading works such as George Orwell when I was nine….even if I didn't realise Animal Farm was a metaphor for the Russian revolution until my dad told me.
</p><p>
</p><p>Reading is essentially a long process which takes years to develop but is highly beneficial as language is the way we communicate information to one another. Being able to read heightens this ability. Hope this helped.
