                                            TAMA O MALI1. Ayon kay Dr. Florentino Hornedo, ang tao ay isinakatawang diwa, mayroon siyang materyal at espiritwal nadimensiyon.2. Ang kalikasang espiritwal ay nagbibigay ng kakayahang kumilos o gumawa nang nararapat upang mapanatilingmapaunlad ang pamumuhay.3. Ang kalikasang materyal ang nagbibigay ng kakayahang magpasiya patungo sa katotohanan at kabutihan4. Ang kamalayan o consciousness ay mahalaga upang makaramdam ang tao at maging gising sa mga bagay-bagay5. Ang pagpapakatao ay pagsasabuhay ng hindi angkop na pag-iisip, pagpapasiya, pagkilos na nararapat atnaaayon sa kalikasan ng tao.6. Ang karunungan ay bunga ng nahubog na isip at kilos-loob batay sa katotohanan.7. Ang edukasyon ay nagbibigay sa tao ng kakayahang magpasiya at kumilos nang nararapat sa kaniyangkayamanan8. Napakahalaga ng mga pangaral na mababasa sa Banal na Kasulatan o Koran dahil napapaloob dito ang mgaaral ng katotohanan at immoral na batayan ng pamumuhay.9. Ang isip ay umuunawa tungo sa katotohanan at ang kilos-loob ay kumikilos tungo sa kabutihan10. Ang katotohanan ay naipakikita sa mga kabutihan at ito ay natatamo sa pagkakaroon ng mga prinsipyo sabuhay11. According to Catechism of the Catholic Church (CCC 2559, 2265), prayer is a vital and personalrelationship with the living God.12. To understand the meaning of prayer, we must first believe that God Allah exists, and that He is not abeing, who can be addressed and who responds.13. The conversation of prayer deepens our intimacy with God Allah by drawing us into the communication withHim that leads to ultimate communion.14. Saint Teresa of Avila says, "the will becomes united in some way with the will of God.”15. Adoring the Lord means offering Him the affections of your heart and paying honor to Him for His mightypower, wisdom, strength, goodness, mercy and love.16. ACTS stands for Adoration, Confession, Thanksgiving and Suffer17. God Allah forgives sins and people were made new and more like Jesus through confession18. Thanksgiving part in prayer is not essential because we already thank God in the mass.19. Supplication is a request and if the request is made to God Allah it becomes a prayer.20. Prayer is a form of service.THANK YOU GUYS​</a>

                            15. TAMA O MALI1. Ayon kay Dr. Florentino Hornedo, ang tao ay isinakatawang diwa, mayroon siyang materyal at espiritwal nadimensiyon.2. Ang kalikasang espiritwal ay nagbibigay ng kakayahang kumilos o gumawa nang nararapat upang mapanatilingmapaunlad ang pamumuhay.3. Ang kalikasang materyal ang nagbibigay ng kakayahang magpasiya patungo sa katotohanan at kabutihan4. Ang kamalayan o consciousness ay mahalaga upang makaramdam ang tao at maging gising sa mga bagay-bagay5. Ang pagpapakatao ay pagsasabuhay ng hindi angkop na pag-iisip, pagpapasiya, pagkilos na nararapat atnaaayon sa kalikasan ng tao.6. Ang karunungan ay bunga ng nahubog na isip at kilos-loob batay sa katotohanan.7. Ang edukasyon ay nagbibigay sa tao ng kakayahang magpasiya at kumilos nang nararapat sa kaniyangkayamanan8. Napakahalaga ng mga pangaral na mababasa sa Banal na Kasulatan o Koran dahil napapaloob dito ang mgaaral ng katotohanan at immoral na batayan ng pamumuhay.9. Ang isip ay umuunawa tungo sa katotohanan at ang kilos-loob ay kumikilos tungo sa kabutihan10. Ang katotohanan ay naipakikita sa mga kabutihan at ito ay natatamo sa pagkakaroon ng mga prinsipyo sabuhay11. According to Catechism of the Catholic Church (CCC 2559, 2265), prayer is a vital and personalrelationship with the living God.12. To understand the meaning of prayer, we must first believe that God Allah exists, and that He is not abeing, who can be addressed and who responds.13. The conversation of prayer deepens our intimacy with God Allah by drawing us into the communication withHim that leads to ultimate communion.14. Saint Teresa of Avila says, "the will becomes united in some way with the will of God.”15. Adoring the Lord means offering Him the affections of your heart and paying honor to Him for His mightypower, wisdom, strength, goodness, mercy and love.16. ACTS stands for Adoration, Confession, Thanksgiving and Suffer17. God Allah forgives sins and people were made new and more like Jesus through confession18. Thanksgiving part in prayer is not essential because we already thank God in the mass.19. Supplication is a request and if the request is made to God Allah it becomes a prayer.20. Prayer is a form of service.THANK YOU GUYS​</h2><br />

Share the difficulties you have encountered in the course of your study, what you will do differently and how. If the conclusion refutes the hypothesis, then reject the hypothesis, accept its counterhypothesis, and then recommend other ways of solving your problem.​</h2><br />
