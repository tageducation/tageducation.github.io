Listento the editorial excerpt inside the box, then answer the question thatWhy the lack of trust on the vaccine?ISN'T it everyone's wish this 2021 for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) togo away so we can resume our lives? So why is there a lot of talk about nottrusting the vaccines that are set to be rolled out later this year?Another reason is how the government is not answering the questions ontwo vaccines they are acquiring. Aside from Pfizer and AstraZeneca, thegovernment has negotiated for Sputnik v vaccine from Russian's andCoronaVac from China's Sinovac. These two vaccines have not been subjectto peer review, and only have press releases to back their claim of high efficacy.Concerns about vaccine safety are true and legit. That is why members ofthe Philippine medical community are speaking out. They say what is neededis to be transparent, to communicate, explain, and make people understandhow vaccines work. Explain that all vaccines do have side effects, but thebenefits outweigh the negatives. They admit this coronavirus and the vaccineare new ground, but these values can save lives. To do that is to listen toscience, and not to salesmen, and that will help us make a better choice.Source: Tyrone Velez-Why the Lackof Trust on the Vaccine, Sunstar Tybox, January 19, 2021https://www.sunstar.com.ph/article/1883283/Davao/OpinionNelez-Why-the-lack-of-trust-on-the-vaccine6.

Despite recent concerns related to the costs created by illegal and some legal immigration to the United States, this country has largely benefited from the skills, talents, and ambition that immigrants bring with them. American businesses gain from a good source of affordable labor, while towns and cities are revitalized by immigrant families who strengthen communities through civic participation and the generation of new economic activity. The United States must continue to welcome new arrivals and help those who are alreadyhere; otherwise, the country will lose the advantages it has over other industrialized countries who compete against us in the global marketplace and seek to recruit from a vast pool of unskilled and skilled global workers,2. All toilet flush tanks work about the same. When the toilet is flushed, the trip handle lifts the tank ball, opening the outlet and letting water flow into the bowl. When the tank is nearly empty, the ball falls back in place over the outlet. The float falls with the water level, opening the water-supply inlet valve just as the outlet is being closed, and the tank is refilled through the filler tube. Water also flows through the bowl refill tube into the overflow pipe to replenish trap-sealing water. As the water level in the tank nears the top of the overflow pipe, the float closes the inlet valve, completing the cycle.3. It's been almost ten years since I first ran for political office. I was thirty-five at the time, four years out of law school, recently married, and generally impatient with life. A seat in the Illinois legislature had opened up, and several friends suggested that I run, thinking that my work as a civil rights lawyer, and contacts from my days as a community organizer, would make me a viable candidate. After discussing it with my wife, I entered the race and proceeded to do what every first-time candidate does: I talked to anyone who would listen. I went to block club meetings and church socials, beauty shops and barbershops. If two guys were standing on a corner, I would cross the street to hand them campaign literature. And everywhere I went, I'd get some version of the same two questions.4. Sunset is the time of day when our sky meets the outer space solar winds. There are blue, pink, and purple swirls, spinning and twisting, like clouds of balloons caught in a whirlwind. The sun moves slowly to hide behind the line of horizon, while the moon races to take its place in prominence atop the night sky. People slow to a crawl, entranced, fully forgetting the deeds that must still be done. There is a coolness, a calmness, when the sun does set.​</a>

                                             According to legend, there was a time
when the gods could live like ordinary
mortals do. Although these gods were
enchanted, they could speak, love, and
even go to the market like what people
do in our time. This story tells what
happened to the daughter of two such
deities. This is the story of Mariang
Makiling.
Two deities, Dayang Makiling and Gat Panahon, had an only
daughter named Maria. Because of her beauty and charm, she was
the delight of her parents. The source of their joy and strength,
Maria was, to them, a jewel, a treasure that made life full of light
and laughter. At that time people could talk with the deities face to
face, and even sit with them side by side underneath a tree. People
could also ask for help when they were in need, provided that they
asked in a solemn manner. It was the custom of Maria to go to a
small market, sometimes called talipapa, on weekdays. Just like
other women, she would on such occasions wear clothes made of
silk and embroidered with flowers and wide stripes for this was the
fashion at that time. Maria had long, black abundant hair which she
usually decorated with pomelo flowers. When she went to the
market, her flowing hair would touch her ankles. As she passed
along, gallant men would bow their heads to signify their respect.
When Maria went to the market, she was always
accompanied by two Aetas, who served as her
servants. These two servants stayed close behind
Maria, and they both carried a basket each that
was full of golden ginger. These golden ginger
Maria would barter for such items needed for the
home. There was no money at that time, and
instead of buying, people bartered and exchanged
their goods for the things that they needed. On a
market day, the residents of the area are not the
only ones who would go to the talipapa.
Merchants and people from neighboring towns
would also go to the market.
One day, Gat Dula, the ruler of the kingdom
of Bay, came to the talipapa to while away
the hours. A piece of animal skin with fine
hair caught Gat Dula's eye and he reached
out to touch the fur. At the same moment,
Maria was also reaching towards the same
piece of animal skin and their shoulders
accidentally touched. Their eyes met and
Gat Dula bowed his head as a sign of
respect and apology. And Maria responded
with a shy smile as they parted from each
other's company. Since that first encounter,
Gat Dula often visited the talipapa but he
was not able to see Maria during these visits.
One day, he saw Maria at the very place
where they first met. He approached Maria
and greeted her and Maria responded with
a very sweet smile. That was the beginning
of their friendship which blossomed into
love as the months passed. As time
passed, the love affair between Gat Dula
and Maria came to be known to Gat
Panahon, Maria's father. Gat Panahon was
angry. Even Dayang Makiling, Maria's
mother, was distressed that her only
daughter was in love with a mortal.
Maria was then forbidden to go down to earth. Her
parents even took away from Maria the power of
enchantment which enabled a deity to look and act like
an ordinary mortal. But even though Maria and Gat Dula
could no longer meet physically, their love endured.
Maria continued to watch over Gat Dula. During a battle
with the army of Lakan Bunto, the ruler of a neighboring
kingdom who invaded the kingdom of Bay, Gat Dula did
not suffer a single wound due to the support of Maria's
enchantment. Unfortunately, Gat Dula's inability to see
Maria caused him to fall ill and die. Maria asked the
gods to give her the soul of Gat Dula and her request was granted

The right pump sends blood through the lungs to pick up the vital oxygen needed by all the cells in the body. The left pump sends blood around the body to deliver oxygen. The blood then returns to the right pump and so on round and round the double loop of the circulatory system. The heart pushes blood into tubes called arteries, which carry the blood around the body. When the heart relaxes, it fills with blood that comes back from the body along floppy tubes called veins. A heartbeat occurs every time the heart squeezes and relaxes._____ 2.

Despite recent concerns related to the costs created by illegal and some legal immigration to the United States, this country has largely benefited from the skills, talents, and ambition that immigrants bring with them. American businesses gain from a good source of affordable labor, while towns and cities are revitalized by immigrant families who strengthen communities through civic participation and the generation of new economic activity. The United States must continue to welcome new arrivals and help those who are alreadyhere; otherwise, the country will lose the advantages it has over other industrialized countries who compete against us in the global marketplace and seek to recruit from a vast pool of unskilled and skilled global workers,2. All toilet flush tanks work about the same. When the toilet is flushed, the trip handle lifts the tank ball, opening the outlet and letting water flow into the bowl. When the tank is nearly empty, the ball falls back in place over the outlet. The float falls with the water level, opening the water-supply inlet valve just as the outlet is being closed, and the tank is refilled through the filler tube. Water also flows through the bowl refill tube into the overflow pipe to replenish trap-sealing water. As the water level in the tank nears the top of the overflow pipe, the float closes the inlet valve, completing the cycle.3. It's been almost ten years since I first ran for political office. I was thirty-five at the time, four years out of law school, recently married, and generally impatient with life. A seat in the Illinois legislature had opened up, and several friends suggested that I run, thinking that my work as a civil rights lawyer, and contacts from my days as a community organizer, would make me a viable candidate. After discussing it with my wife, I entered the race and proceeded to do what every first-time candidate does: I talked to anyone who would listen. I went to block club meetings and church socials, beauty shops and barbershops. If two guys were standing on a corner, I would cross the street to hand them campaign literature. And everywhere I went, I'd get some version of the same two questions.4. Sunset is the time of day when our sky meets the outer space solar winds. There are blue, pink, and purple swirls, spinning and twisting, like clouds of balloons caught in a whirlwind. The sun moves slowly to hide behind the line of horizon, while the moon races to take its place in prominence atop the night sky. People slow to a crawl, entranced, fully forgetting the deeds that must still be done. There is a coolness, a calmness, when the sun does set.​</h2><br />

                            19.  According to legend, there was a time
when the gods could live like ordinary
mortals do. Although these gods were
enchanted, they could speak, love, and
even go to the market like what people
do in our time. This story tells what
happened to the daughter of two such
deities. This is the story of Mariang
Makiling.
Two deities, Dayang Makiling and Gat Panahon, had an only
daughter named Maria. Because of her beauty and charm, she was
the delight of her parents. The source of their joy and strength,
Maria was, to them, a jewel, a treasure that made life full of light
and laughter. At that time people could talk with the deities face to
face, and even sit with them side by side underneath a tree. People
could also ask for help when they were in need, provided that they
asked in a solemn manner. It was the custom of Maria to go to a
small market, sometimes called talipapa, on weekdays. Just like
other women, she would on such occasions wear clothes made of
silk and embroidered with flowers and wide stripes for this was the
fashion at that time. Maria had long, black abundant hair which she
usually decorated with pomelo flowers. When she went to the
market, her flowing hair would touch her ankles. As she passed
along, gallant men would bow their heads to signify their respect.
When Maria went to the market, she was always
accompanied by two Aetas, who served as her
servants. These two servants stayed close behind
Maria, and they both carried a basket each that
was full of golden ginger. These golden ginger
Maria would barter for such items needed for the
home. There was no money at that time, and
instead of buying, people bartered and exchanged
their goods for the things that they needed. On a
market day, the residents of the area are not the
only ones who would go to the talipapa.
Merchants and people from neighboring towns
would also go to the market.
One day, Gat Dula, the ruler of the kingdom
of Bay, came to the talipapa to while away
the hours. A piece of animal skin with fine
hair caught Gat Dula's eye and he reached
out to touch the fur. At the same moment,
Maria was also reaching towards the same
piece of animal skin and their shoulders
accidentally touched. Their eyes met and
Gat Dula bowed his head as a sign of
respect and apology. And Maria responded
with a shy smile as they parted from each
other's company. Since that first encounter,
Gat Dula often visited the talipapa but he
was not able to see Maria during these visits.
One day, he saw Maria at the very place
where they first met. He approached Maria
and greeted her and Maria responded with
a very sweet smile. That was the beginning
of their friendship which blossomed into
love as the months passed. As time
passed, the love affair between Gat Dula
and Maria came to be known to Gat
Panahon, Maria's father. Gat Panahon was
angry. Even Dayang Makiling, Maria's
mother, was distressed that her only
daughter was in love with a mortal.
Maria was then forbidden to go down to earth. Her
parents even took away from Maria the power of
enchantment which enabled a deity to look and act like
an ordinary mortal. But even though Maria and Gat Dula
could no longer meet physically, their love endured.
Maria continued to watch over Gat Dula. During a battle
with the army of Lakan Bunto, the ruler of a neighboring
kingdom who invaded the kingdom of Bay, Gat Dula did
not suffer a single wound due to the support of Maria's
enchantment. Unfortunately, Gat Dula's inability to see
Maria caused him to fall ill and die. Maria asked the
gods to give her the soul of Gat Dula and her request was granted
