                                            Science; Quarter 1 module 2Laws of MotionMotion has been studied for centuries by many great minds. Aristotle (284 – 322 B.C.) for example, believed that a moving object needs a continuous application of force to keep it moving. To him, an object is naturally at rest. He believed that the greater the force on the object, the greater is its speed. He introduced the idea of impetus that keeps a body in motion. John Philoponus (550 A.D.) conceptualized the idea of surrounding force similar to inertia found in Galileo’s idea and Newton’s First Law of Motion. He first introduced “Theory of Impetus”, a concept similar to force. According to the theory, when impetus decreases, the speed of the object also decreases. When that impetus is removed, the object stops moving. Jean Buridan (1300 -1358) also saw impetus as the cause of movement. He further developed the “Theory of Impetus” introduced by Philoponus. According to him, motion is possible through a “mover” that keeps the object moving with power proportional to the speed and mass of the object. When the mover is removed, the object stops moving. He later named impetus as force. Galileo Galilei (1564 – 1642), on the other hand, disagreed to Aristotle. He claimed that even without a continuous application of force, an object can continue to move with constant speed in a straight line provided there are no outside forces acting on it. Finally, Sir Isaac Newton (1643 – 1727) used Galileo’s ideas and eventually formulated the three laws of motion.Activity.1.2.3.4.5.​</a>

Isaac Newton, in full Sir Isaac Newton, (born December 25, 1642, Woolsthorpe, Lincolnshire, England. Isaac Newton died March 20, 1727, London),Isaac Newton is an English physicist and mathematician, who was the culminating figure of the Scientific Revolution of the 17th century. In optics, Isaac Newton's discovery of the composition of white light integrated the phenomena of colours into the science of light and laid the foundation for modern physical optics. In mechanics, Isaac Newton's three laws of motion, the basic principles of modern physics, resulted in the formulation of the law of universal gravitation. In mathematics, Isaac Newton was the original discoverer of the infinitesimal calculus. Isaac Newton was the only son of a local yeoman, also Isaac Newton, who had died three months before, and of Hannah Ayscough. That same year, at Arcetri near Florence, Galileo Galilei had died; Isaac Newton would eventually pick up his idea of a mathematical science of motion and bring his work to full fruition. A tiny and weak baby, Isaac Newton was not expected to survive his first day of life, much less 84 years. Deprived of a father before birth, Isaac Newton soon lost his mother as well, for within two years she married a second time; her husband, the well-to-do minister Barnabas Smith, left young Isaac with his grandmother and moved to a neighbouring village to raise a son and two daughters. For nine years, until the death of Barnabas Smith in 1653, Isaac was effectively separated from his mother, and his pronounced psychotic tendencies have been ascribed to this traumatic event. That Isaac Newton hated his stepfather we may be sure. When Isaac Newton examined the state of his soul in 1662 and compiled a catalog of sins in shorthand, Isaac Newton remembered “Threatening my father and mother Smith to burne them and the house over them.” The acute sense of insecurity that rendered him obsessively anxious when his work was published and irrationally violent when he defended it accompanied Isaac Newton throughout his life and can plausibly be traced to Isaac Newton's early years.

Material: pen Procedure: 1. Read the text below. in motion. Motion has been studied for centuries by many great minds. Aristotle (284 - 322 B.C.) for example, believed that a moving object needs a continuous application of force to keep it moving. To him, an object is naturally at rest. He believed that the greater the force on the object, the greater is its speed. He introduced the idea of impetus that keeps a body John Philoponus (550 A.D.) conceptualized the idea of surrounding force similar to inertia found in Galileo's idea and Newton's First Law of Motion. He first introduced "Theory of Impetus”, a concept similar to force. According to the theory, when impetus decreases, the speed of the object also decreases. When that impetus is removed, the object stops moving. Jean Buridan (1300 -1358) also saw impetus as the cause of movement. He further developed the “Theory of Impetus” introduced by Philoponus. According to him, motion is possible through a “mover" that keeps the object moving with power proportional to the speed and mass of the object. When the mover is removed, the object stops moving. He later named impetus as force. Galileo Galilei (1564 1642), on the other hand, disagreed to Aristotle. He claimed that even without a continuous application of force, an object can continue to move with constant speed in a straight line provided there are no outside forces acting on it. Finally, Sir Isaac Newton (1643 - 1727) used Galileo's ideas and eventually formulated the three laws of motion. -</a>

                            6. Science; Quarter 1 module 2Laws of MotionMotion has been studied for centuries by many great minds. Aristotle (284 – 322 B.C.) for example, believed that a moving object needs a continuous application of force to keep it moving. To him, an object is naturally at rest. He believed that the greater the force on the object, the greater is its speed. He introduced the idea of impetus that keeps a body in motion. John Philoponus (550 A.D.) conceptualized the idea of surrounding force similar to inertia found in Galileo’s idea and Newton’s First Law of Motion. He first introduced “Theory of Impetus”, a concept similar to force. According to the theory, when impetus decreases, the speed of the object also decreases. When that impetus is removed, the object stops moving. Jean Buridan (1300 -1358) also saw impetus as the cause of movement. He further developed the “Theory of Impetus” introduced by Philoponus. According to him, motion is possible through a “mover” that keeps the object moving with power proportional to the speed and mass of the object. When the mover is removed, the object stops moving. He later named impetus as force. Galileo Galilei (1564 – 1642), on the other hand, disagreed to Aristotle. He claimed that even without a continuous application of force, an object can continue to move with constant speed in a straight line provided there are no outside forces acting on it. Finally, Sir Isaac Newton (1643 – 1727) used Galileo’s ideas and eventually formulated the three laws of motion.Activity.1.2.3.4.5.​</h2><br />

Isaac Newton, in full Sir Isaac Newton, (born December 25, 1642, Woolsthorpe, Lincolnshire, England. Isaac Newton died March 20, 1727, London),Isaac Newton is an English physicist and mathematician, who was the culminating figure of the Scientific Revolution of the 17th century. In optics, Isaac Newton's discovery of the composition of white light integrated the phenomena of colours into the science of light and laid the foundation for modern physical optics. In mechanics, Isaac Newton's three laws of motion, the basic principles of modern physics, resulted in the formulation of the law of universal gravitation. In mathematics, Isaac Newton was the original discoverer of the infinitesimal calculus. Isaac Newton was the only son of a local yeoman, also Isaac Newton, who had died three months before, and of Hannah Ayscough. That same year, at Arcetri near Florence, Galileo Galilei had died; Isaac Newton would eventually pick up his idea of a mathematical science of motion and bring his work to full fruition. A tiny and weak baby, Isaac Newton was not expected to survive his first day of life, much less 84 years. Deprived of a father before birth, Isaac Newton soon lost his mother as well, for within two years she married a second time; her husband, the well-to-do minister Barnabas Smith, left young Isaac with his grandmother and moved to a neighbouring village to raise a son and two daughters. For nine years, until the death of Barnabas Smith in 1653, Isaac was effectively separated from his mother, and his pronounced psychotic tendencies have been ascribed to this traumatic event. That Isaac Newton hated his stepfather we may be sure. When Isaac Newton examined the state of his soul in 1662 and compiled a catalog of sins in shorthand, Isaac Newton remembered “Threatening my father and mother Smith to burne them and the house over them.” The acute sense of insecurity that rendered him obsessively anxious when his work was published and irrationally violent when he defended it accompanied Isaac Newton throughout his life and can plausibly be traced to Isaac Newton's early years.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.Newton's first law of motion states that there must be a cause—which is a net external force—for there to be any change in velocity, either a change in magnitude or direction. An object sliding across a table or floor slows down due to the net force of friction acting on the object.</p><p></p><p>2.Inertia is the tendency of an object to resist changes in its state of motion. ... Thus, inertia could be redefined as follows: Inertia = tendency of an object to resist changes in its velocity.</p><p></p><p>3.The force formula is defined by Newton's second law of motion: Force exerted by an object equals mass times acceleration of that object: F = m ⨉ a. To use this formula, you need to use SI units: Newtons for force, kilograms for mass, and meters per second squared for acceleration.</p><p></p><p>4.The SI unit of force is the newton, symbol N.

Material: pen Procedure: 1. Read the text below. in motion. Motion has been studied for centuries by many great minds. Aristotle (284 - 322 B.C.) for example, believed that a moving object needs a continuous application of force to keep it moving. To him, an object is naturally at rest. He believed that the greater the force on the object, the greater is its speed. He introduced the idea of impetus that keeps a body John Philoponus (550 A.D.) conceptualized the idea of surrounding force similar to inertia found in Galileo's idea and Newton's First Law of Motion. He first introduced "Theory of Impetus”, a concept similar to force. According to the theory, when impetus decreases, the speed of the object also decreases. When that impetus is removed, the object stops moving. Jean Buridan (1300 -1358) also saw impetus as the cause of movement. He further developed the “Theory of Impetus” introduced by Philoponus. According to him, motion is possible through a “mover" that keeps the object moving with power proportional to the speed and mass of the object. When the mover is removed, the object stops moving. He later named impetus as force. Galileo Galilei (1564 1642), on the other hand, disagreed to Aristotle. He claimed that even without a continuous application of force, an object can continue to move with constant speed in a straight line provided there are no outside forces acting on it. Finally, Sir Isaac Newton (1643 - 1727) used Galileo's ideas and eventually formulated the three laws of motion. -</h2><br />
