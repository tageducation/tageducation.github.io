                                            phrases/sentence      Language featuresDOH public to take part in measles and polio vaccination campaign, assures safety protocols in the immunization drive Press Release | October 18, 2020 The Department of Health (DOH) is encouraging the public to prioritize immunization from vaccine-preventable diseases through its upcoming Measles, Rubella and Oral Poliomyelitis Vaccine (MR-OPV) campaign which will be held from October 26 to November 25 in several regions. The implementation of health protocols during this campaign is also designed to prevent any inadvertent transmission of COVID-19. DOH Secretary Francisco T. Duque III said that the protection of children against measles, polio, and rubella are equally important during the time of COVID-19. He said, "We should be vigilant about other diseases that can affect some of our most vulnerable like infants and children, even during the COVID-19 pandemic. The child's first five years are very formative to his or her health. The illnesses we are vaccinating them against can be very damaging and will have repercussions on their growth and maturity. That is why we are urging parents not to take these conditions lightly, but must vaccinate their children as soon as possible." The vaccines used to counter measles, rubella, and polio have been proven safe for the past decades. "No child should have to suffer because of them, especially because the vaccines are free," said the DOH Secretary, At the same time, Sec. Duque also assured the public, especially parents, that the DOH is well aware of and will address their concerns about safety, saying, "We understand their fears of getting infected with COVID-19 if they go to our clinics to have their children vaccinated," he explained. "But we have committed ourselves to safety and the clinics will be making sure that health protocols are followed by healthcare workers and patients alike." Bicol (Region V) and MIMAROPA (Region IVB) will be the first locations for the program's implementation because of the need of the children in those areas to be vaccinated from the aforementioned diseases. The DOH is also setting the stage for the campaign's first phase which will cover Regions I, II, IVB, V, the Cordillera Administrative Region, and all of Mindanao. Safe and high quality measles-rubella vaccine (MR) and bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (bOPV) will be distributed for free, following safety measures. Children from 9-59 months old will be given the MR vaccine while those who are 0-59 months old will receive the bOPV. The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), which is dedicated to improving the lives of children and their families, also lent its support for the immunization program such as the acquisition of 19.2M doses of MR vaccine and 10M doses of oral poliovirus vaccines (OPV). UNICEF's consultants will also monitor that the local government units (LGU), have the necessary resources and instruction to succeed in the campaign. Syringes, safety collector boxes, surgical masks, and face shields will be allotted for the vaccination team and supervisors. Indelible inks for marking and reporting and recording forms, which are essential to campaign's operations, will also be rolled out to the different regions. Sec. Duque has asked for the public's participation for the vaccination campaigns for MR-OPV. He enthused, "We are grateful that many organizations are working together towards a common goal. With everyone working as one, we can ensure that Filipinos are as healthy as they can possibly be."

Children are particularly affected by the hunger crisis in Africa. there are far too many starving kids in Africa, every single affected kid is one too much. malnutrition leads to physical and mental development delays and disorders and is a major cause of high infant mortality rates in sub-Saharan Africa. according to UN data, 165 million children worldwide are too small for their age, or stunted, due to chronic malnutrition, three quarters of these children live in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia. in sub-Saharan Africa, 40% of children are affected; in south Asia, 39%.3.2 million children under the age of 5 die each year in sub-Saharan Africa- that's about half of world's deaths in this age group. worldwide, nearly every second death in children under the age of five is due to malnutrition. as this weakens the immune system, disease such as pneumonia, malaria or diarrhea often lead to death. the sub-Saharan child mortality rate is one of the highest in the world, with one in nine children dying before the age of 5. in Sierra Leone, one in every six children dies before the age of 5. especially young children die in Nigeria and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. example 1: EMPTY TUMMYLuck are you to have food very much different to me who can barely eat everyday? hunger is our enemy for it robs our future away please extend some help in our community never let us die because of our community never let us die because of our empty tummy answer: example 2: your help can save us. donate now and let us live. your answer: ​</a>

                        Heredity: Inheritance and Variation
Sex-Linked Genes
<p>Will any of their children have the disease?
</p><p><strong>Answer:	Yes.
</strong></p>No sons of a man with hemophilia will have hemophilia.
All daughters of a man with hemophilia will be carriers which often referred to as obligate carriers.
If a carrier has a son, the son has a 50% chance of having hemophilia.
If a carrier has a daughter, the daughter has a 50% chance of being a carrier.
Explanation:
<p>The probability or risks will be based on large numbers of births.  For example, if a man is a carrier and had two sons, we would expect that his two sons will not have hemophilia.  But in that group there would be women who had two sons with hemophilia, women who had one with and one without, and women with no sons with hemophilia.  The gene a child will inherit is based purely on chance and can never be truly predicted.
</p><p>A child's likelihoods of getting a hemophilia gene do not have anything to do with whether or not brothers or sisters have the gene.  Each time a mother got pregnant, her chances of having a child with the hemophilia gene are the same.  It is like rolling dice.  The results of one roll do not affect the next roll.
</p><p>A family may have children with the hemophilia gene and children without it.  It is also possible for all the children in the family to inherit the normal gene or all to inherit the hemophilia gene. For a mother who carries the hemophilia gene, the chances of giving birth to a child with hemophilia are the same for each pregnancy.  Even though she already has a child with hemophilia, she can still give birth to another.

                            17. phrases/sentence      Language featuresDOH public to take part in measles and polio vaccination campaign, assures safety protocols in the immunization drive Press Release | October 18, 2020 The Department of Health (DOH) is encouraging the public to prioritize immunization from vaccine-preventable diseases through its upcoming Measles, Rubella and Oral Poliomyelitis Vaccine (MR-OPV) campaign which will be held from October 26 to November 25 in several regions. The implementation of health protocols during this campaign is also designed to prevent any inadvertent transmission of COVID-19. DOH Secretary Francisco T. Duque III said that the protection of children against measles, polio, and rubella are equally important during the time of COVID-19. He said, "We should be vigilant about other diseases that can affect some of our most vulnerable like infants and children, even during the COVID-19 pandemic. The child's first five years are very formative to his or her health. The illnesses we are vaccinating them against can be very damaging and will have repercussions on their growth and maturity. That is why we are urging parents not to take these conditions lightly, but must vaccinate their children as soon as possible." The vaccines used to counter measles, rubella, and polio have been proven safe for the past decades. "No child should have to suffer because of them, especially because the vaccines are free," said the DOH Secretary, At the same time, Sec. Duque also assured the public, especially parents, that the DOH is well aware of and will address their concerns about safety, saying, "We understand their fears of getting infected with COVID-19 if they go to our clinics to have their children vaccinated," he explained. "But we have committed ourselves to safety and the clinics will be making sure that health protocols are followed by healthcare workers and patients alike." Bicol (Region V) and MIMAROPA (Region IVB) will be the first locations for the program's implementation because of the need of the children in those areas to be vaccinated from the aforementioned diseases. The DOH is also setting the stage for the campaign's first phase which will cover Regions I, II, IVB, V, the Cordillera Administrative Region, and all of Mindanao. Safe and high quality measles-rubella vaccine (MR) and bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (bOPV) will be distributed for free, following safety measures. Children from 9-59 months old will be given the MR vaccine while those who are 0-59 months old will receive the bOPV. The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), which is dedicated to improving the lives of children and their families, also lent its support for the immunization program such as the acquisition of 19.2M doses of MR vaccine and 10M doses of oral poliovirus vaccines (OPV). UNICEF's consultants will also monitor that the local government units (LGU), have the necessary resources and instruction to succeed in the campaign. Syringes, safety collector boxes, surgical masks, and face shields will be allotted for the vaccination team and supervisors. Indelible inks for marking and reporting and recording forms, which are essential to campaign's operations, will also be rolled out to the different regions. Sec. Duque has asked for the public's participation for the vaccination campaigns for MR-OPV. He enthused, "We are grateful that many organizations are working together towards a common goal. With everyone working as one, we can ensure that Filipinos are as healthy as they can possibly be."
