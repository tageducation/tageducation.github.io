                        Mother of Philippine Folk Dance<p></p><p><strong>Francisca Reyes-Aquino</strong>, affectionately known as the "Mother of <strong>Philippine Dance</strong>," dedicated her life to preserving Filipino culture by learning and instructing ethnic dances. Reyes-Aquino spent months traveling to various rural areas, including the barrios in Central and Northern Luzon, and studying the dances, activities, and even songs that were common there with a small team of researchers. Her thesis, Philippine Folk Dances and Games, which she published after completing her research in 1926 and which greatly assisted teachers and the majority of Filipinos in identifying "unrecorded forms" of regional dances, celebrations, and rites, was a great contribution to the field. She was recruited to lead a research team at the UP to find additional folk dances and teach them as a result. She visited Boston University to learn more about the discipline and returned with a passion for learning indigenous dances from Mindanao, Leyte, and Mountain Province.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>To know more about dance, visit the link below:</strong></p><p><strong>https://brainly.ph/question/2476610 </strong></p><p><strong>#SPJ4</strong></p><p></p><br />
