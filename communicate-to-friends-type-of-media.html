                                            Social Media and Depression by Nicole Ann B. Estrella Social media can be a serious threat to our mental health because it can cause depression. In an er when modern technology takes the lead, social media community is created. Through social media applications we can connect to our loved ones, we can find friends and we can express our views and opinions easily. Socme also helps students to learn in a whole new level. Regardless of how great this social media community is; it i still alarming to see how it increases the risk of having depression. In 2016 study of more than 450 teenagers, it was found that too much exposure to social media especially at night, investing too much emotion on it and letting ourselves out in its different platforms- wer each linked with worse sleep quality and higher levels of anxiety and depression. Aside from studies that can prove how social media caused depression, there are other reasons that w should consider. Social media users can suffer from the fear of missing out, isolation, insecurity, inferiorit complex, cyberbullying, etc. These negativities can also lead to anxiety and even worst, suicide. In conclusion, spending most of our time in social media will not bring us any good. Social media is reall dangerous for it can cause a grave threat to our mental state. We must prioritize our physical and mental health and avoid the toxic parts of this cyber world. 24. Type of Claim: 25 Claim or Topic sentence: 26. Reason: 27-28. Evidences:​</a>
