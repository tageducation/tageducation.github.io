My plan is to conduct interviews with those participants who are willing to be interviewed and give surveys using the same questions from the interviews to those participants who are really busy or not willing to be interviewed. For me to go on with this plan, I first need to know if this is okay to do. is it okay or should the questions be different?</a>

                                            What I Need to KnowIn this week’s lesson, you are to be introduced to the world of research as a discipline. Often, you hear your teachers ask you to do research on a certain assignment. Or you research to get information about a certain person, event, or a company. Sometimes, a problem needs to be studied carefully before a solution can be formulated. This process of carefully gathering information for whatever purpose it might serve is an example of a simple research.  At the end of this week, you are expected to: 1. define research;2. differentiate between inquiry and research;3. characterize research and enumerate the steps followed when conducting one;4. articulate the importance of research in daily life;5. share research experience and knowledge; 6. display a deeper appreciation for the value of research.pahelp po please​</a>

Research is time consuming and difficult to conduct.2. Identifying and limiting your respondents is the third step inconducting a research3. Being polite and respectful when interacting with your respondentsis a must in gathering data.4. Conducting a simple research helps you know more about thetrend, and demands of the market.5. Limiting the number of your respondents is a must since you cannotpossibly ask the total population of respondents.​</a>

Imagine that you’re planning to take a trip. You begin by choosing a destination, and then you may consider the following questions: How will I get there? Where will I stay? What do I want to do when I arrive?
Conducting research is like planning for a trip. You begin by choosing a topic, so you know where you are headed with your research. Then you consider research questions to narrow the focus of your research to a central idea.
Write two possible research topics that you’re interested in learning more about, and explain why you are interested in these topics. Then write three research questions about each topic.</a>

Often, you hear your teachers ask you to do research on a certain assignment. Or you research to get information about a certain person, event, or a company. Sometimes, a problem needs to be studied carefully before a solution can be formulated. This process of carefully gathering information for whatever purpose it might serve is an example of a simple research.  At the end of this week, you are expected to: 1. define research;2. differentiate between inquiry and research;3. characterize research and enumerate the steps followed when conducting one;4. articulate the importance of research in daily life;5. share research experience and knowledge; 6. display a deeper appreciation for the value of research.please help me​</a>

Often, you hear your teachers ask you to do research on a certain assignment. Or you research to get information about a certain person, event, or a company. Sometimes, a problem needs to be studied carefully before a solution can be formulated. This process of carefully gathering information for whatever purpose it might serve is an example of a simple research.  At the end of this week, you are expected to: 1. define research;2. differentiate between inquiry and research;3. characterize research and enumerate the steps followed when conducting one;4. articulate the importance of research in daily life;5. share research experience and knowledge; 6. display a deeper appreciation for the value of research.pahelp po please​</h2><br />

Imagine that you’re planning to take a trip. You begin by choosing a destination, and then you may consider the following questions: How will I get there? Where will I stay? What do I want to do when I arrive?
Conducting research is like planning for a trip. You begin by choosing a topic, so you know where you are headed with your research. Then you consider research questions to narrow the focus of your research to a central idea.
Write two possible research topics that you’re interested in learning more about, and explain why you are interested in these topics. Then write three research questions about each topic.</h2><br />
