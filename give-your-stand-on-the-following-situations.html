Some kids would play immediately, which is understandable, but the boy, no matter how tired he was after answering, immediately helped his father which is very admirable and people should learn after him.</p><p>2.

The information and skills you get from studying contributes to success but success isn't just about finishing your studies — it's about dedication, hardwork, and perseverance as well.</p><p>4. I agree with the statement. Proper exercise contributes to a healthy weight and lower the risk of some diseases. Eating fruits and vegetables, on the other hand, gives us vitamins and minerals that are essential and important for our bodies to receive. </p><p>5. Yes. This kind of people are the people who we should really keep in our lives for this behaviour shows that even if we are in our darkest and most vulnerable time in our life, they are still present and are willing to help and give us the comfort that we yearn and need.  </p><br />

Issue/Situation       Agree/Disagree Reason 1. Students must be given all considerations and shall be promoted to the next grade level even if they fail to comply the necessary academic requirements.2. Education is the primary key towards better future. 3. Quarantines bring more harm than benefits. 4. The government response to the COVID19 Pandemic is appropriate and effective.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>  </strong></p><p>
<strong>1. Students must be given all considerations and shall be promoted to the next grade level even if they fail to comply with the necessary academic requirements.</strong>
</p><p>This situation should depend on how much did the student fail. Say, for example, he only failed 3 subjects, summer classes should be enough or additional classes for the next level should be required. But, if the students failed most of the subjects, then he must retain them. So, I disagree that a student should complete not be promoted if he fails the GPA or average.
</p><p>  </p><p><strong>2. Education is the primary key to a better future.</strong>
</p><p>I agree that education is still a key to a better future. Having education gives a person edge for success.
</p><p>  </p><p><strong>3. Quarantines bring more harm than benefits.</strong>
</p><p>Quarantines are necessary to avoid the spread of the virus if and only if the citizens have a safety net. If the government only implements quarantines and does not provide relief goods or aid money to sustain their living or survival, then there will be no harm.
</p><p><strong>4. The government response to the COVID19 Pandemic is appropriate and effective.​</strong>
</p><p>  </p><p>I disagree that the government’s response against the pandemic is appropriate and effective. This is because they are not following the basic protocols or even standards that other countries and the World Health organization have adapted and recommended. An example is that COVID19 Testing should be free and mandatory for easier tracing and isolation. However, they are not doing this. <strong>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Life lessons from… Epicurus</p><p>-Whatever's up there probably isn't all it's cracked up to be. This continues to get Epicurus—and probably this columnist—in hot water. ... </p><p>-Settle for mediocrity. Take on as little responsibility as possible. ... </p><p>-You can have too much of a good thing. ... </p><p>-Avoid politics.</p><p></p><p>Aristotle Ethics</p><p>Aristotle argues that everything has a purpose or goal, and that the purpose is always to attain some good. The “Chief Good” for humanity is that purpose for which all human action is performed. Aristotle believes that the Chief Good for humans is Eudaimonia (often translated as 'happiness').</p><p></p><p>Stoicism Ethics</p><p>Stoicism holds that the key to a good, happy life is the cultivation of an excellent mental state, which the Stoics identified with virtue and being rational. The ideal life is one that is in harmony with Nature, of which we are all part, and an attitude of calm indifference towards external events.</p><p></p><p>2.  abortion</p><p>in my opinion abortion is a great sin, pity the child who was aborted before it was born so it is only right to think carefully before doing something</p><p></p><p>. Euthanasia</p><p>i believe that everyone has the right to live and it is wrong for us to end human life because only god has the right to do so.</p><p></p><p>Suicide</p><p>in believe that it is not right to end one's own life because god gave it so he only has the right to take it back .. even if it is difficult to face the trial we must always believe in him because he will not give us a trial that we cannot pass as long as we always believe to him.it's so nice to live so we just have to make the most of it</p><p></p><p>Death Penalty </p><p>this proves that Crime and evil are rampant so it is only right to have the death penalty to scare bad people into continuing to do evil.</p><p></p><p>4. Utilitarianism is an ethical theory that determines right from wrong by focusing on outcomes. ... Utilitarianism holds that the most ethical choice is the one that will produce the greatest good for the greatest number. It is the only moral framework that can be used to justify military force or war.</p><p></p><p>Kantian ethics refers to a deontological ethical theory developed by German philosopher Immanuel Kant that is based on the notion that: "It is impossible to think of anything at all in the world, or indeed even beyond it, that could be considered good without limitation except a good will." The theory was developed as ...</p><p></p><p>With good reason, Nietzsche's idea of the will to power is considered the focal point of his thinking. ... It allows for exploring the essential features of Nietzsche's philosophical project, and for critically looking into its viability.</p><p></p><p>Pragmatic ethics is a theory of normative philosophical ethics and meta-ethics. Ethical pragmatists such as John Dewey believe that some societies have progressed morally in much the way they have attained progress in science</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>sana makatulong:)</p><p></p><br />
