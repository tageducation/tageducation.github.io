His first job was as a pianist at the Cine Moderno in Quiapo, Manila, where he played musical scores for silent films.</p>TITLE OF THE ART: Noli Me Tangere (1961)El Filibusterismo (1962)Sisa (1951)Banaue: Stairway to the Sky (1975)Dyesebel (1953)Pedro Penduko (1954)American-financed cult horror films in the 1960s, like Terror is a Man (1959)Brides of Blood (1968)Mad Doctor of Blood Island (1969)<p></p>VISUAL ARTS<p><strong>ARTIST: </strong><strong>FERNANDO AMORSOLO</strong>, who is also known as the <strong>Grand Old Man of Philippine Art</strong>. He was raised in Manila, attended the Liceo de Manila Art School and the University of the Philippines School of Fine Arts, and also traveled to Spain and the United States. Amorsolo, who is praised for his aptitude for capturing light and shape, is well known for his paintings of the peaceful rural life of the Philippines. In favor of promoting Filipino beauty, he disregarded Western standards of beauty, and his use of chiaroscuro grew to be recognized as a distinctive artistic technique that distinguished his work from other artists'.</p>TITLE OF THE ART:Maiden in a Stream (1921)The Mestiza (1943)Planting Rice (1946)<p></p>LITERATURE<p><strong>ARTIST: </strong><strong>DR. JOSE RIZAL</strong> is remembered as a great hero and the voice of the Filipino people during colonization by the Spaniards in the late 19th century. He fought for peaceful reforms through his writings while exposing the ills that beset the country. He was a prolific author who penned "Noli Me Tangere" and "El Filibusterismo" to reveal the flaws in Philippine society, abuse by the government, and, on a larger scale, the effects of colonization on people's lives.</p>TITLE OF THE ART:Noli Me Tangere (1887) El Filibusterismo (1891)Mi último adiós (1896)<p></p>MUSIC<p><strong>ARTIST: </strong><strong>LEVI CELERIO</strong>, is a prolific lyricist and composer for decades.

Celerio, a Tondo native, joined the Manila Symphony Orchestra as its newest member thanks to a scholarship he won at the Academy of Music in Manila.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>(1.) Interpersonal communication is the process of exchange of information, ideas and feelings between two or more people through verbal or non-verbal methods. It often includes face-to-face exchange of information, in a form of voice, facial expressions, body language and gestures.</p><p></p><p>(2.) sorry Wala akung ma SAGOT:)</p><p></p><p></p><p>(3.)</p><p>1 -Don't Show Negative Body Language-</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, ‘the first impression is the last impression’, hence you should always be careful when it comes to body language</p><p></p><p>2-Do Not Interrupt the Other Person-</p><p></p><p>It is very rude to interrupt a person while they are speaking. Nobody likes to be interrupted because it hampers the thought process and it is disrespectful.</p><p></p><p>3-Think Before You Speak-</p><p></p><p>Another adage that perfectly describes this point is ‘look before you leap’. You should think how your words are going to affect the person with whom you are communicating before making any comments.</p><p></p><p>(4.)</p><p>1-Problem solving-</p><p>Interpersonal communication skills are necessary because they allow people to discuss problems and weigh the pros and cons of alternatives before coming up with the final solution. </p><p></p><p>2-Alignment with business goals-</p><p>Poor communication between employers and employees can harm the business in many ways. When managers and leaders are unable to clearly communicate tasks, workers can quickly become frustrated and disconnected with the business goals. </p><p></p><p>3-Trust-</p><p>According to the American Psychological Association, a quarter of employees in the US do not trust their employers, and only about 50% of them believe that their bosses are open with them. </p><p></p><p>4-Change management-</p><p>Good interpersonal communication is very important during change management efforts within organizations. </p><p></p><p>5-Company culture-</p><p>Interpersonal relationships, especially when executed well, are important for an organizational culture to thrive. When employees possess good interpersonal communication skills, organizational culture becomes more synergic and positive. With bad interpersonal relationships, on the other hand, negativity, confusion, and conflicts become inevitable.</p><p></p><p>HOPE IT HELPS!!</p><br />

                        <p>Search terms are what cause search engines to produce relevant results. Therefore, we must consider the appropriate search terms to use if we wish to conduct a proper search. We can be very particular with our search terms, but we shouldn't go so far as to type everything into the search field because occasionally the search engine doesn't know what we're looking for, which results in other results or no results at all. For example, we are looking for papers on the internet about machine learning and tomato. We can try "tomato machine learning" or change the word but it must still be related to what we won't find; "tomato fruit detection", "tomato neural networks", and "tomato deep learning" are some of the search terms we can do.</p><br />

He is most commonly known for his Cubist paintings, prints and illustration. He was a member of the Thirteen Moderns, which was led by Victorio Edades. As a neo-realist, he became one of the few artists who were responsible for the modernist movement in the country. Primarily, his work was focused on the issues and the problems of the world. Along with this, the Second World War had a great impact on his paintings. National culture, social environment, identity and native sensibility became the epicenter of his works. Along with this, he also worked on some abstract pieces but his main focus remained on using art as a social commentary. Manansala held his first solo exhibition in the year 1951 at the Manila Hotel. His work had an immense influence on the next generation of painters which included Manuel Baldemor and Angelito Antonio. The Honolulu Museum of Art, the Lopez Memorial Museum, Manila and the Philippine Center in New York hold some of his most famous works. He was posthumously awarded the Order of National Artists of the Philippines in Visual Arts (Painting) in the year 1981.</p><p></p><p>Masterpiece:- Madonna of the Slums (1950)</p><p></p><p>Madonna of the Slums (1950)</p><p>Madonna of the Slums (1950) – Vicente Manansala</p><p>Other Famous Works:-</p><p></p><p>The Bird Seller (1976)</p><p></p><p>Jeepneys (1951)</p><p></p><p>#4 BENEDICTO CABRERA</p><p>Benedicto Cabrera</p><p>Benedicto Cabrera</p><p>Born: April 10, 1942</p><p></p><p>Benedicto Reyes Cabrera, is regarded as the bestselling painter of his generation of Filipino artists. He was introduced to art by his elder brother Salvador, who was also an established painter. While studying at the University of Philippines, he explored various forms of art which included printmaking and photography. He eventually established his own unique form of painting. Cabrera’s work is essentially figurative and he uses fabrics and patterns to bring to life the figures in his paintings. His work is majorly focused on women, but sometimes also depicts men. In the year 1963, he won the first prize in a student competition for one of his oil painting which is known as the talipapa or a market. His first exhibition of paintings was held in Mabini in the year 1965. After that, he has had exhibitions in New York, London, Paris and in various other cities. Cabrera was awarded the Order of National Artists of the Philippines in Visual Arts (Painting) in the year 2006. He is perhaps the most famous living artist in the Philippines.</p><p></p><p>Masterpiece: Sabel in Blue (1969)</p><p></p><p>Sabel in Blue (1969)</p><p>Sabel in Blue (1969) – Benedicto Cabrera</p><p>Other Famous Works:-</p><p></p><p>Edo Gesture (1981)</p><p></p><p>The Oriental Fan (1982)</p><p></p><p></p><p> </p><p>#3 GUILLERMO TOLENTINO</p><p>Guillermo Tolentino</p><p>Guillermo Tolentino</p><p>Lifespan: July 24, 1890 – July 12, 1976</p><p></p><p>Guillermo Estrella Tolentino, is most famous for his work The Bonifacio Monument, which became the symbol of the freedom struggle of the Philippines.

                            30. In your own words, what is the difference between an author and a writer? Kindly explain it, 200 words.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The terms “writer” and “author” tend to be used interchangeably. Even experienced writers and published authors may not know the difference between the two. Though the difference between a writer and an author is subtle, it’s an important distinction for anyone from freelance writers to New York Times bestselling authors to understand.Simply put, a writer is a person who engages in the process of writing. If you spend your days writing books, novellas, or short stories—you are a writer. If your writing routine consists of waking up in the morning and jotting down an entry in your journal or outlining your next story—you are a writer. A writer doesn’t even have to write their own original ideas; if you’re a journalist, ghostwriter, blogger, or screenwriter, the subject matter and central idea of your piece of writing may come from someone else—but you’re still a writer. Anyone who engages in the writing process, regardless of whether or not their work is published, is technically a writer.</p><p>An author is someone whose written work has been published. In addition to producing published work, people who write are considered authors when they originate the ideas and content of their written work. For this reason, most authors are writers, but not all writers are considered to be authors.It might seem that the difference between a writer and author has something to do with the amount of time you spend writing, whether you’re a nonfiction or fiction writer, or whether you give yourself a pen name. This is not the case. The primary difference between a writer and an author has to do with whether or not your work is published.</p><p></p><p>If you’ve written dozens of science fiction novels, children’s books, and various literary pieces—but none of them have ever been published—you are technically a writer. However, if your next book is distributed by the publishing industry, that act of publishing makes you an author. In the era of self-publishing, it’s easier than ever to be considered an author without ever having to interact with traditional publishing companies.</p><br />
