provided.
____1. Last year’s used Christmas light is not functioning because one of the bulbs is busted.
Which of the following discusses the disadvantage shown in the used Christmas light?
A. In a series circuit, the electricity will not flow to the wires when one of the bulb is busted.
B. In a parallel circuit, we can use the other bulbs even one is busted.
C. In a parallel circuit, the electricity will flow in an alternative way.
C. In a series circuit, same electricity will flow in the wires.
___2. Your group went home late at night after class because you need to finalize your project in
Science about series and parallel circuit. You have noticed the lights in the corridor are
switched off and decided to switch on the lights. You noticed that all of the bulbs in the corridor
lighted up with just one switch. Which can be the best explanation to this?
A. The connection is a parallel circuit because it functions even if there is one bulb that is not
 functioning
B .The connection is a series circuit because the bulbs are connected and turned on at the
same time
C. The connection is a series circuit because the light will not open if one is not functioning
D. The connection is a parallel circuit because the system is not affected.
___3. You have presented your project about series circuit on class and had a simple demonstration
on it. You have removed one bulb and the other bulbs didn’t light. What might be the best
explanation to this?
A. The other bulbs are busted. C. There is no power supply.
B. The switch is broken. D. The energy can’t flow because the line is
 Broken.
___4. Which of the following best explains why parallel circuit is best to use in wirings of houses,
buildings and other establishments?
A. The appliances are connected, thus if one will not function also the other will not function
B. It is economical since not all devices will be used at the same time.
C. There is even distribution of electricity to all parts of the system
D. It is expensive because of additional length of the wires
__5. In your brainstorming for making of project in circuit, which of the following is the benefit of using
parallel circuit?
A. When one bulb in the circuit is not working, the flow of electric current stops. Thus, the
 other bulbs will also not work.
B. If this kind of circuit is used, bulbs are permitted to function even when one of them
 stops working.
C. If this kind of circuit is used, bulbs can be switched off by turning off everything.
D. Same amount of electric current passes through each light bulb.</a>

provided.
____1. Last year’s used Christmas light is not functioning because one of the bulbs is busted.
Which of the following discusses the disadvantage shown in the used Christmas light?
A. In a series circuit, the electricity will not flow to the wires when one of the bulb is busted.
B. In a parallel circuit, we can use the other bulbs even one is busted.
C. In a parallel circuit, the electricity will flow in an alternative way.
C. In a series circuit, same electricity will flow in the wires.
___2. Your group went home late at night after class because you need to finalize your project in
Science about series and parallel circuit. You have noticed the lights in the corridor are
switched off and decided to switch on the lights. You noticed that all of the bulbs in the corridor
lighted up with just one switch. Which can be the best explanation to this?
A. The connection is a parallel circuit because it functions even if there is one bulb that is not
 functioning
B .The connection is a series circuit because the bulbs are connected and turned on at the
same time
C. The connection is a series circuit because the light will not open if one is not functioning
D. The connection is a parallel circuit because the system is not affected.
___3. You have presented your project about series circuit on class and had a simple demonstration

B. It is economical since not all devices will be used at the same time.
C. There is even distribution of electricity to all parts of the system
D. It is expensive because of additional length of the wires
__5. In your brainstorming for making of project in circuit, which of the following is the benefit of using
parallel circuit?
A. When one bulb in the circuit is not working, the flow of electric current stops. Thus, the
 other bulbs will also not work.
B. If this kind of circuit is used, bulbs are permitted to function even when one of them
 stops working.
C. If this kind of circuit is used, bulbs can be switched off by turning off everything.
D. Same amount of electric current passes through each light bulb.</h2><br />
