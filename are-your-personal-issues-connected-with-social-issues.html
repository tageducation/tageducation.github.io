                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>A social issue is a problem that influences many citizens within a society. It is a group of common problem in present-day society and one that many people strive to solve. It is often the consequence of factors extending beyond an individual's control. Social issues are the source of a conflicting opinion on the grounds of what is perceived as morally correct or incorrect personal life or interpersonal social life decisions. Social issues are distinguished from economic issues; however, some issues (such as immigration) have both social and economic aspects. There are also issues that do not fall into either category, such as warfare.</p><p></p><p>Personal issues are those that individuals deal with themselves and within a small range of their peers and relationships.[1] On the other hand, social issues involve valuescherished by widespread society.[1] For example, a high unemployment rate that affects millions of people is a social issue.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Pabrainliest please </p><br />

                        <strong>Answer:</strong>Larger social or public issues are those that lie beyond one’s personal control and the range of one’s inner life. These pertain to society’s organizations and processes; further, these are rooted in society rather than in the individual. Nationwide, students come to college as freshmen ill-prepared to understand the rigors of college life. <p></p>Hope it helps!<p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p>A social issue is a problem that influences many citizens within a society. It is a group of common problem in present-day society and one that many people strive to solve. It is often the consequence of factors extending beyond an individual's control. Social issues are the source of a conflicting opinion on the grounds of what is perceived as morally correct or incorrect personal life or interpersonal social life decisions. Social issues are distinguished from economic issues; however, some issues (such as immigration) have both social and economic aspects. There are also issues that do not fall into either category, such as warfare.Personal issues are those that individuals deal with themselves and within a small range of their peers and relationships.[1] On the other hand, social issues involve valuescherished by widespread society.[1] For example, a high unemployment rate that affects millions of people is a social issue.<p></p>Hope this helps<p>- Xin &lt;(￣︶￣)&gt;</p><br />

Our moods, our disposition and even if we are experiencing something. Specially when we saw a story that is similar to what we have at that moment. Our temperament were affected. How we handle the issues also were affected. And most of all the way we addressed the issues are also affected. But the reality is that, we have to remember that what ever happening to other people is not always the same as what we are experiencing. We can think of a better way on how we can handle the situation properly and with dignity. </p><p></p><p>#BRAINLYEVERYDAY</p><br />

For example, one's mental health can be affected by the level of inequality and poverty in society, and one's career choices can impact the overall state of the economy and job market.These issues may require decisions to be made on an individual level, such as seeking help for mental health issues or choosing a career path.

For example, a social problem like unemployment can lead to great personal problems - like financial troubles - for the unemployed individuals, and a personal problem, such as other difficultines, can lead to social problems like mass deaths and the fear that spreads to the whole of society.</p><p>Examples of personal problems (problems that originate within the person or his/her situation) include relationship issues, health troubles, phobias, inability to make friends, loneliness, anger etc. Some examples of social problems (problems that originate within society and affect society as a whole or large numbers of individuals because they are members of society) include poverty,unemployment, unhappy neighbors and so on</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>A social issue is a problem that influences many citizens within a society. It is a group of common problem in present-day society and one that many people strive to solve. It is often the consequence of factors extending beyond an individual's control. Social issues are the source of a conflicting opinion on the grounds of what is perceived as morally correct or incorrect personal life or interpersonal social life decisions. Social issues are distinguished from economic issues; however, some issues (such as immigration) have both social and economic aspects. There are also issues that do not fall into either category, such as warfare.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>A social issue is a problem that influences many citizens within a society.
