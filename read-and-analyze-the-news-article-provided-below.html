                                            People stand in a long queue during the distribution of humanitarian aid near a damaged store of wholesaler Metro in the course of the Ukraine-Russia conflict in the besieged southern port city of Mariupol, Ukraine March 24, 2022. REUTERS/AlexandeBRUSSELS/WASHINGTON — The United States plans to accept up to 100,000 Ukrainians fleeing Russia’s invasion and is pledging $1 billion in new humanitarian aid, the Biden administration said on Thursday after a month of bombardments touched off Europe’s fastest-moving refugee crisis since the end of World War Two.The announcement coincided with U.S. President Joe Biden’s meeting with European leaders in Brussels to coordinate the Western response to the crisis.More than 3.5 million people have fled since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, putting a strain on the neighboring European countries receiving them.U.S. lawmakers and advocates have urged Biden to do more to help those seeking refuge in the United States.In the first two weeks of March, seven Ukrainian refugees were resettled in the United States, internal U.S. State Department data seen by Reuters shows.Some Ukrainians have traveled to Mexico to seek U.S. asylum at the southwest border.A senior Biden official said the administration still expected many Ukrainians to choose to remain in Europe close to their home country but added the U.S. commitment to receive more people would relieve some pressure on European nations currently hosting the bulk of refugees fleeing the conflict, which Russia calls a “special military operation.”“We recognize that some number of Ukrainians who have fled may wish to come to the United States temporarily,” the official told reporters on the condition of anonymity.The Biden administration said in a statement it would use “the full range of legal pathways” to bring Ukrainians to the United States, including the U.S. refugee resettlement program, which provides a path to citizenship.As part of the effort, Ukrainians may enter through existing visa avenues and through a relief program known as “humanitarian parole,” which allows people into the country on an emergency basis, the senior administration official said. The Biden administration said it will focus on Ukrainians with family members in the United States.Reuters reported details of the plans earlier this week.‘Lots of questions’Before the crisis erupted in Ukraine, Biden launched the largest U.S. resettlement effort since the Vietnam War by accepting about 80,000 Afghans – many arriving in a mass airlift operation – after U.S. troops left Afghanistan following 20 years of war.In contrast to the Afghan evacuation, however, the 100,000 Ukrainians would not necessarily be allowed into the United States all at once or even within the current fiscal year, which stretches until the end of September, the U.S. official said.About 355,000 Ukrainian immigrants live in the United States, according to data analyzed by the Migration Policy Institute (MPI), a Washington-based think tank.Julia Gelatt, a senior policy analyst with MPI, said that she welcomed the new U.S. commitments, but that “there are lots of questions” about how much, and how quickly, they could help.A Democrat, Biden set a goal to resettle 125,000 refugees this fiscal year, which began last October, a massive jump from former President Donald Trump, a Republican who slashed refugee levels. But amid COVID-19 delays and other challenges, only around 6,500 refugees from around the world have been admitted, far below Biden’s goal.For Ukrainians who have relatives in the United States, the administration will seek to speed up the processing of family-based visas for permanent residency.But placing Ukrainians through these legal pathways risks adding to an already ballooning backlog of hundreds of thousands of unprocessed visa applications, Gelatt said.The humanitarian parole program, another route the administration could use for Ukrainians, does not provide permanent status in the United States, meaning Ukrainians entering that way would face an uncertain future.Source: newsinfo.inquirer.net1.

day by day and delays all transactions and even the provision of education. Some blames
the pandemic for bringing confusion and anger to some who prefer not to identify what is
fake and fact. There are also people who only care of themselves, complaining for what the

In addition, the participating schools must have the written support and consent of parents of students who shall participate in the pilot program. No student shall be "forced to attend the pilot implementation of face-to-face classes," said the Department of Education. Did you know that before the approval, the Philippines and Venezuela are the only two remaining countries in the world where classes are done remotely since the World Health Organization declared a pandemic in March 20207 Personally, I was surprised with this information.

Write your answer on a separate piece of paper.The COVID-19 Pandemic through the Lens of Education in the Philippines: The New NormalBy: Jose Z. Tria (an excerpt)Along with the current spread of COVID-19 pandemic, physical distancing and face masks wearing to public and private schools are compulsory once classes are resumed or started. Governments around the world have issued policies and guidelines to implement physical distancing in order to flatten the pandemic curve (Greenstone &amp; Nigam, 2020; Thunstrom et al., 2020). In addition, wearing of face masks or even personal protective equipment (PPE) as a public health intervention would probably intercept the transmission link and prevent communicable diseases (Huang, 2020). Thus, students, faculty members and non-teaching staff should be required to wear face masks and maintain physical distancing with each other when going to schools. In addition, they will be required to strictly follow hygienic practices, health protocols and other precautionary measures such as contact tracing, foot baths, sanitation and frequent handwashing. One of the challenges of schools is to reduce student-teacher ratio which will lead to problems like lack of classrooms and other physical plants and facilities, lack of teachers and lack of learning materials. Nonetheless, public health is a concern.​</a>

                            4. People stand in a long queue during the distribution of humanitarian aid near a damaged store of wholesaler Metro in the course of the Ukraine-Russia conflict in the besieged southern port city of Mariupol, Ukraine March 24, 2022. REUTERS/AlexandeBRUSSELS/WASHINGTON — The United States plans to accept up to 100,000 Ukrainians fleeing Russia’s invasion and is pledging $1 billion in new humanitarian aid, the Biden administration said on Thursday after a month of bombardments touched off Europe’s fastest-moving refugee crisis since the end of World War Two.The announcement coincided with U.S. President Joe Biden’s meeting with European leaders in Brussels to coordinate the Western response to the crisis.More than 3.5 million people have fled since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, putting a strain on the neighboring European countries receiving them.U.S. lawmakers and advocates have urged Biden to do more to help those seeking refuge in the United States.In the first two weeks of March, seven Ukrainian refugees were resettled in the United States, internal U.S. State Department data seen by Reuters shows.Some Ukrainians have traveled to Mexico to seek U.S. asylum at the southwest border.A senior Biden official said the administration still expected many Ukrainians to choose to remain in Europe close to their home country but added the U.S. commitment to receive more people would relieve some pressure on European nations currently hosting the bulk of refugees fleeing the conflict, which Russia calls a “special military operation.”“We recognize that some number of Ukrainians who have fled may wish to come to the United States temporarily,” the official told reporters on the condition of anonymity.The Biden administration said in a statement it would use “the full range of legal pathways” to bring Ukrainians to the United States, including the U.S. refugee resettlement program, which provides a path to citizenship.As part of the effort, Ukrainians may enter through existing visa avenues and through a relief program known as “humanitarian parole,” which allows people into the country on an emergency basis, the senior administration official said. The Biden administration said it will focus on Ukrainians with family members in the United States.Reuters reported details of the plans earlier this week.‘Lots of questions’Before the crisis erupted in Ukraine, Biden launched the largest U.S. resettlement effort since the Vietnam War by accepting about 80,000 Afghans – many arriving in a mass airlift operation – after U.S. troops left Afghanistan following 20 years of war.In contrast to the Afghan evacuation, however, the 100,000 Ukrainians would not necessarily be allowed into the United States all at once or even within the current fiscal year, which stretches until the end of September, the U.S. official said.About 355,000 Ukrainian immigrants live in the United States, according to data analyzed by the Migration Policy Institute (MPI), a Washington-based think tank.Julia Gelatt, a senior policy analyst with MPI, said that she welcomed the new U.S. commitments, but that “there are lots of questions” about how much, and how quickly, they could help.A Democrat, Biden set a goal to resettle 125,000 refugees this fiscal year, which began last October, a massive jump from former President Donald Trump, a Republican who slashed refugee levels. But amid COVID-19 delays and other challenges, only around 6,500 refugees from around the world have been admitted, far below Biden’s goal.For Ukrainians who have relatives in the United States, the administration will seek to speed up the processing of family-based visas for permanent residency.But placing Ukrainians through these legal pathways risks adding to an already ballooning backlog of hundreds of thousands of unprocessed visa applications, Gelatt said.The humanitarian parole program, another route the administration could use for Ukrainians, does not provide permanent status in the United States, meaning Ukrainians entering that way would face an uncertain future.Source: newsinfo.inquirer.net1.

In addition, the participating schools must have the written support and consent of parents of students who shall participate in the pilot program. No student shall be "forced to attend the pilot implementation of face-to-face classes," said the Department of Education. Did you know that before the approval, the Philippines and Venezuela are the only two remaining countries in the world where classes are done remotely since the World Health Organization declared a pandemic in March 20207 Personally, I was surprised with this information.

Write your answer on a separate piece of paper.The COVID-19 Pandemic through the Lens of Education in the Philippines: The New NormalBy: Jose Z. Tria (an excerpt)Along with the current spread of COVID-19 pandemic, physical distancing and face masks wearing to public and private schools are compulsory once classes are resumed or started. Governments around the world have issued policies and guidelines to implement physical distancing in order to flatten the pandemic curve (Greenstone &amp; Nigam, 2020; Thunstrom et al., 2020). In addition, wearing of face masks or even personal protective equipment (PPE) as a public health intervention would probably intercept the transmission link and prevent communicable diseases (Huang, 2020). Thus, students, faculty members and non-teaching staff should be required to wear face masks and maintain physical distancing with each other when going to schools. In addition, they will be required to strictly follow hygienic practices, health protocols and other precautionary measures such as contact tracing, foot baths, sanitation and frequent handwashing. One of the challenges of schools is to reduce student-teacher ratio which will lead to problems like lack of classrooms and other physical plants and facilities, lack of teachers and lack of learning materials. Nonetheless, public health is a concern.​</h2><br />
