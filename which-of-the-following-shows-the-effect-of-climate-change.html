                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>A. Rising of sea level</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>As we know climate change or global warming makes the ice in the North and South Pole melt that's why rising of sea level shows the effect of Climate change.</p><p></p><p>#AnswerForTrees</p><p>The following shows the effect of climate change.
</p><p></p><p><strong>A.Rising of Sea level. </strong>Melting of Ice land and glaziers due to climate change will rise the level of the sea. The temperature will become warm and can melt the mount of ice therefore the sea level will rise and has been tied to potential of tsunamis and flooding.  
</p><p><strong>B. Deforestation of the forest.</strong> Deforestation means intentionally cutting or removing trees and forest from the land and converting it into commercial area or for personal advantages. It is one of the contributors of climate change. Forest is a natural cleaner of the earth. It has the ability to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Moreover, deforestation changes the reflectivity of the earth's surface thus resulting in the increased absorption of energy from the sun that forms heat and enhancing climate change.  </p><p><strong>C. Coastal erosion in some places. </strong>Climate change will likely bring a heavy rainfall, high waves, high tides, strong winds and storm surges to coastal areas and it can remove or erode  the rock and sediments permanently.  </p><p><strong>D. Siltation of bodies of water.</strong> It is sometimes called water pollution. It is often caused by soil erosion. Due to climate changes, frequent and intense rainfall can increase erosion resulting to the greater amount of sediments flushing to the rivers, lakes and streams. This can also affect the quality of our drinking water resources.  </p><p>

</p>How to protect yourself?  <p>
</p>Avoid prolonged exposure to sunlight. Use a lotion that is high in UV protection.
Drink plenty of water to prevent dehydration,  it will help to maintain the body 3 temperature.
Take a bath at least three times a day to remove body heat.  
Clean your areas. Make sure there are no stagnant water for this is where the mosquito breed.
