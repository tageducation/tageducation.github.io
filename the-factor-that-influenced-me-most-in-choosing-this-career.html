                            5. 1. What are the most important factors that influence the career choices?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>When we think about career choice, several things immediately come to mind – job description, training and education required, career outlook, and salary – but there are a number of other factors that may influence your decisions</p>Most important factors that influence the career choices<p></p><p>In <strong>Career</strong> development, there are numerous hypotheses to consider. You'll see that many of the related ideas handle some of the same concerns as you go through the factors below.</p><p>1. CHILDHOOD FANTASIES</p><p>Fantasies from adolescence. When you grow up, what do you want to be? You may recall being asked this question as a child, and it may have influenced how you thought about occupations at the time, as well as later in life. As programs relating to job choice are established for all ages, including the very young, <strong>career</strong> counseling theories are evolving. Ginzberg proposed a hypothesis that divides life into three stages that are linked to job advancement. Up to the age of 14, the first stage, fantasy, occurs, during which early career ideas are established.</p><p></p><p>2. CULTURE</p><p>An individual's racial and cultural heritage, as well as the culture of their regional area, local community, and extended family, can all have an impact on<strong> career</strong> choices. Our beliefs and expectations in many aspects of our lives, including employment and careers, are typically shaped by our culture. When counseling clients and students, multicultural career counseling has arisen as a specialist specialty that takes these factors into account. We can't trace a culture's prominent qualities to any one person, but understanding our culture's beliefs and expectations might help us better understand how we make career decisions.</p><p></p><p>3. GENDER</p><p>Both men and women have been subjected to gender stereotypes in the workplace. Multiple <strong>career</strong> development theories and methodologies, such as Social Learning and multicultural career counseling, consider gender as an issue. When it comes to job decisions, how we see ourselves as individuals can have an impact on both the opportunities and barriers we see. Gender and career development research is ongoing as men and women's responsibilities in the workplace and higher education change.</p><p></p><p>4. ROLES IN LIFE</p><p>Working is simply one of your many responsibilities, which also include being a student, parent, and child. The Lifespan theory of Super explicitly tackles the reality that we all play several roles in our lives, and that these roles vary throughout time. How we think about ourselves in these professions, the demands they place on us, and the external influences that influence them may have an impact on how we view careers in general and how we make professional decisions for ourselves.</p><p></p><p>5. SKILLS, ABILITIES, AND TALENTS</p><p> Trait-Factor theories, one of the earliest <strong>career</strong> development topics, is being used today to consider your skills, abilities, and talents and how they might fit a given occupation. These theories advocate for the creation of occupational profiles for specific employment, as well as the identification of individual characteristics and the matching of people to occupations based on those differences. Through a formal assessment, you can identify activities that you love and those in which you have a level of competency.</p><p></p><p></p><p>How does career exploration help in finding the right career choice​</p><p>brainly.ph/question/19406587</p><p>#LETSSTUDY</p><br />

                            17. What are the personal factors that influence our career choice?​</h2><br />
                        <strong>Answer:</strong><p>"Love your work, and you'll never work a day in your life," we constantly hear this saying. Contrary to popular belief, this is not synonymous with a dysfunctional work-life balance. Rather than that, while determining which professional path is most suited to your abilities, seek out one that you enjoy—one that piques your curiosity and provides a sense of purpose. Matching your future professional goals to your existing skillset may better align your interests and experience. When evaluating your long-term career path, it's prudent to focus on some aspects and practical considerations that will affect your total job happiness. Maintaining a healthy balance between personality and job position is critical for long-term job satisfaction.</p><strong>Factors to consider when choosing career choice:</strong><p><strong>Various roles in life</strong></p>Each individual has a unique job to play in life. He is a homeowner, a father, a husband, or a wife. And each individual considers himself in these various positions and determines which one is most significant to him or her. And this choice may affect the individual's professional path and attitude toward work.<p><strong>Personality and Interests</strong></p>One of the most critical factors to consider is your personality type and the level of enjoyment you seek from your employment—extroverted individuals like engaging with people and finding fulfillment in jobs require a great deal of social interaction while introverted likes to be alone and be in a small group.<p><strong>Lifestyle</strong></p>It is critical to strike a balance between necessities and wants. Additionally, geography should be considered. If you dislike the hustle and bustle, you should avoid city jobs that require a lengthy commute.<p></p><p><strong>For more related information, you may visit this link:</strong></p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/22968252</p>#BrainlyEveryday<br />

                            22. how does each of the following factors influence or affect your decision in choosing a career? ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Choosing Right Career is So Important For Students</p><p></p><p>Career Planning is no more a one-time occurrence that would end with the decision of the right university or college. It extends until we get the right job and get a satisfying work profile.</p><p>After completion of schooling, one tends to select a stream based on their previous best performance. If a student scores 90 percentile in Science he/she wants to become an engineer/ doctor and likewise they go for commerce and every other subject. In more than 90% of the cases, it turns out to be haste or a wrong decision. The basis on which we evaluate our career choice remains unjustified.</p><p>Students who face exam anxiety and fail to perform up to their standard in the classroom tests are left out in the race. They are treated as a non-performer or a below-average student. Similarly, there are few who manage to excel just by rote learning. Some depend on their families to make the right call; well, some choose to follow the crowd. There is no clarity of one’s self-interest. This is the first wrong step that can lead them to the wrong path.</p><p></p><p>Make your Career choice Wisely</p><p></p><p>A wrong career choice can also increase the investment cost of a student in his/her education. Every time when a student’s career vision oscillates it calls for unnecessary expenditure. Most of the students invest huge amount of money as well as time in getting clarity over their career choice. They keep changing their subjects, even after having done majors in a particular subject they end up choosing a totally different profession.</p><p></p><p>Find the Best Career For You</p><p></p><p>What is most important is to have a good and clear career choice at an early stage so that it allows one to excel and achieve better in the chosen profession.</p><p>Brig. S. N. Setia, the Director of the ICT who has been associated with the Manav Rachna International University (MRIU) for long , has carved out 7 most common factors that influence the career choice of a student, which often swerves them from making the correct choice.</p><p></p><br />

                        <strong>Answer:</strong>Successful Career Planning<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>WHAT IS A CAREER?<p></p><p>A career can be defined as a person's progress within an occupation or series of occupations. However, a career is more than just a job, or working, or your occupation. It also includes your progress through life, your growth and development in vocational and avocational areas of life.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>Many of us think that there is only one occupation that is best suited for us, but there are really several that may be good choices. The secret is to identify those occupations in which you have a high probability for success and happiness. As a college student, whether your career goals are accounting, theatre arts, or environmental sciences, there are general skills which will be required regardless of the career you pursue. These skills include the ability to read, write, compute, think critically, and communicate in an effective manner. For the most part, these skills are developed and/or sharpened in general education courses. These skills, along with effective career planning techniques, and the ability to cope with ambiguity in a changing environment, will enable you to overcome obstacles throughout your work life.<p></p><p>I'm sorry if my answer is to long☺️</p><br />
