                                            1. Data is an information recorded and used for the purpose of analysis. It is quantitative or qualitative information. a. Quantitative refers to numerical information obtained from measuring or counting. Examples: age, test scores, amount of money, height, weight b. Qualitative refers to descriptive attributes that cannot be subjected to mathematical operations. Examples: blood type, hair color, ethnic group, educational attainment, religion 2. Population refers to the totality of all elements or persons for which one has an interest at a time. For example, the students of Grade 8 - Euclid, the graduating class, the female students at Rosario National High School. 3. Sample is a part of a population determined by sampling procedures. There are four types: a. In a Random sample, each member of the population has an equally likely chance of being selected. The members of the sample are chosen independently of each other. Example: At a party, teams for a game are chosen by putting everyone's name into a container, and then choosing the names (without looking) random for each team. b. A Convenience sample is a sample that is chosen so that it will be easy for the researcher. Example: An interviewer conducts a survey at Robinson's Mall early in the morning on a given day.​</a>

If a population has an equal number of males and females in it, so does the sample. 2. If we wish to draw a sample of 50 individuals from a population of 1000 patients admitted in a certain hospital, we could place the 1000 names in a container and blindfolded, draw one name at a time. 3. The Grade 11 student who happens to be taking a STEM course in the Senior High School and is therefore a convenient subject to use, frequently becomes part of the sample in a research. The students in a class may constitute the entire sample because they happen to be in a class whose teacher is interested in doing a research. 4. A school has 900 students of which 380 are males and 520 are females. A sample of 120 students are needed. To obtain a sample proportional given members in each stratum, and finding the proportion of the samples to the population which is equal to the desired sample size of 120 students. 5. In a population of 200, we wish to get a sample of 40. We obtain n by dividing 200 by 40 to obtain n=5.

                                            Understanding mutually exclusive events or not can be that interesting when geometry is a supplement of learning this topic. We encounter geometry in the previous quarter or other grade levels. We explain things through supporting statements or figures and inject some properties, formulas, postulates, or theorems.This activity will stimulate your logical thinking skills. Study the Venn Diagram then perform a mathematical investigation by following the given stepsStep 1. Based on the Venn diagram, which quadrilaterals have common properties? These properties will become events that lead us to investigate further through the next step.Step 2. Identify pairs of quadrilaterals as events based on the properties common to both or not. Determine whether these pairs illustrates mutually exclusive or not, then state your reason. For example,Pair of Events: “choosing a quadrilateral that is a square and a quadrilateral” Mutually Exclusive or Not: Not mutually exclusive.Reason: The diagram supports that squares are also rectangles, but rectangles are not necessarily squares. It follows that a quadrilateral can be a square and a rectangle at the same timeStep 3. Organize your data in a tabular form.​</a>

A sample of 2,000 was sought to estimate the average achievement in science offifth graders in a city's public schools. The average 5th grade enrollment in the city's elementary schools is 100students. Thus, 20 schools were randomly selected and within each of those schools all fifth graders were tested._________2. A researcher is interested in maximum-security inmates. She groups inmates by thetype of crime committed, determines the percentage of the total in each crime category, and uses that percentageto determine the number of inmates randomly selected from each group._________3. A researcher has a population of 100 third grade children from a local school districtfrom which a sample of 25 children is to be selected. Each child's name is put on a list, and each child isassigned a number from 1 to 100. Then the numbers 1 to 100 are written on separate pieces of paper andshuffled. Finally, the researcher picks 25 slips of paper and the numbers on the paper determine the 25participants.___________4. A sociologist conducts an opinion survey in a major city. Part of the research plancalls for describing and comparing the opinions of four different ethnic groups: African Americans, AsianAmericans, European Americans, and Native Americans. For a total sample of 300, the researcher selects 75participants from each of the four predetermined subgroups.________5. A researcher is interested in political attitudes of individuals within a particularstate. The researcher uses the following procedure to obtain a sample: (a) a random sample of counties is drawn,(b) within the counties selected, districts are randomly drawn, () within each district, blocks are randomlysampled, (d) within blocks selected, building are randomly drawn, and (d) all residents within the buildingsselected comprise the sample._________6. Instructors teaching research methods are interested in knowing what studytechniques their students are utilizing. Rather than assessing all students, the researchers randomly select 10students from each of the sections to comprise their sample.__________7. A researcher is interested in maximum-security inmates. She groups maximum-security prisons by state, randomly selects 10 states, and, from those 10, selects three prisons. She includes allthe inmates in those three prisons in her sample.__________8. Say you wanted to survey professors at KSU about their publication records. Youwant to be sure to include professors from each department, even the very small ones.____________9.

People in the other side. Based on this observation, they believed that the sum travels around the earth. Going directly from observation to conclusion is called non-scientific thinking Here is an example of non-scientific thinking. Maybe you had a sick stomach, and ate a candy bar. An hour later, you observed that you felt much better. You might conclude that it was the candy bar that made you feel better But there are other possible explanations for the observation. Maybe you had taken some medicine an hour earlier, and it took a while to work. Maybe enough time had passed, and you would have felt better without eating the candy bar. Non-scientific thinking happens all the time. The scientific method is a way of thinking that helps you to avoid drawing incorrect conclusions. It helps you to avoid non-scientific thinking. It reminds you to treat your first conclusion as one of several possible conclusions. It reminds you to gather evidence to support your conclusion. The five steps in the scientific method begin by questioning an observation, and end with a conclusion that is based on evidence Step 1 in the scientific method is to ask a question about your observation, such as, "What makes a sick stomach feel better? Step 2 is to state a possible answer to the question, or a hypothesis, such as, "A candy bar makes a sick stomach feel better." Step 3 is to test the hypothesis. This can be done in many different ways. You could wait until you have a sick stomach again, eat a candy bar, and see what happens. You could ask a lot of people if eating a candy bar had ever made a sick stomach feel better. Figuring out how to test a hypothesis is what makes science challenging. Step 4 is to think about the findings—think about what happened when you tested the hypothesis. Step 5 is to draw a conclusion, and share it with the rest of the world. 1. What is this whole story mostly about? A. Going directly from observation to conclusion is called non-scientific thinking. B. The scientific method is a way of thinking that helps you to avoid drawing incorrect conclusions. C. Non-scientific thinking happens all the time. 2. Which of these is a small piece of information from the story that makes the story more interesting? A. People in ancient times believed that the sun travels around the earth. B. People in ancient times knew that the earth was round. C. People in ancient times didn't try to explain the world around them. 3. Which of these is a small piece of information from the story that makes the story more interesting? A. In the example, observation proved that eating a candy bar made a sick stomach feel better. B. In the example, there could be several reasons your sick stomach felt better after you ate a candy. C. In the example, there is only one explanation for why a sick stomach would feel better after you ate a candy bar. 4. Which of these is a small piece of information from the story that makes the story more interesting? A. In the example, you could test your hypothesis by not eating a candy bar the next time you have a sick stomach. B. In the example, you could test your hypothesis by eating a different kind of candy bar the next time you have a sick stomach. C. In the example, you could test your hypothesis by eating a candy bar the next time you have a sick stomach 5. What does non-scientific thinking means? A.

A. No, this is not a thought-provoking question
although the format of the question may
arouse interest, it doesn't really open up good
question. At best, it can lead to a definition of

We explain things through supporting statements or figures and inject some properties, formulas, postulates, or theorems.This activity will stimulate your logical thinking skills. Study the Venn Diagram then perform a mathematical investigation by following the given stepsStep 1. Based on the Venn diagram, which quadrilaterals have common properties? These properties will become events that lead us to investigate further through the next step.Step 2. Identify pairs of quadrilaterals as events based on the properties common to both or not. Determine whether these pairs illustrates mutually exclusive or not, then state your reason. For example,Pair of Events: “choosing a quadrilateral that is a square and a quadrilateral” Mutually Exclusive or Not: Not mutually exclusive.Reason: The diagram supports that squares are also rectangles, but rectangles are not necessarily squares. It follows that a quadrilateral can be a square and a rectangle at the same timeStep 3. Organize your data in a tabular form.​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>where is the question?</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>base on my understanding these are just instruction </p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The prevalence of bullying is hard to ignore. Research indicates between twenty-five and thirty-three percent of children ages twelve to eighteen have experienced some form of bullying. Bullying should never be dismissed as simply ‘kids being kids,’ as it can have significant long-term consequences for victims, leading to loneliness, low self-esteem, depression, and anxiety. Children who are bullied often suffer academically and socially due to the stress caused by bullying. Bullied children may try to avoid the activities where the bullying occurs, leading to decreased school and social participation. If your child is a victim of bullying, there are several steps you can take as a parent to work through the situation with them. Let’s review these steps now!
</p><p>
</p><p>Learn About The Situation
</p><p>  </p><p>Justin Stum, LMFT
</p><p>If you suspect your child is being bullied, first do what you can to understand the situation. Bullying typically happens when adults are not around, or when witnesses who are likely to speak up are not present. Many bullied children may be hesitant to speak up out of fear or embarrassment. It is important to get as many facts as possible, so encourage open and honest communication with your child. Try to learn about the situation from as many sources as possible, including your child, friends, or other trusted adults. Do not rush to judgment until you have had time to learn about the situation.

READING COMPREHENSION TEST (10 items) GRADE 9 - ENGLISH Direction: Read each selection carefully then road and answer tho questions that follow Writo the latter of your answer in your answer shoot DO NOT write anything on the questionnaire The Scientific Method ancient times saw that the sun came up from one side of the earth, moved across the sky, and went down on In ancient times people tried to explain the world around them based on what they saw. People in the other side. Based on this observation, they believed that the sum travels around the earth. Going directly from observation to conclusion is called non-scientific thinking Here is an example of non-scientific thinking. Maybe you had a sick stomach, and ate a candy bar. An hour later, you observed that you felt much better. You might conclude that it was the candy bar that made you feel better But there are other possible explanations for the observation. Maybe you had taken some medicine an hour earlier, and it took a while to work. Maybe enough time had passed, and you would have felt better without eating the candy bar. Non-scientific thinking happens all the time. The scientific method is a way of thinking that helps you to avoid drawing incorrect conclusions. It helps you to avoid non-scientific thinking. It reminds you to treat your first conclusion as one of several possible conclusions. It reminds you to gather evidence to support your conclusion. The five steps in the scientific method begin by questioning an observation, and end with a conclusion that is based on evidence Step 1 in the scientific method is to ask a question about your observation, such as, "What makes a sick stomach feel better? Step 2 is to state a possible answer to the question, or a hypothesis, such as, "A candy bar makes a sick stomach feel better." Step 3 is to test the hypothesis. This can be done in many different ways. You could wait until you have a sick stomach again, eat a candy bar, and see what happens. You could ask a lot of people if eating a candy bar had ever made a sick stomach feel better. Figuring out how to test a hypothesis is what makes science challenging. Step 4 is to think about the findings—think about what happened when you tested the hypothesis. Step 5 is to draw a conclusion, and share it with the rest of the world. 1. What is this whole story mostly about? A. Going directly from observation to conclusion is called non-scientific thinking. B. The scientific method is a way of thinking that helps you to avoid drawing incorrect conclusions. C. Non-scientific thinking happens all the time. 2. Which of these is a small piece of information from the story that makes the story more interesting? A. People in ancient times believed that the sun travels around the earth. B. People in ancient times knew that the earth was round. C. People in ancient times didn't try to explain the world around them. 3. Which of these is a small piece of information from the story that makes the story more interesting? A. In the example, observation proved that eating a candy bar made a sick stomach feel better. B. In the example, there could be several reasons your sick stomach felt better after you ate a candy. C. In the example, there is only one explanation for why a sick stomach would feel better after you ate a candy bar. 4.
