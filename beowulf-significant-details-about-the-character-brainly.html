                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>The dragon is a mighty and glamorous opponent, an appropriate match for Beowulf. The dragon is so well suited to bring about Beowulf’s downfall, in fact, that some readers have seen it as a symbolic representation of death itself: the unique, personal end that awaits every person. Hrothgar prepares us to view the dragon in this way when he warns Beowulf that for every warrior an unbeatable foe lies in wait, even if it is only old age. However, the dragon also symbolizes the specific fate that lies in wait for the Geats, and for pagan society generally. The dragon is “driven […] to guard heathen gold, / through age-long vigils, though to little avail” (ll.2275-7). Like Beowulf, the dragon uses its strength to accrue a huge mound of treasure, but in the end all the treasure does is bring about its death. The treasure also brings about Beowulf’s death. Possibly the poem’s Christian narrator sees greed for treasure as a kind of spiritual death, suffered by pagans who value treasure over Heaven. The dragon hoards his treasure in a “barrow,” that is, a grave.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        CHARACTER OF BEOWULF<br />Beowulf, Hrothgar, Grendel, Grendel's mother, the dragon, Unferth, Wealhtheow, and Wiglaf are the principal characters. Hrothgar, king of the Danes, is one of the most essential characters because he encourages Beowulf and attempts to help him become a better man.<br />SIGNIFICANT DETAILS ABOUT THE CHARACTER<br />- Beowulf<br />Beowulf, the protagonist of the epic, is a Geatish hero who battles the monster Grendel, Grendel's mother, and a dragon that breathes fire. Beowulf's boasts and experiences prove him to be the most powerful and skilled fighter in the area. In his youth, he embodies all of the most admirable characteristics of the heroic culture. In his senior years, he proves to be a smart and successful leader.<br />- King Hrothgar<br />The king of Denmark. Until Grendel terrorizes his realm, Hrothgar enjoys military success and affluence. Hrothgar, a wise and elderly monarch, depicts a different style of leadership than the young warrior Beowulf. He serves as a father figure to Beowulf and a role model for the type of monarch Beowulf will become.<br />- Grendel<br />Grendel, a demon descended from Cain, preys on Hrothgar's warriors in Heorot, the king's mead hall. Grendel's vicious and terrible existence is part of God's revenge for Cain's murder of Abel. Therefore he fits perfectly into the worldview of vengeance that dominates the poem.<br />- Mother of Grendel<br />Grendel's mother, an unidentified swamp witch, had fewer human characteristics than her son, although her terrorization of Heorot is motivated by a human desire for vengeance.<br />- The Dragon<br />The dragon, an ancient and strong reptile, protects a treasure cache in a secret mound. The battle between Beowulf and the dragon is the third and last section of the epic.<br />- Protect Sheafson<br />Shield Sheafson, the fabled king of Denmark from whom Hrothgar is descended, is the mythological founder who inaugurates a long series of Danish monarchs and exemplifies the Danish tribe's best virtues of valor and leadership.<br />- Beow<br />The second king is featured in the poem's introductory genealogy of Danish rulers. Beow is the father of Halfdane and the son of Shield Sheafson. Beow is described by the narrator as a gift from God to a nation in need of a leader. He epitomizes the adage that "admired behavior is the way to power among all people".<br />- Halfdane<br />Halfdane succeeded Beow as king of the Danes. He was the father of Hrothgar, Heorogar, Halga and an unknown daughter who wed a Swedish king.<br />- Hrethric<br />Hrethric, the eldest son of Hrothgar, is in line to inherit the Danish crown, but his cousin Hrothulf will prevent him from doing so. Beowulf offers to facilitate the youth's ascension to the throne by housing and advising him in Geatland.<br />- Hrothulf<br />Hrothulf, the nephew of Hrothgar, betrays and usurps his cousin Hrethic, the legitimate successor to the throne of Denmark. Hrothulf's treachery stands in contrast to Beowulf's dedication to Hygelac in aiding his son's ascension to the throne.<br />- Hygd<br />Queen of the Geats; wife of Hygd Hygelac; young, handsome, and intellectual. The comparison between Hygd and Queen Modthryth is made.<br />- Wiglaf<br />Beowulf's youthful kinsman and retainer aid him in the battle against the dragon as the other warriors flee. Wiglaf demonstrates greater adherence to the heroic ethic than any of Beowulf's other retainers, showing his suitability as Beowulf's successor.<br />- Ecgtheow<br />Ecgtheow is the father of Beowulf, the brother-in-law of Hygelac, and Hrothgar's companion. Ecgtheow is deceased when the story begins, but he lives on in his son's remembrances and via the honorable reputation he earned throughout his lifetime.<br />- Breca<br />Beowulf's childhood pal Breca, whom he defeated in a swimming competition. Unferth alludes to the tale of their contest, and Beowulf proceeds to describe it in detail.<br />- Sigemund<br />A legendary Norse figure is renowned for defeating a monster. Beowulf is praised in Sigemund's tale, which also foreshadows Beowulf's meeting with the dragon.<br />- Princess Modthryth<br />A legendary queen who punishes anyone who looks at her improperly. The purpose of sharing Modthryth's narrative is to contrast her ruthlessness with Hygd's compassionate and sensible actions.<br />REPRESENTATION OF THE CHARACTER IN THE PRESENT SOCIETY<br />- BEOWULF: Our national hero, like Jose Rizal.<br />- KING HROTHGAR: King Solomon was renowned for his sageness.<br />- GRENDEL: Something horrible and demonic, such as criminals or murderers.<br />- GRENDEL'S MOTHER: Represent the military strategist. In actuality, a country still in battle represents her as being in a state of war.<br />- WIGLAF: symbolize valor and fidelity; our hospital's physicians exemplified these qualities.<br />- THE DRAGON: The dragon in Beowulf represents avarice. Thus, dragons may be comparable to those who cause us harm<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Beowulf is the main character in the Old English epic poem "Beowulf." He is a warrior of the Geats, a tribe in what is now Sweden, and he travels to the kingdom of the Danes to offer his services as a hero to King Hrothgar. Beowulf is known for his great strength, courage, and honor. In the poem, he defeats the monster Grendel, who has been terrorizing Hrothgar's kingdom, and later defeats Grendel's mother. He also fights and defeats a dragon that has been wreaking havoc in his own kingdom.</p><p></p><p>King Hrothgar is the ruler of the Danes in the "Beowulf" poem. He is a wise and generous king who is deeply grateful to Beowulf for saving his kingdom from Grendel and Grendel's mother. Hrothgar is also known for his wealth and his great hall, Heorot, which is where Grendel attacks.</p><p></p><p>Grendel is a monster who terrorizes Hrothgar's kingdom and is eventually defeated by Beowulf. Grendel is described as being descended from the biblical Cain, who was cursed by God after killing his brother Abel. Grendel is portrayed as being evil and monstrous in the poem.</p><p></p><p>Grendel's mother is a monster who seeks revenge on Beowulf for killing her son, Grendel. She is eventually defeated by Beowulf in a battle underwater.</p><p></p><p>Wiglaf is a warrior who assists Beowulf in his fight against the dragon. He is one of the few warriors who does not desert Beowulf during the battle, and he helps Beowulf kill the dragon.</p><p></p><p>The dragon is a fearsome creature that Beowulf fights and defeats in the final part of the "Beowulf" poem. The dragon has been hoarding a great treasure, and Beowulf's defeat of the dragon allows him to claim the treasure and bring it back to his own kingdom.</p><p></p><p>In present society, the characters of "Beowulf" are often studied in literature and history classes and are seen as representing the values and culture of the Anglo-Saxons. The character of Beowulf, in particular, is often cited as a model of the heroic warrior and is sometimes used as an example of the ideals of honor and courage.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                            29. What does Beowulf reveal about his character?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>In his youth, Beowulf is a great warrior, characterized predominantly by his feats of strength and courage, including his fabled swimming match against Breca. ...

                            30. analyze the characters in the epic beowulf by providing significant information about them and relating them to the present time.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Beowulf is a fictional prince of the Geats of southern Sweden who comes to Denmark to help King Hrothgar rid his fabulous hall, Heorot, of a terrible monster known as Grendel. ... Beowulf tracks her down and kills her, then returns to Heorot, where he receives great honors and gifts before returning home.
</p><p>
</p><p>King Hrothgar
</p><p>
</p><p>Hrothgar enjoys military success and prosperity until Grendel terrorizes his realm. A wise and aged ruler, Hrothgar represents a different kind of leadership from that exhibited by the youthful warrior Beowulf. He is a father figure to Beowulf and a model for the kind of king that Beowulf becomes.
</p><p>
</p><p>Grendel is feared by all in Heorot but Beowulf. A descendant of Cain, Grendel is described as "a creature of darkness, exiled from happiness and accursed of God, the destroyer and devourer of our human kind".
</p><p>
</p><p>Grendel's mother is as fierce as her son and seems even more vindictive. She is determined to get revenge for her son's death, thus exhibiting a strong maternal instinct. She too, is a descendent of Cain, the first murderer mentioned in the Bible. Thus, she is immediately connected with evil.
</p><p>
</p><p>Wiglaf, one of Beowulf's kinsmen and thanes, is the only warrior brave enough to help the hero in his fight against the dragon. In this regard, Wiglaf appears as a reflection of the young Beowulf in the first part of the story—a warrior who is strong, fearless, valiant, and loyal. </p><p><strong>Explanation: I hope its helpful</strong></p><p></p><br />
