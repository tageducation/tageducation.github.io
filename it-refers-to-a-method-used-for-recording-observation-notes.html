Identify the technique used to discover the themes in the data below.
In a study of birth planning in China, Greenhalgh (in Ryan and Bernard, 2003) surveyed 1,011 ever-married women, gathered social and economic histories from 150 families. She conducted in-depth interviews with
present and formal officials (known as cadres), and collected documentary evidence from local newspapers, journals and other sources. Greenhalgh notes that "Because I was largely constrained from asking direct
questions about resistance, the informal record of field notes, interview transcripts, and questionnaire data contains few overt challenges to state policy." Greenhalgh concludes, however, that their conversations with
the researchers, both peasants and cadres made strategic use of silence to protest aspects of the policy they did not like. Cadres, for example were loathe to comment on birth-planning campaigns; peasant women were reluctant to talk about sterilization. These silences form one part of the unofficial record of birth planning in the villages. More explicit protests were registered in informal conversations. From these interactions
emerged a sense of profound distress of villagers forced to choose between a resistance that was politically risky and a compliance that violated the norms of Chinese culture and of practical reason.

The questionnaire is used to collect data in survey research2. An interview sheet is a set of standardized questions, often called items,which follow a fixed scheme to collect individual data about one or morespecific topics3. The interview method of collecting data involves the presentation of oral-verbal stimuli and reply in terms of oral-verbal responses.-4. A person known as the interviewer is the one asking questions in aninterview.5. Face-to-face contact with the other person or persons is called apersonal interview.6. Structured interviews involve the use of a set of predeterminedquestions and highly standardized techniques of recording-7. Unstructured interviews do not follow a system of pre-determinedquestions and standardized techniques of recording information.8. Quantitative interviews are sometimes referred to as survey interviewsbecause they resemble survey-style question-and-answer formats.9. Observation is a way of collecting data through prediction.10. In observation, a researcher has to immerse himself in the settingwhere his respondents are while taking notes and/or recording._11. In a structured observation, data collection is conducted using specificvariables and according to a pre-defined schedule.12. Unstructured observation is conducted in an open and free manner inthe sense that there would be no pre-determined variables or objectives.13. The use of a pretest or posttest or both is crucial in the testing method.14. The testing method could be used in experimental research.-15. The registration method is in accordance to civil code, laws orregulations of each country.​</a>

Identify the technique used to discover the themes in the data below.
In a study of birth planning in China, Greenhalgh (in Ryan and Bernard, 2003) surveyed 1,011 ever-married women, gathered social and economic histories from 150 families. She conducted in-depth interviews with
present and formal officials (known as cadres), and collected documentary evidence from local newspapers, journals and other sources. Greenhalgh notes that "Because I was largely constrained from asking direct
questions about resistance, the informal record of field notes, interview transcripts, and questionnaire data contains few overt challenges to state policy." Greenhalgh concludes, however, that their conversations with
the researchers, both peasants and cadres made strategic use of silence to protest aspects of the policy they did not like. Cadres, for example were loathe to comment on birth-planning campaigns; peasant women were reluctant to talk about sterilization. These silences form one part of the unofficial record of birth planning in the villages. More explicit protests were registered in informal conversations. From these interactions
emerged a sense of profound distress of villagers forced to choose between a resistance that was politically risky and a compliance that violated the norms of Chinese culture and of practical reason.
