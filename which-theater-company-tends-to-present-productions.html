                        <p><strong>Performance company aims to develop both performers and audiences for classical music theater</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>PETA (Philippine Educational Theater Association)
</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p> <strong>PETA</strong> has remained as one of the top theater organizations in the country. In it's almost 50 years in the industry, the company has developed a multitude creative <strong>theater</strong> artists who believe in PETA's vision of empowering a citizenry through theater arts. It has also built a network of partners who value <strong>culture</strong> as medium for change, and believe that theater can be a <strong>tool</strong> for <strong>education</strong>, <strong>social change</strong> and development.
The social conditions and political climate during the <strong>Martial Law</strong> sharpened the people-based theater aesthetics of PETA. It inspired the company to use the power of theater as a means of producing plays for empowerment and development, especially of the most disadvantaged sectors of society/those in the margins.
<strong>PETA</strong> began by asserting the then radical view of creating and performing plays in Filipino. Most of PETA’s plays were staged at the historic <strong>Dulaang Rajah Sulayman,</strong> an open-air theater designed by <strong>National Artist Leandro V. Locsin</strong>. By the 90’s, it boasted of a solid record of some <strong>300 plays written, translated, adapted, published and performed</strong>, which shaped the company’s theater history, enriching it through theater forms and techniques that expressed local, national and universal themes. Among PETA’s earlier plays have been are the following : <strong>Bayaning Huwad, Larawan</strong><strong>May-i, May-i</strong><strong> Hanggang Dito na Lamang </strong><strong> Maraming Salamat</strong><strong> Juan Tamban</strong><strong>Pilipinas Circa 1907</strong><strong>Ang Buhay ni Galileo</strong><strong> Macbeth</strong><strong> Canuplin</strong><strong> Macliing </strong><strong>Minsa’y Isang Gamu-Gamo,</strong><strong> Ang Paglalakbay ni Radya Mangandiri
</strong><p>
</p><p>
</p>From the beginning, Peta’s pro-people bias was well-known[<strong>vague</strong>]. That <strong>philosophy</strong> dictated its choice of materials to produce, as well as its chosen language for performance—Filipino and other Philippine languages. It encouraged the writing of original works as well as translation of world classics, especially those that <strong>reflected</strong> and <strong>resonated</strong> with the social climate of the times.
Using <strong>theater</strong> for education, Peta went all over the country to train theater practitioners from various sectors—students, workers, farmers and fisherfolk, even sex workers and people in areas of conflict. Its members continually immersed themselves in various communities, particularly those oppressed and marginalized.
These resulted in the creation of a nationwide theater network, as well as the writing and production of theater works deeply rooted in the experiences and sensibilities of Filipinos.[5]
PETA transferred to a permanent building as its headquarters in 2005, which is named the PETA Theater Center. Since the move, PETA has produced and performed adaptations of classic foreign plays as well as local and children's theatrical productions. They also began to adopt modern pop music.[3]
A <strong>multi-function hall </strong>on their building’s second floor is dedicated to film director and Filipino national artist Lino Brocka. Before becoming a film director, the young Brocka had worked with PETA as Guidote-Alvarez's assistant, stage actor, and PETA executive director.<p></p><p>For the last 50 years, Peta has remained operational and has continued producing works and training theater practitioners.
</p><p>
</p>Relentless in seeking out new <strong>audiences</strong>, it <strong>vigorously</strong> partnered with schools, parishes and communities all over the country to ensure that it is able to share its rich educational performances to as many <strong>Filipinos</strong> as possible. The company embarked on many exhilarating tours. Its mobile plays included <strong>Tumawag</strong> kay <strong>Libby Manaoag, Si Juan Tamad and Diyablo at ang Limang Milyong Boto, Hans Christian Andersen Must Be a Filipino, Noli at Fili Dekada dos Mil</strong>.Through its inspired leadership and the contribution of its dedicated members and staff, <strong>PETA mastered its triple bottom lines of artistic excellence, relevance and viability while remaining true to its vision of using theater as a tool for education, social change and development.
