It provides an opportunity for the readers to change their opinions on a certain viewpoint. It expresses stories using plot and other literary elements. It lays down facts or processes to inform the readers. Task 5: Passing the Threshold Now that you already know the text types, you will practice recognizing them in this activity. First, write the text type of the selection. Then, write a one to two-sentence explanation of your answer. Write your responses on your answer sheet. 1. Yesterday, unlike my typical quarantine routine, I woke up early. The moment my alarm went off at 8:00am, I jumped out of bed and rushed to the bathroom to shower. Fifteen minutes was all it took for me to bath and dress. I was ready to go. My heart couldn't keep the excitement and joy. Finally, we were allowed to go out. 2 Once upon a time, the world lived as if there was no pause nor end. It was all hustle, grind, and run until everyone was breathless and exhausted from all the work they had to do. Then, life changed when the virus spread. People couldn't go out of their homes. Work and school stopped. Time seemingly slowed like never before. 3 Alcohol-based hand rubs reduce the growth of microorganisms by dissolving the bacteria's cellular membrane. 4 Dr. Mary Grace Dacuma of the UP Pandemic Response Team has released findings from a recent study on how an epidemic happens and what an epidemic wave is. She noted that the COVID-19 epidemic in the Philippines most likely started with an imported case from an infected person or persons who entered the Philippines. The infected person with the virus is likely the index case that spread the virus to others locally. Dacuma pointed out that the index case(s), especially those that did not cause local transmission, does not form part of the epidemic wave. (Manila Bulletin 2020) 5. This virus does not have a nationality, it does not have an agenda or a political affiliation, it exists to spread where, when and how it can. The only thing that can stop it is community and cooperation. This is not a time for blame or division... The future is being written today, let's write it together with all of our hearts and our humanity. (Morgan, J. &amp; Rosemberg, A. 2020)​</a>

                                            Directid Direction: Read the scenario below. You are working as an editor for a national broadsheet. One of the writers from the Opinion section submitted this text, and you are tasked to evaluate it before editing. Evaluate the following text based on the properties written in the table. Rate each property accordingly. I will not allow my child, Brian, to play violent video games. Why? It's because violent video games could make my child more aggressive. And if he will be continuously exposed to this kind of games, he might also imitate what he sees. And I don't want that to happen. There's a tendency that my child would hate other people for no reason at all. Oh my gosh! I just realized that he might not have friends and he might be bullied in school because of this! What a truly frightening thought! What if Brian never marries in the future because he is so anti-social? I might not have grandkids if that happens! Also, I'm not sure about this, but I think playing violent video games will also affect his brain. That's what his doctor told me during our most recent consultation with him. During this consultation, we also found out that Brian has ADHD and so banning him from playing this kind of game is even more important now. The health of my child cannot be compromised because of this! And his social skills must also be honed by playing with others in real life, not through this kind of violent games. Parents whose child plays games like this must watch their child closely to see if these games affect their social and physical behavior. We cannot allow our society to be ruined because of this! It is up to us parents to monitor the behavior of our children and preserve the peace of our community. Therefore, we must say "No" to our kids playing violent video games!

Unfortunately, theexcitement turned into fear when the corona virus diseasethreatened our country in March, 2020, three days after ourfourth quarter test.President Rodrigo Roa Duterte announced that the EnhancedCommunity Quarantine will be implemented throughout Luzonand other neighboring islands from March 17, 2020 to April 30,2020. During this lockdown, it made me sad because I couldn't goto school, I couldn't play with my friends, and I couldn't do thingsI used to do. In buying our commodities, only one member of thefamily was allowed to go out. Health protocols were followed likeobserving social distancing and wearing of face masks and faceshields in public places. The need of washing the hands with soapand water or using hand sanitizers and alcohol should also bedone as often as possible to prevent the transmission of virus.These are just a few of the many changes this pandemic hasbrought to my life and to the lives of many people.I hope and pray that this pandemic will end soon so we can goback to the normal life that we used to have.1. i know the story beacause2. reminds me something of3. i can relate to the writer because​</a>

Yesterday, unlike my typical quarantine routine, I woke up early. The moment my alarm went off at 8:00am, I jumped out of bed and rushed to the bathroom to shower. Fifteen minutes was all it took for me to bath and dress. I was ready to go. My heart couldn't keep the excitement and joy. Finally, we were allowed to go out. 2 Once upon a time, the world lived as if there was no pause nor end. It was all hustle, grind, and run until everyone was breathless and exhausted from all the work they had to do. Then, life changed when the virus spread. People couldn't go out of their homes. Work and school stopped. Time seemingly slowed like never before. 3 Alcohol-based hand rubs reduce the growth of microorganisms by dissolving the bacteria's cellular membrane. 4 Dr. Mary Grace Dacuma of the UP Pandemic Response Team has released findings from a recent study on how an epidemic happens and what an epidemic wave is. She noted that the COVID-19 epidemic in the Philippines most likely started with an imported case from an infected person or persons who entered the Philippines. The infected person with the virus is likely the index case that spread the virus to others locally. Dacuma pointed out that the index case(s), especially those that did not cause local transmission, does not form part of the epidemic wave. (Manila Bulletin 2020) 5. This virus does not have a nationality, it does not have an agenda or a political affiliation, it exists to spread where, when and how it can. The only thing that can stop it is community and cooperation. This is not a time for blame or division... The future is being written today, let's write it together with all of our hearts and our humanity. (Morgan, J. &amp; Rosemberg, A. 2020)​</h2><br />

One of the writers from the Opinion section submitted this text, and you are tasked to evaluate it before editing. Evaluate the following text based on the properties written in the table. Rate each property accordingly. I will not allow my child, Brian, to play violent video games. Why? It's because violent video games could make my child more aggressive. And if he will be continuously exposed to this kind of games, he might also imitate what he sees. And I don't want that to happen. There's a tendency that my child would hate other people for no reason at all. Oh my gosh! I just realized that he might not have friends and he might be bullied in school because of this! What a truly frightening thought! What if Brian never marries in the future because he is so anti-social? I might not have grandkids if that happens! Also, I'm not sure about this, but I think playing violent video games will also affect his brain. That's what his doctor told me during our most recent consultation with him. During this consultation, we also found out that Brian has ADHD and so banning him from playing this kind of game is even more important now. The health of my child cannot be compromised because of this! And his social skills must also be honed by playing with others in real life, not through this kind of violent games. Parents whose child plays games like this must watch their child closely to see if these games affect their social and physical behavior. We cannot allow our society to be ruined because of this! It is up to us parents to monitor the behavior of our children and preserve the peace of our community. Therefore, we must say "No" to our kids playing violent video games!
