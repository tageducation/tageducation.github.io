                                            THE STORY OF THE OTHER NATIVITY  In the Holy Qu’ran’s version, there was no Joseph, nor a star. There was no gold,  or myrrh, or frankincense. Only Jesus and Mary and a palm tree.  There was a story that arrived on Philippine shores at least 356 years before the  arrival of the Spaniards to bring in the initial vestiges of the Christian belief system to the  Filipino people. The story was that of the birth of Iesa, the Islamic name of Jesus, as  described in the Holy Qu’ran. There was no manger. It was a birth with no magnificent star  in the night to lead no three magis, who bore no gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh.  There were no shepherds. There was no Joseph. But there was a tree, a palm tree, and  flowing water.  The story started with Maryam withdrawing, in seclusion from her family, to a place  facing east. There, the angel Jibrael appeared before her in the form of a man. Appalled,  she said that she sought refuge with God. The angel replied he was only a messenger of  God, sent to announce the gift of a righteous Son. But she could not possibly have a son,  she said, since no man had touched her and that she had not been unchaste. The angel  answered that God did this as a sign to mankind, and that this matter was already decreed.  And so, Maryam conceived the Child, and went to a far off place. When the  appointed time came, the pains of childbirth drove her beneath the shade of a date palm  tree, lamenting, “Would that I had died before this, and had been forgotten and out of sight.”  Then a cry from below came—unclear still whether it was the Child or Jibrael—telling  her not to grieve, and that the Lord had provided a stream of water under her. And if she  would just shake the tree, fresh ripe dates would fall upon her. She was told to eat and drink,  and if she would see a human being, she should say that she had vowed a fast unto the Most  Beneficent and not speak to anyone that day.  DIWATA-1  The baseline design of the 50-kilogram micro-satellite is assigned to Tohoku  University while Hokkaido University is tasked with the payload and thermal design.  The payload subsystem includes a high-precision telescope (HPT) with 3-meter  spatial resolution and bands R\G\B\NIR. The HPT will provide surface reflectance data  with its derived products which will be used mostly for damage extent determination during  disasters and calamities. It can also be used for imaging natural and cultural heritage sites.    The second payload is a space-borne multi-spectral imager (SMI) with liquid crystal  tunable filter (LCTF), which has an 80-meter spatial resolution. The LCTF allows for image  capture to be taken at 10 nanometer increments from 420nm – 650nm for the visible range  and 700nm – 1050nm for the near infrared region. Space products derived from this payload  can be used to determine the health and composition of the ocean, identify distribution and  magnitude of harmful algal blooms, and monitor coastal ecosystems.  With a spatial resolution of 7 kilometers, the wide field camera can used to complement  current weather forecasting capabilities. This sensor can potentially image cloud formations  and typhoons. Other subsystems included are command and data handling, attitude  determination and control, telemetry tracking and command, and power supply system.

                                            EXERCISES 2: Multiple Choice: Circle the letter of the correct answer.Any sample of matter has mass and takes up space. The main reason for this is because:b) Matter can be a gasAll matter is heavyd) The Earth is made of matterc) Matter is made up of tiny particles that have mass and take up space2. Water drops stay together on wax paper and they don't break apart easily. This is mainly because:a) Water molecules are smallb) Water molecules are in motionc) Water molecules are attracted to each otherd) Water molecules are wet3. you put food coloring in room temperature water, the coloring spreads throughout the water.The water causes the color to spread mainly because:a) Watermolecules are warmb) Water molecules are in motionc) Water is denser than food coloringd) Food coloring molecules are small4. Food coloring spreads out faster in hot water than in cold water. This is mainly because:The water molecules in hot water move more quickly b) The molecules in hot water are largerThe food coloring molecules are smalld) Hot water is less dense5. To describe a liquid, you could say:The partides of a liquid are attracted to one another b) The particles of a liquid are in motionThe partides of a liquid are able to move past one another d) A liquid has mass and takes up spaceTo describe a solid, you could say:y the particles of a solidare attracted to each otherb) The particles of a solid can move past one anotherc) The partides of a solid vibrate but do not move past one another d) A solid has mass and takes up space7. To describe a gas, you could say:8). The particles are very attracted to each otherb) The particles are not very attracted to each otherThe partides are dose together like a liquiddi The particles of a gas are further apart than the particles in a liquid or solid8. All of the following are phases (states) of matter EXCEPT:BliquidD putty9. This matter has a fixed shape and volume with particles closely packed together with little movement. It is a:AliquidB solidD plasma10. Capillary action of a liquid is due to?3. vapor pressureb. viscosityc. surface tensiond. pressure11.

                            4. THE STORY OF THE OTHER NATIVITY  In the Holy Qu’ran’s version, there was no Joseph, nor a star. There was no gold,  or myrrh, or frankincense. Only Jesus and Mary and a palm tree.  There was a story that arrived on Philippine shores at least 356 years before the  arrival of the Spaniards to bring in the initial vestiges of the Christian belief system to the  Filipino people. The story was that of the birth of Iesa, the Islamic name of Jesus, as  described in the Holy Qu’ran. There was no manger. It was a birth with no magnificent star  in the night to lead no three magis, who bore no gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh.  There were no shepherds. There was no Joseph. But there was a tree, a palm tree, and  flowing water.  The story started with Maryam withdrawing, in seclusion from her family, to a place  facing east. There, the angel Jibrael appeared before her in the form of a man. Appalled,  she said that she sought refuge with God. The angel replied he was only a messenger of  God, sent to announce the gift of a righteous Son. But she could not possibly have a son,  she said, since no man had touched her and that she had not been unchaste. The angel  answered that God did this as a sign to mankind, and that this matter was already decreed.  And so, Maryam conceived the Child, and went to a far off place. When the  appointed time came, the pains of childbirth drove her beneath the shade of a date palm  tree, lamenting, “Would that I had died before this, and had been forgotten and out of sight.”  Then a cry from below came—unclear still whether it was the Child or Jibrael—telling  her not to grieve, and that the Lord had provided a stream of water under her. And if she  would just shake the tree, fresh ripe dates would fall upon her. She was told to eat and drink,  and if she would see a human being, she should say that she had vowed a fast unto the Most  Beneficent and not speak to anyone that day.  DIWATA-1  The baseline design of the 50-kilogram micro-satellite is assigned to Tohoku  University while Hokkaido University is tasked with the payload and thermal design.  The payload subsystem includes a high-precision telescope (HPT) with 3-meter  spatial resolution and bands R\G\B\NIR. The HPT will provide surface reflectance data  with its derived products which will be used mostly for damage extent determination during  disasters and calamities. It can also be used for imaging natural and cultural heritage sites.    The second payload is a space-borne multi-spectral imager (SMI) with liquid crystal  tunable filter (LCTF), which has an 80-meter spatial resolution. The LCTF allows for image  capture to be taken at 10 nanometer increments from 420nm – 650nm for the visible range  and 700nm – 1050nm for the near infrared region. Space products derived from this payload  can be used to determine the health and composition of the ocean, identify distribution and  magnitude of harmful algal blooms, and monitor coastal ecosystems.  With a spatial resolution of 7 kilometers, the wide field camera can used to complement  current weather forecasting capabilities. This sensor can potentially image cloud formations  and typhoons. Other subsystems included are command and data handling, attitude  determination and control, telemetry tracking and command, and power supply system.
