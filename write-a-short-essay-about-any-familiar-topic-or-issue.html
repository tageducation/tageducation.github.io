                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Should Public Workers be Allowed to Strike?</p><p></p><p>Say goodbye to ‘stress at work’ and welcome the ‘freedom to express yourself’. Most public workers are denied their right of expression even after being exposed to bad working conditions and rights violations.Thus, these violations deny them the morale for performing well on their duties. As such, enabling workers to strike motivates them to work.This is because, it encourages them to speak out whenever they feel their rights, safety, and/or regulations have been compromised. As such, countries across the globe should always allow public workers to strike.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>My Family:</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, “Family is the best thing you could ever wish for. They are there for you during the ups and downs and love you no matter what”.</p><p></p><p>Contrary to this saying, we cannot choose our family as we choose our friends. But I can say that I’m blessed with a wonderful family. My family is very small with four members – my mother, my father, my elder sister and me. My family is a middle class family and my father is officially the bread winner of our family. My mother supports him financially by taking tuitions for school children.</p><p></p><p></p><p> </p><p>We do not have much money or wealth but what my family has in abundance is love for each other which cannot be replaced by anything else in this world. My father and my mother are the role models to my sister and me. They struggle a lot to give us a better life. More than anything they have taught us discipline and morals of life which is helping us to lead our lives in a righteous path even today.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Our generation is living amidst what can be called as one of the greatest threats in our lifetime to global education. To persevere through this pandemic and persistently educate the coming few generations were treated as a priority at one point in the twelve months of quarantine we have been experiencing. This is how online learning was implemented, although regardless of how effective it may be, our first concern should be its affordability. Jobs and shops have been forced to shut down and it has hit a big impact on the mass' financial statuses, many of which still have children and teens to send to school. The government enforced online classes but failed to see that its price would not make it available to everyone. To pursue education is challenging enough, what more when quality education is the one you need. Although proven to be ineffective to many students, I believe in terms of persevering education despite the pandemic that this is the best method for us to have come up with. Online classes gives way to students that want to persevere through these hard times. Regardless of its effectiveness, the other huge problem about this is its affordability, there have been decrease of tuition fees yet definitely not enough. Not all schools were generous enough to exclude the additional fees that are unnecessary including but not limited to school uniforms, notebooks, and other added school programs.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        COVID-19 Vaccines: Greatest Public Health Accomplishment   After COVID-19 was declared a worldwide pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020, life as we knew it altered dramatically and millions went into lockdown. Since then, most of the world has had to contend with masks, distancing, ventilation and cycles of lockdowns as surges flare up. Deaths from COVID-19 infection, along with economic and mental health effects from the shutdowns, have been devastating. The need for an ultimate solution -- safe and effective vaccines -- has been paramount.     I enthusiastically support the vaccination against COVID for children aged 5-11 years old. I have seen the immediate and long-term consequences of COVID-19 on patients – and on their families. I have lived through the fear and anxiety of from the scourges of the pandemic and worried constantly about bringing the virus home.
     It is imperative that we vaccinate as many children in the community as possible. There are several reasons why. First children do get sick from COVID-19. Over the course of the pandemic in the Philippines, more than 2 million children aged 5-11 have become infected, more than 8000 have been hospitalized, and more than 100 have died, making COVID one of the top 10 causes of pediatric deaths in this age group over the past year. Children are also susceptible to chronic consequences of COVID such as long COVID and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). Most studies demonstrate that 10-30% of children will develop chronic symptoms following COVID-19. These include complaints of brain fog, fatigue, trouble breathing, fever, headache, muscle and joint pains, abdominal pain, mood swings and even psychiatric disorders. Symptoms typically last from 4-8 weeks in children, with some reporting symptoms that persist for many months.
     Vaccines are one of the greatest public health accomplishments of all time. For centuries, public health has relied on vaccinations to prevent and control disease outbreaks for a plethora of infectious scourges, with our crowning achievement being the successful eradication of smallpox.
    The purpose of vaccine documentation is to provide proof of an individual's protection from either becoming infected or transmitting a vaccine-preventable disease. Vouching for these protections requires a firm knowledge about the epidemiology of the disease, as well as scientific knowledge concerning the efficacy of the vaccine. The vaccines we currently require be documented have met these tests; the vaccine for COVID-19 has not yet been proven to do so.<strong>[Source: https://leaps.org/want-to-motivate-vaccinations-focus-on-the-reasons-for-optimism-not-continual-doom/]</strong><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>One topic that has been on my mind recently is the issue of gun control. In the United States, where I am from, there has been a lot of debate about gun laws and whether they are effective in preventing gun violence. In my opinion, stricter gun control laws are necessary in order to keep communities safe and reduce the number of gun-related deaths.</p><p></p><p>One of the main arguments against stricter gun control laws is that they infringe on the rights of individuals to own guns for self-defense. While I understand this argument, I believe that the right to own a gun for self-defense does not outweigh the right of individuals to live in a safe community. The United States has a high rate of gun violence compared to other developed countries, and I believe that stricter gun control laws would help to reduce this violence.</p><p></p><p>Another argument against stricter gun control laws is that they would not be effective in preventing gun violence. However, research has shown that countries with stricter gun control laws tend to have lower rates of gun violence. For example, Australia implemented strict gun control laws following a mass shooting in 1996, and the country has not had a mass shooting since. This is evidence that stricter gun control laws can be effective in reducing gun violence.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, I believe that stricter gun control laws are necessary in order to keep communities safe and reduce the number of gun-related deaths. While there are arguments against stricter gun control laws, I believe that the benefits of such laws outweigh the potential drawbacks.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Essay Critique Guidelines</p><p>Contents</p><p>Further Directions for Specific Assignments</p><p>Personal Essay Critique:</p><p>Show all 10 ...</p><p></p><p>Study English at Goshen College.</p><p>Whenever you read an essay, use the following questions to guide your response.</p><p></p><p>First, keep in mind that, although you may not be a writing expert, you are THE reader of this essay and your response is a valid one. I have found that almost every reader, regardless of experience, can identify the primary strength and weakness in an essay, although their method of describing those issues may be different. The author will welcome your response and your ability to explain your reaction in a new way. Although the author is not required to, and really shouldn’t, respond to everything you say, he or she will take your comments seriously and consider how the essays has enlightened or confused you. Therefore, comment freely, although respectfully. Keep in mind that it is better to begin by noting the strengths of the essay before pointing out the areas that need improvement. I would always include a personal response to questions like the following: What about the essay most connects with your experience? Moves you? Provokes you? Entertains you?</p><p></p><p>So that is how to respond. So how do you critique? For every essay, regardless of the mode, consider the broad categories of content, organization, style, and correctness.</p><p></p><p>Content: Consider the topic (its appropriateness and interest for the assignment as well as a clear focus suitable to essay length) and the way the topic is developed (clarity sufficiency of its argument, its scope, subcategories, amount and type of examples, anecdotes, evidence, etc.).</p><p>Organization: Consider how the essay is introduced and concluded (especially looking for a “frame” to the essay, where the intro and conclusion refer to the same idea), whether the thesis is located in the most helpful place (direct or implied), how the essay is structured, whether the order or extent of development is successful, as well as how individual paragraphs are organized (clear topic sentences, appropriate and concrete evidence, logical organization of evidence).</p><p>Style: Style can refer to the overall style of an essay: whether the tone is appropriate (humorous, serious, reflective, satirical, etc.), whether you use sufficient and appropriate variety (factual, analytical, evaluative, reflective), whether you use sufficient creativity. Style can also refer to the style of individual sentences: whether you use a variety of sentences styles and lengths, whether sentences are worded clearly, and whether word choice is interesting and appropriate.</p><p>Correctness: Correctness refers to grammar, punctuation, and form of the essay. You do not need to know the exact grammatical term or rule to know when a sentence is not correct. Even though you may not know the term dangling modifier, you could identify that the following sentence is not correct:</p><p>Rolling around in the bottom of the drawer, Tim found the missing earring. [certainly the earring was rolling, not Tim!]</p><p></p><p>You could also easily tell that the following sentence actually contains two sentences that need punctuation between them:</p><p></p><p>The new manager instituted several new procedures some were impractical. [You need to add punctuation (period) after “procedures” and capitalize “some.”]</p><p></p><p>Feel free to mark the essay at the point of the error with a specific recommendation (“run-on sentence”) or a general comment (“this sentence sounds wrong to me”). You can also simply put an “X” by any sentence that seems incorrect. See the back of WR for commonly used Correction Symbols.</p><br />

                        Police Brutality<p></p><p><strong>During the regime of President Duterte </strong>throughout these years, Police has been so outrageous in their position and they've become irresponsible in their duties. As a citizen of the Philippines, this is not good to hear at all. All of these killings due to Police's irresponsibility and power to avoid<strong> the PHILIPPINE LAW. </strong></p><p><strong>All of the news </strong>as you can see, there's always a police officer that is included in crimes such as gun for hire. One new incident is the death of <strong>the Calbayog City Mayor, </strong>the real thing is the police are the one who made their first move. </p><p>I know <strong>Police Salary </strong>are high but how could they be involve in Gun for hire, is their salary too low for them? President Duterte's relationship towards Philippine Police is kind of babysitting them which is not good; this kind of treatment is inappropriate because <strong>PNP might think </strong>that they'll exempted in crimes they've been involved.</p><p></p><p><strong>Essay is </strong>a prosaic writing that presents subjective-personal ideas about an issue based on the author's personal point of view. In another sense, an essay is writing containing one's opinion or opinion on an actual problem or attracting attention. </p><p><strong>Essay type</strong> writing prioritizes the sharpness of analysis, interpretation, and reflection with in-depth descriptions accompanied by strong arguments.</p><p></p><p>Learn more about essays at https://brainly.ph/question/27553192</p><p>#SPJ5</p><p></p><br />
