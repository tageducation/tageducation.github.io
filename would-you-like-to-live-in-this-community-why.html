                        Yes I do. It is peaceful, quiet, and it is likely that the situation in our community was tranquil. But over time, people are increasingly increasing in numbers and those who do not know you are increasing. If it's quiet every night, it's no longer. There are some traveling and walking walks every night so some homeless people are struggling. It requires extreme caveatings or observations from community officials where it watches overnight.<br />
