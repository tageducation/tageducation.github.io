                                            When was the last time you've watched Maalaala Mo Kaya (MMK)? Perhaps, you were able to watch the episode entitled "Bangka" that talks about the struggle of a young girl who was so motivated to reach her dreams of finishing her studies despite her family's experience of extreme poverty. As a student, she would regularly brace the danger of swimming in an open sea just to arrive at school. I can still remember even today how my heart somehow "felt" the girl's own emotions as she constantly struggled because of her dream, even if that story is never my own and that I do not know her personally. Have you also experienced something similar to this? What was it like? Write your thoughts or feelings about this on the space below:​</a>

Perhaps, you were able to watch the episode entitled "Bangka" that talks about the struggle of a young girl who was so motivated to reach her dreams of finishing her studies despite her family's experience of extreme poverty. As a student, she would regularly brace the danger of swimming in an open sea just to arrive at school. I can still remember even today how my heart somehow "felt" the girl's own emotions as sho constantly struggled because of her dream, even if that story is never my own and that I do not know her personally.

So one bright day, Petros took a bus for the nearest town. He had taken a bus a few times before. But he never enjoyed any of those trips because the bus was to crowded for comfort. He did not mind any discomfort on that day, for he was at last going to Manila, the city of his dreams! Petros had to wait at the station for more than three hours. He had lunch and a short nap when the train finally arrived. How wonderful his trip was! He wondered at the speed it took the train to reach the city. He wondered at the varied things he saw on the way.

Walking on the Moon
When I was in Grade 3, I got to take a trip to the moon. I remember
the day like it was yesterday. It was one of the strangest experiences I’d
ever had.
It all started when Miss Reyes, our Grade 3 Science teacher, was
showing a video about the different planets in the solar system. Halfway
through the video, I noticed a sparkling metal disc, about the size of a peso
18
PIVOT 4A CALABARZON
E
coin, lying on the floor. I kept trying to pay attention to the video, but found
myself bending over to pick up the shiny disk that was next to my desk.
As soon as I touched the metal disk, something strange happened.
I wasn’t in the classroom anymore. I was hovering in the air, way above
the school. I could see the whole or rather the rooftops of the whole city.
I was a little nervous, but also pretty excited. What was happening? How
could I be floating?
It was then when I remembered the metal disk I’d picked up from
the floor earlier. Did it I have something to do with the strange things that
were happening to me right now? I opened my palm and looked closely at
the disk. On the disk were these words:
“Floating through the air, like a helium filled balloon, your travels will
not stop, until you reach the moon”
The next thing I knew, I was soaring through space, dodging
satellites and asteroids. Oddly enough, I wasn’t cold and I was able to
breathe just fine. Before I knew it, I was standing on the moon. It was
amazing! It looked very different from the Earth. No trees, water, nor
houses. There wasn’t even any wind .
For each step I took I would bounce way up into the air. Every step
took left a huge footprint in the dust. I had to be careful and make sure
I didn’t jump into a crater because I wasn’t sure if I’d be able to get
out. Sometimes I couldn’t even see the bottom. I was bounding over to
something in the distance that looked very out of the place. When I got
there, I realized it was a flag. On the flag were the words: “To go to Earth,
close your eyes and think of what you’ve learned. You will find in no time at
all, you will be returned”. I wasn’t sure I wanted to go back just yet, but
I knew it might get dark soon and I didn’t want to be on the moon by
myself in the dark. I decided to close my eyes and think of the weather and
other characteristics of the moon I’d learned that day.
When I opened my eyes I was sitting on my seat in my Science
classroom. Miss Reyes was turning on the lights because the video was
over. I sat there wondering about what just happened. I opened my hand to
look at the metal disk, but it was gone! Did I really take a trip to the moon
or was it just a dream?
1. Where is the setting of the story?
a. Saturn b. outer space c. a town d. a Science classroom
2. In the sentence, “ I was hovering in the air, way above the school” what
does the word hovering mean?

3. Why are the words “Floating through the air, like a helium filled balloon,
your travels will not stop, until you reach the moon” written in italics?
a. The teacher thinks they are important.
b. They are words the student says.
c. They are words from the video.
d. The words on the disk are important.

                                            A DREAM TRIP Petros had lived in the barrio all his life before his uncle's Invitation came. His uncle Juanito wrote him to come to Manila, "I want you to come and help me in my furniture shop," he wrote. "I'm sending you your train fare. Call me when you leave. I'll meet you at the station." So one bright day, Petros took a bus for the nearest town. He had taken a bus a few times before. But he never enjoyed any of those trips because the bus was to crowded for comfort. He did not mind any discomfort on that day, for he was at last going to Manila, the city of his dreams! Petros had to wait at the station for more than three hours. He had lunch and a short nap when the train finally arrived. How wonderful his trip was! He wondered at the speed it took the train to reach the city. He wondered at the varied things he saw on the way. After he had satisfied his thirst foe new things, he told himself, "There's nothing more exciting than leaving one's barrio for the great big city."

Walking on the Moon
When I was in Grade 3, I got to take a trip to the moon. I remember
the day like it was yesterday. It was one of the strangest experiences I’d
ever had.
It all started when Miss Reyes, our Grade 3 Science teacher, was
showing a video about the different planets in the solar system. Halfway
through the video, I noticed a sparkling metal disc, about the size of a peso
18
PIVOT 4A CALABARZON
E
coin, lying on the floor. I kept trying to pay attention to the video, but found
myself bending over to pick up the shiny disk that was next to my desk.
As soon as I touched the metal disk, something strange happened.
I wasn’t in the classroom anymore. I was hovering in the air, way above
the school. I could see the whole or rather the rooftops of the whole city.
I was a little nervous, but also pretty excited. What was happening? How
could I be floating?
It was then when I remembered the metal disk I’d picked up from
the floor earlier. Did it I have something to do with the strange things that
were happening to me right now? I opened my palm and looked closely at
the disk. On the disk were these words:
“Floating through the air, like a helium filled balloon, your travels will
not stop, until you reach the moon”
The next thing I knew, I was soaring through space, dodging
satellites and asteroids. Oddly enough, I wasn’t cold and I was able to
breathe just fine. Before I knew it, I was standing on the moon. It was
amazing! It looked very different from the Earth. No trees, water, nor
houses. There wasn’t even any wind .
For each step I took I would bounce way up into the air. Every step
took left a huge footprint in the dust. I had to be careful and make sure

there, I realized it was a flag. On the flag were the words: “To go to Earth,
close your eyes and think of what you’ve learned. You will find in no time at
all, you will be returned”. I wasn’t sure I wanted to go back just yet, but
I knew it might get dark soon and I didn’t want to be on the moon by
myself in the dark. I decided to close my eyes and think of the weather and
other characteristics of the moon I’d learned that day.
When I opened my eyes I was sitting on my seat in my Science

over. I sat there wondering about what just happened. I opened my hand to
look at the metal disk, but it was gone! Did I really take a trip to the moon

His uncle Juanito wrote him to come to Manila, "I want you to come and help me in my furniture shop," he wrote. "I'm sending you your train fare. Call me when you leave. I'll meet you at the station." So one bright day, Petros took a bus for the nearest town. He had taken a bus a few times before. But he never enjoyed any of those trips because the bus was to crowded for comfort. He did not mind any discomfort on that day, for he was at last going to Manila, the city of his dreams! Petros had to wait at the station for more than three hours. He had lunch and a short nap when the train finally arrived. How wonderful his trip was! He wondered at the speed it took the train to reach the city. He wondered at the varied things he saw on the way. After he had satisfied his thirst foe new things, he told himself, "There's nothing more exciting than leaving one's barrio for the great big city."
