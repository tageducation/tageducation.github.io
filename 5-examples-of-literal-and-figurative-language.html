(2) Everest has fascinated many climbers between 2000 and 2006, 4,886 people attempted the climb. (3) This undertaking can be dangerous, and 38 climbers died (“Everest Expedition Statistics”). (4) While climbing Mount Everest can be dangerous, an understanding of science basics such as altitude, air pressure, and simple machines can help climbers stay safe.            (5)  Everest is at a very high altitude. (6) The word altitude means how far above sea level something is. (7) The higher you go, the less oxygen there is (Platt 26). (8) Because people need oxygen to breathe, they may get altitude sickness as they climb to higher altitudes. (9) “Because of the lack of oxygen,” explains British mountaineer Graham Ratcliffe, “You get nausea and bad headaches and suffer from loss of appetite” (“Double Feat”). (10) These are the most common symptoms of altitude sickness. Source:Prentice Hall Writing Coach. Pearson Education, Inc.,2012,p.243.1.

(2) Everest has fascinated many climbers between 2000 and 2006, 4,886 people attempted the climb. (3) This undertaking can be dangerous, and 38 climbers died (“Everest Expedition Statistics”). (4) While climbing Mount Everest can be dangerous, an understanding of science basics such as altitude, air pressure, and simple machines can help climbers stay safe.            (5)  Everest is at a very high altitude. (6) The word altitude means how far above sea level something is. (7) The higher you go, the less oxygen there is (Platt 26). (8) Because people need oxygen to breathe, they may get altitude sickness as they climb to higher altitudes. (9) “Because of the lack of oxygen,” explains British mountaineer Graham Ratcliffe, “You get nausea and bad headaches and suffer from loss of appetite” (“Double Feat”). (10) These are the most common symptoms of altitude sickness. Source:Prentice Hall Writing Coach. Pearson Education, Inc.,2012,p.243.1.
