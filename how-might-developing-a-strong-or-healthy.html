                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Being physically fit and actively exercising benefits our body through:
</p><p>
</p><p>• Agility. Being agile helps you in moving quickly yet still maintaining control. With this, you can effectively change directions when there are obstacles, which can help prevent injuries.
</p><p>
</p><p>• Balance. Having balance prevents unexpected falls. This helps control the body while doing challenging tasks. It helps you juggling tasks or chores without you falling or your things falling.
</p><p>
</p><p>• Coordination. Having coordination helps you in your movement. Like the coordination of your hands and eyes makes things easier, or coordination of your feet and eyes. Using different parts of your body efficiently makes it more convenient to doing tasks and chores. It helps you overcome obstacles such as leg entangling.
</p><p>
</p><p>• Speed. Of course, this helps reduce the time spent on doing tasks. But alongside speed, each action should be efficient and well-coordinated so that you can maximize your time. Finishing tasks quickly gives you more time to do other things.
</p><p>
</p><p>• Power. Having power is knowing the exact strength and speed you would be exerting to accomplish tasks. It helps you push through doing the job. It’s the force that your muscle could exert for a particular task. It’s the combination of overcoming resistance and how fast you move.  
</p><p>
</p><p>• Reaction Time. This was more related to how quickly your brain can comprehend information and how quickly you respond. It’s somehow part of our reflexes. This has many benefits, such as catching falling objects or helping prevent severe injuries from falling. Sometimes you won’t even have to think anymore, and your body would automatically do something as a reaction to something.  
</p><p>
</p><p>Those are just one of the many you were benefiting from for being physically fit. When you’re strong and healthy, it’ll reduce the risks of injuries while doing tasks or activities. It also helps you in performing duties as efficiently as you can. This reduces the stress not only in your body but on your mind. So, keep moving, exercising, and keeping tabs on your health.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />
