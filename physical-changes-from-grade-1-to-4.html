Procedure 1. Cut and design your shoe box as shown in Figure 2. 2. Put the rubber bands around the box. Make sure that the rubber bands are almost equally spaced and that the rubber bands thickness from the lower end to the other end of the box. Figure 2. My sounding box 3. Use your finger to pluck each rubber band. Source: Science- Grade 7 Listen to the sound produced. Learner's Material First Edition 2017 4. This time use the fingers of one hand to stretch one of the elastics. Pluck the elastic with the fingers of the other hand and obsere. 5. Repeat step 4 with the other elastic bands. 6. Share the picture of your sounding box by sending it through your GC. Guide Questions: 1. What physical signs did you observe when you plucked each band. Did you hear any sound? What produced the sound? 2. How different are the sounds produced by each band with different thickness? 3. Are there changes in the note when you plucked the stretched band? 4. Arrange the elastics in sequence from the highest note to the lowest note produced​</a>

All species need water to live. When it evaporates from the surface of the earth, it rises into clouds, cools and condenses, and falls again as rain or snow in the precipitation process on the surface. It cycles in the atmosphere. Snow in the mountains directly turns into water vapor due to high vapor pressure. Unfortunately, the cycle of water in our environment is disturbed due to human activities. Fossil fuels such as coal, crude oil, and, natural gas when burned, produce ra                   bibigyan ko na excelent star maka sagot thank you pu​</a>

In first grade, for example, it is important to know whether children can successfully manipulate a pencil. In later grades, it is important to know how long students can be expected to sit still without discomfort—a real physical challenge. In all grades, it is important to have a sense of students’ health needs related to their age or maturity, if only to know who may become ill, and with what illness, and to know what physical activities are reasonable and needed.</p><p></p><br />

Activity 2: My Own Sounding Box Materials Needed - shoe bax variety of elastic or rubber bands (thin and thick) extra cardboard - optional CAUTION: pair of scissors or cutter ruler Handle all sharp tools with care. . . Procedure 1. Cut and design your shoe box as shown in Figure 2. 2. Put the rubber bands around the box. Make sure that the rubber bands are almost equally spaced and that the rubber bands thickness from the lower end to the other end of the box. Figure 2. My sounding box 3. Use your finger to pluck each rubber band. Source: Science- Grade 7 Listen to the sound produced. Learner's Material First Edition 2017 4. This time use the fingers of one hand to stretch one of the elastics. Pluck the elastic with the fingers of the other hand and obsere. 5. Repeat step 4 with the other elastic bands. 6. Share the picture of your sounding box by sending it through your GC. Guide Questions: 1. What physical signs did you observe when you plucked each band. Did you hear any sound? What produced the sound? 2. How different are the sounds produced by each band with different thickness? 3. Are there changes in the note when you plucked the stretched band? 4. Arrange the elastics in sequence from the highest note to the lowest note produced​</h2><br />
                        <p>1.The rubber bands Vibrate when plucked and sound could be heard. Sound is produced by vibration of the rubber band.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>1. When the rubber bands were plucked a vibration occurs that produces sound.</p><p>2. Yes, with this, it will be known that vibrations produce sound.</p><p>3. Thicker, heavier, and loosely stretched rubber bands will sound lower pitched, while thinner, lighter, tightly stretched rubber bands will sound higher.</p><p>4. Yes, there are changes in the note when you the stretched band plucked. There are normally two states for a band. One is Normal state, where there is no external tensile force applied on it.</p><p></p><p>HOPE IT HELPS..BRAINLIST PO :)</p><br />
