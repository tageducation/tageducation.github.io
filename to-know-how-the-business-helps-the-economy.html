                                            1. All things can be changed in two ways: chemically and physically. Both chemical and physical changes affect the state of matter. Physical changes are those that do not change the identity of the matter. For instance, clay will bend if squeezed. Still it will be a clay. Change in shape is a physical change. It does not change the matter's identity. Chemical changes turn the matter into a new kind of matter with different properties. For instance, when paper is burnt, it becomes ash. It will never be paper again. The difference between them is that physical changes are temporary. While chemical changes are permanent. Physical and chemical changes both affect the state of matter.

Many people are confused about why our economy went to shambles in 2008. The crisis was actually the result of a combination of many complex factors. First, easy credit conditions allowed people who were high-risk or unworthy of credit to borrow, and even people who had no income were eligible 15 for large loans. Second, banks would bundle these toxic loans and sell them as packages on the financial market. Third, large insurance firms backed these packages, misrepresenting these high-risk loans as safe investments. Fourth, because of the ease of acquiring credit and the rapid growth in the housing market, people were buying two or three houses, intending to sell them for more than they paid. All of these factors created bubbles of speculation. These bubbles burst, sending the whole market into a downward spiral, causing employers to lose capital and lay off employees. Consumer spending then dropped and most businesses suffered. The economy is like a big boat, and once it gets moving quickly in the wrong direction, it's hard to turn it around.

                            7. 1. All things can be changed in two ways: chemically and physically. Both chemical and physical changes affect the state of matter. Physical changes are those that do not change the identity of the matter. For instance, clay will bend if squeezed. Still it will be a clay. Change in shape is a physical change. It does not change the matter's identity. Chemical changes turn the matter into a new kind of matter with different properties. For instance, when paper is burnt, it becomes ash. It will never be paper again. The difference between them is that physical changes are temporary. While chemical changes are permanent. Physical and chemical changes both affect the state of matter.

Many people are confused about why our economy went to shambles in 2008. The crisis was actually the result of a combination of many complex factors. First, easy credit conditions allowed people who were high-risk or unworthy of credit to borrow, and even people who had no income were eligible 15 for large loans. Second, banks would bundle these toxic loans and sell them as packages on the financial market. Third, large insurance firms backed these packages, misrepresenting these high-risk loans as safe investments. Fourth, because of the ease of acquiring credit and the rapid growth in the housing market, people were buying two or three houses, intending to sell them for more than they paid. All of these factors created bubbles of speculation. These bubbles burst, sending the whole market into a downward spiral, causing employers to lose capital and lay off employees. Consumer spending then dropped and most businesses suffered. The economy is like a big boat, and once it gets moving quickly in the wrong direction, it's hard to turn it around.

</strong></p><p><strong>I'm thinking of two men from Chicago They are both quite successful  </strong></p><p><strong>Similar background Educated, they worked for a corporation for many years and they were in the group of people who were fired Two people who were very good friends One went to look for work for several weeks next to the other and they are disappointed and reject them again and again They could not find any work  </strong></p><p><strong>One of them stopped, was discouraged stopped looking for work, he stayed at home watching television He became a fighter and toxic guy with his wife Drinking beer, talking on the phone with his other negative and unemployed friends And he gave up The other guy kept looking for work in every place he could, every opportunity that was presented to him, he kept asking for work Making contacts, checking the newspapers every day  </strong></p><p><strong>He kept going to every place he could trying to get a job And they said "you have a lot of education, you are overqualified, you will not last long" He kept introducing himself to every opportunity He went to a place and said: "Look, I tell you what, if you can not hire me and I know that you can use my talents, abilities and skills " "I do not want to stay at home doing anything, just let me do some volunteer work" "You do not have to give me anything in return, okay? I just want to work and be busy" And they responded, "ok, it's your responsibility, but do not expect me to give you anything in return" This guy came and worked hard, he was the first to arrive and the last to leave  </strong></p><p><strong>He was the best employee in the place At 4 weeks one of the managers above resigned And they were looking for a replacement, guess who they chose? This guy, this person who volunteered his time He got the job What was the difference between the two friends? Sight and vision Vista means judging based on what you see  </strong></p><p><strong>Judge based on appearances But vision means how you interpret what you see The first guy said: "It's not possible, it's over, it's over, I can not do it, I can not do it" He gave up "I faced rejection over and over and over again, I'm not going to go anymore, there's no work" But this other guy, he felt that despite the "NO" and the rejections, despite the bad economy, despite what the newspapers say believe that it is possible  </strong></p><p><strong>That someone somewhere will give him work He went ahead thinking it was possible And guess what ladies and gentlemen, that's what we have to do with our dreams Because things happen in our lives that we never but never can anticipate and when those things happen, you want to give up Never let anyone tell you you can not do something​
