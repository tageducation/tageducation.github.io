                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>I can describe it as somewhat parasitic, in this past year I think. As we all know, mankind has not been kind to the environment. A lot of the forest today is reduced to nothing, plenty of waters have been polluted because of toxic waste, and the habitats of other animals is in the brink of nothingness. To put it bluntly, it is bad. Instead of all of us taking care of the planet, it seems that we do more harm than good. Whilst, there are programs and activists out there fighting to make the environment better. I think it is not enough. Our planet's temperature is rising, the polar ice caps are melting, and sea levels are rising. Not only that, a lot of waste have dump on the see making marine wildlife more vulnerable, animals are forced out of there natural habitat, which in turn endangering other animals such as ourselves (Frankly I think some people deserve it), a lot of species of animals are either endangered, critically endangered, or extinct. Mankind is unrest, because Covid and political matters is getting rocky. So, what more can I say.</p><br />

</p><p>1. What is the moral conveyed in the poem? Is it explicit or implicit? Explain.
</p><p>It is implicit because the poem did deliver the message well, but not plainly.
</p><p>2. What does the poem say about human nature when it comes to decision-making?
</p><p>"The Road Not Taken" is an ambiguous poem that allows the reader to think about choices in life, whether to go with the mainstream or go it alone. If life is a journey, this poem highlights those times in life when a decision has to be made.
</p><p>3. How does this poem remind you of the personal choices that you made before?
</p><p>It reminds me of the times when I chose a path that other people chooses less.
</p><p>4. In your point of view, do you think the speaker in the poem is happy about his choice? Why or why not?
</p><p>Yes. The poet(Robert Frost) seems to be happy by deciding the road because he feels that he want to be unique and moreover he just compares the two roads with life. When we choose the difficult option rather than going on a short route. We work hard to reach the destination and be happy at last.
</p><p>5. What are the chances that the speaker will get to come back and try the other path?
</p><p>To be honest, none, because we can’t turn back the time that’s why we have to put much thought into the choices that we make.

                        1) What do you think would have happened had the traveler made a different choice?<p>In every decision in life, we'll encounter such a decision like this. As the question asked, just nóthing but with everything. The traveler chooses a path that he believed to finished. He doubted to be ever going back the way or the road he started to chose right back.</p>2) Does this choice influence his behavior in life? Why?<p>Yes, but some of us just don't count the way you choose, that's why they're trying to brag you about theirs.</p>3) How would you decide if you were in the same situation?<p>Just like him, choosing the way you believe and what you can finish.</p>4) Recall a time when you had to make a difficult decision. Do you think you made the right choice? Was the outcome favorable or not?<p>Yes, there is a time when my dad has a new credit card delivered to our house. I was 14 that year and don't even know a "credit card". I asked my father to let me see the card, then my little mind decided to use it online and purchase something. And that was the biggest mistáke I have ever done in my entire life, I purchased an amount of ₱20,000+. Two months later, my father asked me why is the bank contacting him saying, "You have a due of ₱28,000 ...", and I froze and don't know what to do. Ten months later, he got home from work and knowing what I did and he rebuked me. It was so tèrrifying and that day I learned a lesson, " do not be so ambitious in life, or you'll pay it in the future". Does the outcome favórable? Yes, because I learned from it. Also, no, because I wásted a lot of móney.</p><p></p>Learning Task 11) What is the moral conveyed in the poem? Is it explicit or implicit? Explain.<p>The moral conveyed in the poem is that "trust the way you believe". Well, as I read the poem, it is implicit. Because it explains what he decided or his choice in the poem.</p>2) What does the poem say about human nature when it comes to decision-making?<p>Do not let anything keep you from deciding what you believe, just continue what you started and you'll get the best result.</p>3) How does this poem remind you of the personal choices that you made before?<p>It is so mindful and it helps me aware of something that I decided to chose.</p>4) In your point of view, do you think the speaker in the poem is happy about his choice? Why or why not?<p>For me, yes, he chooses what he believes and thinks he can complete it.</p>5) What are the chances that the speaker will get to come back and try the other path?<p>It relies on the problems and situations. Every one of us has our decision-making problem. Am I right?</p><p></p><p><strong>#BrainliestBunch</strong></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Moral of the poem 'The Road Not Taken' is 'Take your own decisions without any regrets.'</p><p></p><p>"The Road Not Taken" is one of the most celebrated poems of Frost.</p><p></p><p>*The poem primarily celebrates the precipitous individualism and the difficulty which the poet faces in choosing a wise option when life offers him such opportunity.</p><p></p><p>*The moral lesson that Frost conveys through the poem is that whenever life gives us choices, we must make the decisions wisely.</p><p></p><p>*He also says that the decisions must be taken independently without fearing its consequences as it is what 'makes all the difference.'</p><p></p><p>*Frost suggests that one needs to take the challenges and the responsibility of these decisions and never regret it because it is the only way to have a contented and happy life</p><p></p><p>2. I think, poet wants be alone. That's why he had chosen that road where a few people travel. His nature is lonely. And he is a little bit confused about his life and decisions because he had taken so much time for his decision making and after taking decision he felt that he was wrong.</p><p></p><p>3. yes,This poem reminds us of the choices that one makes in his life. There is a fork on the road that the poet comes upon. he has to make his choice.</p><p></p><p>4.Yes. The poet(Robert frost) seems to be happy by deciding the road because he feels that he want to be unique and more over he just compare the two roads with the life. When we choose the difficult option rather than going in short route.. We work hard to reach the destination and be happy at last.</p><p></p><p>5. No, there are no chances for him to come back because once you take a momentous decision in your life you can not take your step back.</p><p></p><p></p><p>#CarryOnLearing</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.	Take time in making decision “and step out of your comfort zone”
</p><p>2.	It says that making life decision are very hard and sometimes “choosing the road less traveled” can make all the difference.
</p><p>3.	It reminds me of the things I could have tried but too scared to do it
</p><p>4.	I think he is because as he said after taking the less traveled road “and that has made all the difference” and no regret is coming out from the words he is telling.
</p><p>5.	It is not likely that he will ever comeback.
