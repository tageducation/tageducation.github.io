You might look for practical problems aimed at contributing to change, or theoretical problems aimed at expanding knowledge.</p><p></p><p>2. The main purposes of research are to inform action, gather evidence for theories, and contribute to developing knowledge in a field of study. ... Yet, for those who like to learn, whether they are members of a research institution or not, conducting research is not just important—it's imperative.</p><p></p><p>3. Research is essential to find out which treatments work better for patients. It plays an important role in discovering new treatments, and making sure that we use existing treatments in the best possible ways.</p><p></p><p>4. Motivation is key to achieving goals. Set goals that relate to the high priorities in your life. Without this type of focus, you can end up with far too many goals, leaving you too little time to devote to each one.</p><p></p><p>5. Quantitative information is often called data, but can also be things other than numbers. Qualitative Information – Involves a descriptive judgment using concept words instead of numbers.
