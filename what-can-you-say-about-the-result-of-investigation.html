The literature review originates or is sourced from relevant research. The condition is that the literature review must mention, explain, summarize, evaluate objectively, and clarify previous research.</p><p></p><p><strong>A literature review</strong> is a section that provides practical guidance on a particular topic. This review is especially helpful for those with limited research time. So that the literature review provides an overview of similar studies that will be conducted.</p><p></p><p><strong>7. A.

The highlight ofthe program is the presentation of the festival of dances. The six sections preparedfor the said dance contest during the culmination. A month before the activity, thestudents already started planning. Their parents were also very supportive in thepreparation of their costumes and props. The class advisers also monitored thepractices in their classrooms.During the contest, the PE teacher invited teachers from other schools to serveas a judge. The performances were exemplary, especially the section Rydberg. Thesection was also a crowd favorite. However, another group that performed poorlycompared to Rydberg was pronounced as the winner. Due to the result of the contest,Rydberg and other sections wanted to know the bases for judging. After conductingan investigation, it turned out that no clear criteria were set, and no rating sheets wereused.Guide Questions:1. What do you think must have been done to avoid the said situation?2.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. This situation could have been avoided if the organizers were more organized. They <strong>should have explained the rubrics and criteria </strong>from the very beginning for the sake of clarity.</p><p>2. It is disappointing to hear the result of the investigation. The problem <strong>could have been avoided with simple quantitative measures</strong>. I hope the best team won after this revelation.</p><p>3.
