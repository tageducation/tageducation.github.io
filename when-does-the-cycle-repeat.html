The Phases of Menstrual Cycle
The menstrual phase occurs when fertilization does not take place. The uterine lining begins to break
down and bleeding results, this lasts from 3 to 7 days. The ______________________ phase starts the first
day of ___________________ and ends with ovulation. It takes 13 days for the egg to mature. During the
14th day of menstrual cycle or the ___________________ phase, the egg cell travel to the fallopian tube and
wait for the sperm cell for the fertilization. The fertilization should happen within ___________________
hours, if not the egg cell will shatter. Then, during luteal phase, the wall of the uterus thickens to provide
nutrients for the fertilized egg where it. If the egg is not fertilized by the sperm cell the thick uterine lining
breaks down and comes out of the body through menstruation. Then, the ___________________ repeats</a>

The chromosomes begin to pair off. Pairs of chromosomes are calledhomologous chromosomes, and this pairing process is exact.11. The chromosomes contract due to repeated coiling, Crossing over takes place during thisstage where a segment of a sister chromatid of one chromosome is exchanged with the same segment of the sisterchromatid of the homologous chromosome through the formation of a cross-linkage of the segments called a chiasma12.

                                            Summarize the following article in not more than 120 words
The childhood years are supposed to be the best times of one's life; playing and having fun. Yet there are many children who are deprived of this childhood. They are tortured and verbally and physically abused. There is no reason or excuse for child abuse. Abusers claim they do it because of the stress of work. Child-abusing housewives way they feel harassed by a crying child and are unable to curb their own fury, especially if no support is received from anyone. This is not surprising since support is extended to a victim of child abuse more readily than to the perpetrator. Occasionally, parents may vent their frustrations on their child if they fight and quarrel with each other. In cases like there, it is the children who are the victims.
In this modern age where both parents are usually holding jobs, children are left with babysitters and nurseries. Abuse by these carers may occur when there are too many children to be minded. The disappearance of the extended family system is partly to be blamed for these incidents.. Crowded homes and financial problems can also lead to child abuse. When there are too many mouths to feed,
parents feel the pressure and prevent their anger on a child. Substance abuse is another factor which increases the incidents of child abuse. Under the influence of alcohol or drugs, a parent many not know what he or she may be doing. Or, rather, knows what he or she is doing but is not bothered at all. A drug addict many experience mood swings and is easily provoked by a crying baby. Thus we see and read horrifying reports of a child being savagely tortured and dumped elsewhere, like garbage.
Psychologists believe that child abusers may have been victims of abuse themselves. Thus, in anger and hatred, they repeat the vicious cycle of abuse. Some have no love for the children they abuse. Some have been brought up to believe that children should be beaten in order to maintain control. These are troubled people who need help.
A home is supposed to be a haven where a child ought to feel safe and secure. Unfortunately, more often than not, the home is also where a child is abused. Whatever the reasons for the abuse, something must be done to stop the cruelty and help these parents who simply cannot cope with parenting. Parents-to-be should be counseled and inculcated with parenting skills. The Child Protection Act which was passed in Parliament in 1991 does not effectively prevent child abuse. Stricter enforcement is necessary. Thus. It requires a commitment from each individual to help families with victims, and troubled parents, the perpetrators.</a>

                            1. when does the cycle repeat?</h2><br />
                        <p>The refrigeration cycle repeats when the water vapor transforms to liquid and can be recycled again. Once it becomes liquid, it can now be subjected to evaporation and then compression which continues the cycle. In a single-stage vapor compression refrigeration cycle, Freon enters the compressor. Freon or any liquid refrigerant is present in any refrigerator unit.  </p><p>
</p>What happens inside the refrigerator?
<p>The cooling agent or refrigerant enters the compressor and undergoes pressure. When there is <strong>pressure</strong>, the liquid heats up and it produces heated water vapor. The water vapor then enters the condenser and is cooled to become liquid. The heat is dissipated to the environment. This is why when you touch the back of the refrigerator there is heat. </p><p></p><p>In this process, heat is removed from the equation and cooled air is retained. This is now what cools the entire refrigerator. The <strong>expansion valve</strong>, meanwhile regulates the whole process. When the liquid from the compressor passes through the expansion valve, t he pressure significantly drops, thereby decreasing the temperature further. The mixture of liquid and vapor moves to the evaporator and is vaporized. The vapor then returns to the inlet of the compressor repeating the cycle.
</p><p>
</p><p>When there is not enough Freon or there is a break in the cycle, it will result in cooling being <strong>ineffective</strong>. In many cases, you just need to add Freon (as in the case of car aircons) but when the compressor is damaged, then it is better to replace the whole refrigerator.

<p>
</p><p><strong>A cycle repeats itself whenever the process ends and goes back to the starting point. This is observable everywhere, and here are some examples:
</strong></p>The life cycle of a<strong> frog,</strong> the animal starts out from eggs and goes through the process of metamorphosis to later become frogs themselves. Once matured, they will mate and release eggs into the water which restarts the cycle all over again.  <p>
</p>The<strong> water </strong>on earth goes through the cycle of turning into vapor and then collects as clouds. They will then fall back to earth in whatever form of precipitation possible in the environment. They flow into canals, streams, rivers, and others. They would then make their way back into the seas and oceans, thereby ending the cycle. It is here that it goes back to the starting point. The whole process repeats endlessly in a perpetual cycle.

The Phases of Menstrual Cycle
The menstrual phase occurs when fertilization does not take place. The uterine lining begins to break
down and bleeding results, this lasts from 3 to 7 days. The ______________________ phase starts the first
day of ___________________ and ends with ovulation. It takes 13 days for the egg to mature. During the
14th day of menstrual cycle or the ___________________ phase, the egg cell travel to the fallopian tube and
wait for the sperm cell for the fertilization. The fertilization should happen within ___________________
hours, if not the egg cell will shatter. Then, during luteal phase, the wall of the uterus thickens to provide
nutrients for the fertilized egg where it. If the egg is not fertilized by the sperm cell the thick uterine lining
breaks down and comes out of the body through menstruation. Then, the ___________________ repeats</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>The Vapor - Compression Cycle or otherwise known as Refrigeration Cycle. </strong></p><p></p><p>The process that takes place inside the refrigerator is the "<strong>Refrigeration Cycle</strong>" </p><p></p><p>For us to be able to know better <strong>when</strong> and <strong>on</strong> <strong>what part</strong> of the refrigerator is the cycle repeating, let us first define terms:</p><strong>fluid refrigerant</strong> - cooling medium or the chemical inside the tubes of the system. Its main property should have a <strong>low boiling point, Sensitive to heat absorption, Pressure of evaporation is higher than atmospheric pressure</strong> and <strong>high evaporation rate</strong>.<strong>compressor</strong> - It is the heart of the system as it is keeps the refrigerant flowing. <strong>condenser coils</strong> - the black coils found at the back of the fridge. It cools and condenses the refrigerant.<strong>evaporator coils</strong> - the coils on the inside of the fridge.<strong>expansion device</strong> - devices used to control the refrigerant flow in a refrigeration system. They help to facilitate the change of higher pressure of liquid refrigerant in the condensing unit to lower pressure gas refrigerant in the evaporator.<strong>refrigeration cycle</strong> - Is a continuous cycle of vapor-compression of a circulating liquid refrigerant as the medium which absorbs and removes heat from the space to be cooled and subsequently rejects that heat elsewhere.<p></p><p><strong>The refrigeration cycle starts as it enters the Compressor.</strong><strong> </strong></p><p>(To imagine clearly the compressor, it is usually the black cylinder found at the bottom of the refrigerator. If you can't see it that is the refrigerator component that you usually you hear whenever nearby a refrigerator.)</p><p>But since it is a cycle, basically it is just the starting point of the process.</p>In the compressor the refrigerant is compressed and heats up. <strong>(Temperature is increasing, Pressure increases)</strong>The refrigerant then goes through the condenser coils where its temperature is being lowered as it passes through the coils with air fins. (air fins help in the cooling down of the fluid as it divides the surface area of the coils into smaller ones making it more efficient to release heat into the air) <strong>(Temperature decreases, Pressure decreases)</strong>The high pressure liquid refrigerant then flows through an expansion valve or capillary tubes to reduce its pressure, and regulate its flow into the evaporator.  (In this point the refrigerant is cooler as heat is already released as it passed through the condenser coils, and becomes much cooler as it passes through the expansion valve. At this stage also in the refrigeration cycle, high pressure liquid refrigerant will flow down the liquid line, through a filter-drier that is designed to prevent contaminants from flowing through the system, and on to the metering device.) <strong>(Temperature decreases, Pressure decreases)</strong>In the evaporator, the <strong>low pressure liquid refrigerant absorbs heat from the fridge interior</strong>, changing to a low pressure gas in the process, and then flows on again to the compressor.<p></p><p>This process will continue throughout the lifespan of the refrigerator, this is also the cycle used in air conditioning systems or anything that requires the removal of heat in a certain space. </p><p></p><p>More information about how a refrigerator works on the link below:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/541471</p><p></p><p>-engrjethermec</p><br />

More details can be found below.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>3.When </strong><strong>does </strong><strong>the </strong><strong>cycle </strong><strong>repeat</strong><strong>?</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>The refrigeration cycle begins by the heat being absorbed by the refrigerant, cooling the air inside the evaporator (low pressure). The cooled air is then transferred to the compressor (high pressure). When air is compressed, it heats up. The greater the heat, the more high pressure gas is produced. This is the gas that is described in the process above. Now, as refrigerant passes through high pressure to low pressure, the expansion valve acts a regulator to the process. With reduced pressure, the expansion valve allows the liquid refrigerant to be at its coolest. Remember that when pressure is added, the temperature increases and vice versa.</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>KEEP LEARNING!!BRAINLY THIS THANKS!!<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Refrigerators work by causing the refrigerant circulating inside them to change from a liquid into a gas. This process, called evaporation, cools the surrounding area and produces the desired effect.</p><p>2. When a hot gas is being compressed, its temperature also increases. When temperature increases, more heat is produced.</p><p>2. The refrigerator cycle repeats when the water vapor transforms to liquid. </p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Answer:</p>	Q1. How does a refrigerator work?<p>           •Refrigerators work by causing the refrigerant circulating inside them to change from a liquid into a gas.</p><p></p>  Q2. Describe a compressor. How does it work? What gas is inside the compressor which has a low boiling point?<p>           •A refrigerant like freon is needed to have low boiling point in order for the compressor to require less amount of energy in doing its work. The freon gas is then compressed by a compressor to a high pressure resulting to an increase in temperature and becomes hot gas.</p><p></p>     Q3. What happens to the hot gas produced by compression?<p>           •The hot gas produced by compression in the refrigeration cycle is transferred to the condenser. The condenser then dissipates the heat from the refrigerant to the outside air. ... The refrigerant in effect turns the vapor into hot liquid as a result of the high pressure and reduction in temperature.</p><p></p>      Q4. How does a condenser function?<p>   •The function of the condenser in a refrigeration system is to transfer heat from the refrigerant to another medium, such as air and/or water. By rejecting heat, the gaseous refrigerant condenses to liquid inside the condenser. The major types of condensers used are (1) water-cooled, (2) air-cooled, and (3) evaporative.</p><p></p>      Q5. What happens to the pressure and heat in the evaporator?<p>           •In an evaporator, the pressure is reduced and the heat is being absorbed by the refrigerant.</p><p></p>       Q6. When does the cycle repeat?<p>  •Expert Verified</p><p>Expert VerifiedThe refrigeration cycle repeats when the water vapor transforms to liquid and can be recycled again. Once it becomes liquid, it can now be subjected to evaporation and then compression which continues the cycle.</p><p>⊂(◉‿◉)つ</p><p>⊹⊱—━━━━</p><br />

                            23. Summarize the following article in not more than 120 words
The childhood years are supposed to be the best times of one's life; playing and having fun. Yet there are many children who are deprived of this childhood. They are tortured and verbally and physically abused. There is no reason or excuse for child abuse. Abusers claim they do it because of the stress of work. Child-abusing housewives way they feel harassed by a crying child and are unable to curb their own fury, especially if no support is received from anyone. This is not surprising since support is extended to a victim of child abuse more readily than to the perpetrator. Occasionally, parents may vent their frustrations on their child if they fight and quarrel with each other. In cases like there, it is the children who are the victims.
In this modern age where both parents are usually holding jobs, children are left with babysitters and nurseries. Abuse by these carers may occur when there are too many children to be minded. The disappearance of the extended family system is partly to be blamed for these incidents.. Crowded homes and financial problems can also lead to child abuse. When there are too many mouths to feed,
parents feel the pressure and prevent their anger on a child. Substance abuse is another factor which increases the incidents of child abuse. Under the influence of alcohol or drugs, a parent many not know what he or she may be doing. Or, rather, knows what he or she is doing but is not bothered at all. A drug addict many experience mood swings and is easily provoked by a crying baby. Thus we see and read horrifying reports of a child being savagely tortured and dumped elsewhere, like garbage.
Psychologists believe that child abusers may have been victims of abuse themselves. Thus, in anger and hatred, they repeat the vicious cycle of abuse. Some have no love for the children they abuse. Some have been brought up to believe that children should be beaten in order to maintain control. These are troubled people who need help.
A home is supposed to be a haven where a child ought to feel safe and secure. Unfortunately, more often than not, the home is also where a child is abused. Whatever the reasons for the abuse, something must be done to stop the cruelty and help these parents who simply cannot cope with parenting. Parents-to-be should be counseled and inculcated with parenting skills. The Child Protection Act which was passed in Parliament in 1991 does not effectively prevent child abuse. Stricter enforcement is necessary. Thus. It requires a commitment from each individual to help families with victims, and troubled parents, the perpetrators.</h2><br />
