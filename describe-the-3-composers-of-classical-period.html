                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Franz Joseph Haydn </p><p></p><p>A central characteristic of Haydn's music is the development of larger structures out of very short, simple musical motifs, often derived from standard accompanying figures. The music is often quite formally concentrated, and the important musical events of a movement can unfold rather quickly.</p><p></p><p></p><p>2. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart</p><p></p><p>The central traits of the classical style are all present in Mozart's music. Clarity, balance, and transparency are the hallmarks of his work, but simplistic notions of its delicacy mask the exceptional power of his finest masterpieces, such as the Piano Concerto No.</p><p></p><p></p><p>3. Ludwig Van Beethoven </p><p>His late period works were characterized by formal, harmonic, and structural experimentation at the highest level, often pointing toward contrapuntal tendencies and microscopic textures, as well as an increasingly introverted compositional outlook.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The First Viennese School is a name mostly used to refer to three composers of the Classical period in late-18th-century Vienna: Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven. Franz Schubert is occasionally added to the list.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Franz Joseph Haydn (1732-1809)</p><p>Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756-1791)</p><p>Ludwig van Beethoven (1770-1827)</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Haydn</strong>. Franz Joseph Haydn was born in the Rohrau, Austria, in 1732. At age eight he was accepted as a choirboy at St. Stephen's Cathedral in Vienna. When he left St. Stephen's in 1749, he became an assistant to Nicola Porpora. In 1759, he worked briefly as musical director for Count Morzin, and in 1761 was employed as assistant music director and then music director for the Esterhazy family, residing at their estate. He remained with the Esterhazys for nearly thirty years, until 1790.</p><p></p><p><strong>Mozart</strong>. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was born in Salzburg, Austria, in 1756. At the age of six, he could play the harpsichord and violin, compose, and performed in Munich and Vienna. Between the ages of six and fifteen, Mozart was taken on tours of Europe and England, organized by his father, Leopold Mozart, a Salzburg court composer. Although he was away from home more than half of the time, he produced a steady stream of compositions during this period.</p><p></p><p><strong>Beethoven</strong>. Ludwig van Beethoven was born in Bonn, Germany, in 1770. He came to Vienna in 1792, where he studied with Haydn and Albrechtsberger. His first public performances in Vienna as a pianist and composer came in 1795. </p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The Classical period falls between the Baroque and the Romantic periods. Classical music has a lighter, clearer texture than Baroque music and is less complex. It is mainly homophonic, using a clear melody line over a subordinate chordal accompaniment,[2] but counterpoint was by no means forgotten, especially later in the period. It also makes use of style galant which emphasized light elegance in place of the Baroque's dignified seriousness and impressive grandeur. Variety and contrast within a piece became more pronounced than before and the orchestra increased in size, range, and power.</p><br />
