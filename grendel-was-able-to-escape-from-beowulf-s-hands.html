His heart was giggling as he <strong>enjoyed</strong> the sight and intended to snuff out the life from those bodies. The monster's mind was heated by morning.</p><p></p><p>His gut would soon become aware of the eating and the prospect of food. But that evening, Grendel was destined to munch on the dismembered remains of his last human meal. His nefarious steps were being watched by human eyes, watching for his quick, powerful claws.</p><p></p><p>Grendel grabbed the first person who came to him, tore him apart with his mighty teeth, tore his corpse to pieces, drank the blood from his veins, and fled.</p><p></p>2.
