                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>A. TROPOSPHERE</p><p></p><p>The troposphere is the first and lowest layer of the atmosphere of the Earth, and contains 75% of the total mass of the planetary atmosphere, 99% of the total mass of water vapour and aerosols, and is where most weather phenomenon occur. </p><p></p><p>B. STRATOSPHERE</p><p></p><p>The stratosphere is a layer of Earth's atmosphere. It is the second layer of the atmosphere as you go upward. The troposphere, the lowest layer, is right below the stratosphere. ... The lower boundary of the stratosphere is called the tropopause; the upper boundary is called the stratopause.</p><p></p><p>C. MESOSPHERE</p><p></p><p></p><p>The mesosphere is a layer of Earth's atmosphere. The mesosphere is directly above the stratosphere and below the thermosphere. It extends from about 50 to 85 km (31 to 53 miles) above our planet. Temperature decreases with height throughout the mesosphere. ... Most meteors vaporize in the mesosphere.</p><p></p><p>D. THERMOSPHERE</p><p></p><p>The thermosphere is the layer in the Earth's atmosphere directly above the mesosphere and below the exosphere. Within this layer of the atmosphere, ultraviolet radiation causes photoionization/photodissociation of molecules, creating ions; the thermosphere thus constitutes the larger part of the ionosphere</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p>need points lg po salamat</p><br />
