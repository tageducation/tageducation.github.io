                                            ACTIVITY 2 Read the short passage carefully. Pay attention to the underlined italicized words. Mary and I have been friends since elementary. We have many things in common. We both love to read novels, watch K-dramas and hang out with other friends. Likewise, we love music. As a result, every moment with her was fun. We had countless experiences. There were no dull moments when we're together but one day, things had changed. We had a petty quarrel. In that case, we stopped seeing and talking for quite a time. However, deep within, I knew that we could patch things up because we knew each other very well. And exactly, just I expected, we became friends again. We forgave each other, moved on and now we are even closer. 1. What words are underlined? 2. Did you use words similar to these in doing your activity 1?​</a>

Likewise, we love music. As a result, every moment with her was fun. We had countless experiences. There were no dull moments when we're together but one day, things had changed. We had a petty quarrel. In that case, we stopped seeing and talking for quite a time. However, deep within, I knew that we could patch things up because we knew each other very well. And exactly, just I expected, we became friends again. We forgave each other, moved on and now we are even closer. 1. What words are underlined? 2.

                            22. Mary and I have been friends since elementary. We have many things in common. We both love to read novels, watch K-dramas and hang out with other friends. Likewise, we love music. As a result, every moment with her was fun. We had countless experiences. There were no dull moments when we're together but one day, things had changed. We had a petty quarrel. In that case, we stopped seeing and talking for quite a time. However, deep within, I knew that we could patch things up because we knew each other very well. And exactly, just I expected, we became friends again. We forgave each other, moved on and now we are even closer. 1. What words are underlined? 2.

                        <p><strong>I do very well at cooking and swimming.</strong></p><strong>Cooking </strong><p>Cooking is the activity of preparing food to be eaten by heating it so that it can be consumed. Cooking consists of various methods, techniques, equipment, and combinations of spices to adjust the taste to make food easier to digest and change food in terms of color, appearance, taste, texture, appearance and nutritional value.</p><p>Cooking in general is the preparation and process of selecting, adjusting the quantity, and mixing food ingredients in a certain order with the aim of getting the desired result. Heating foodstuffs generally, although not always, changes the food ingredients chemically, resulting in changes in taste, texture, appearance, and nutritional value.</p><p></p><strong>Swimming </strong><p>Swimming is one of the most popular aquatic sports in the world. In a competition, victory in a swimming race is determined by the speed of time. However, swimming can also be done by anyone, not just athletes.</p><p>Swimming can be done for recreational purposes, hobbies, refreshing, health therapy, etc. Swimming is a very fun water sport and is beneficial for the strength of the muscles of the body, heart, lungs, and also helps increase feelings of courage.</p><p><strong>Types of Swimming Style Swimming style is divided into four types, namely:</strong></p>Freestyle<p>This freestyle is the easiest swimming style to do. In addition, this freestyle is the fastest style in swimming when compared to others. Freestyle is a movement that is done by lying face down, where the hands and feet pull and kick water. Freestyle swimming is also known as freestyle.</p>Breast Style<p>The breaststroke is a swimming technique in which the body position is like crawling on the surface of the water and then combined with the movement of the legs and arms. Freestyle swimming is also known as the breaststroke and is often known as the frog stroke. This breaststroke or frog style is one type of swimming style that can be done in a relaxed manner and is quite easy to learn.</p>Back style<p>In the backstroke, the position of the front body and face is facing up. The practice is not much different from the freestyle, because the right and left hands will be lifted alternately.</p>Butterfly Style<p>The butterfly stroke is a swimming style that is done with both arms simultaneously pedaling forward. Both arms stretched and then flapped to pedal forward. In addition, the rhythm of the feet also moves in unison like a mermaid.</p><p> </p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/18816041</p><p>#SPJ2</p><p></p><br />
