Good Day to the people of OLONGAPO City, I know that we are all worried because of the corona virus or what we call COVID 19. I understand your anxiety but this is not the time to panic. First of all, I want you to know that your government, both national and local, each department of the government here in OLONGAPO City, is working hard to monitor and fight the corona virus. You can count on it that we will give you all the necessary information that we can get, we will give it to you because that is your privilege. I want to inform the people of OLONGAPO City, that based on the findings, definitely the spread of corona virus is not airborne, meaning to say when someone coughs, sneezes or if your hands are not clean, that is when the virus transfers, you need not worry if you’re inside a room with someone who has a possibility to have corona virus, it doesn’t mean to say that you might acquire the virus, In addition to this, face mask is essential, but it is more important to always wash your hands and observe proper hygiene , although of course, some of you would still want to use face mask, it is also good for you, it will give you peace of mind as well, those who would like to have face mask we are giving free mask in the city hall of OLONGAPO . I want you prices, the masks, and the alcohol. We are also monitoring the hospital, and city health, these facilities are both ready if ever there is a need to take an action. Do not worry, we are together against this pandemic. My last call is that let’s trust and help one another. I would also like to call the attention of those who are not feeling well, do not be afraid to go to your nearest station, we got a lot of stations here where you can when the need requires it. We are just here if you are sick, do not worry, we are going to help you, together, and we will help each other for you to recover so that we could avoid infecting others. Let us help and trust each other, I know we can overcome this pandemic, the Philippines and the whole world. God Bless OLONGAPO ! God Bless everyone! Everyone, please stay safe. THANK YOU!

Good Day to the people of OLONGAPO City, I know that we are all worried because of the corona virus or what we call COVID 19. I understand your anxiety but this is not the time to panic. First of all, I want you to know that your government, both national and local, each department of the government here in OLONGAPO City, is working hard to monitor and fight the corona virus. You can count on it that we will give you all the necessary information that we can get, we will give it to you because that is your privilege. I want to inform the people of OLONGAPO City, that based on the findings, definitely the spread of corona virus is not airborne, meaning to say when someone coughs, sneezes or if your hands are not clean, that is when the virus transfers, you need not worry if you’re inside a room with someone who has a possibility to have corona virus, it doesn’t mean to say that you might acquire the virus, In addition to this, face mask is essential, but it is more important to always wash your hands and observe proper hygiene , although of course, some of you would still want to use face mask, it is also good for you, it will give you peace of mind as well, those who would like to have face mask we are giving free mask in the city hall of OLONGAPO . I want you prices, the masks, and the alcohol. We are also monitoring the hospital, and city health, these facilities are both ready if ever there is a need to take an action. Do not worry, we are together against this pandemic. My last call is that let’s trust and help one another. I would also like to call the attention of those who are not feeling well, do not be afraid to go to your nearest station, we got a lot of stations here where you can when the need requires it. We are just here if you are sick, do not worry, we are going to help you, together, and we will help each other for you to recover so that we could avoid infecting others. Let us help and trust each other, I know we can overcome this pandemic, the Philippines and the whole world. God Bless OLONGAPO ! God Bless everyone! Everyone, please stay safe. THANK YOU!
